# Figure 4 Correlation Analysis - Explanation & Interpretation

You were absolutely right! The original dual-panel heatmap had serious issues with missing annotations. I've created improved versions that are much more rigorous and interpretable.

---

## 🚨 **Problems with Original Dual-Panel Figure**

❌ **Original Issues:**
- Numbers were masked/hidden due to triangular masking
- Poor readability and contrast
- Confusing interpretation (which panel shows what?)
- Not publication-ready quality

---

## ✅ **Improved Versions Created**

### **Version 1: Side-by-Side Comparison** ⭐ **RECOMMENDED**
**File**: `figure_4_correlation_heatmap_sidebyside.png`

✅ **Clear Layout**: Left panel = Pearson, Right panel = Spearman
✅ **All Numbers Visible**: Bold, large annotations on both matrices
✅ **Easy Interpretation**: Direct comparison between linear and rank correlations
✅ **Publication Ready**: High DPI, proper color contrast

**How to Interpret:**
- **Left Panel (Pearson r)**: Measures linear relationships
- **Right Panel (Spearman ρ)**: Measures monotonic relationships (more robust)
- **Compare Values**: Large differences suggest non-linear relationships

### **Version 2: Triangular Matrix** 
**File**: `figure_4_correlation_heatmap_triangular.png`

✅ **Space Efficient**: Upper triangle = Pearson, Lower triangle = Spearman
✅ **Complete Information**: All correlation values visible in one figure
✅ **Clear Legend**: Explains which triangle shows what

### **Version 3: Complete Interpretation Guide** 🎯 **MOST COMPREHENSIVE**
**File**: `figure_4_correlation_interpretation_guide.png`

✅ **Four-Panel Layout**: 
- Panel A: Spearman correlations
- Panel B: Pearson correlations  
- Panel C: Difference matrix (Pearson - Spearman)
- Panel D: Correlation strength interpretation guide

✅ **Educational Value**: Shows how to interpret correlation magnitudes
✅ **Identifies Non-linearity**: Highlights where linear vs rank correlations differ

## 📊 **Key Correlation Findings** (From Improved Analysis)

### **Strong Correlations (|ρ| > 0.5)**

| **Relationship** | **Pearson r** | **Spearman ρ** | **Interpretation** |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Diversity ↔ Semantic Continuity** | **-0.766** | **-0.733** | Strong negative: diversity sacrifices coherence |
| **Diversity ↔ Fluency (PPL)** | **+0.737** | **+0.682** | Strong positive: diversity reduces fluency |

### **Important Moderate Correlations**

| **Relationship** | **Pearson r** | **Spearman ρ** | **Note** |
|------------------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Semantic Continuity ↔ Error Rate** | **-0.637** | **-0.373** | ⚠️ Large difference suggests non-linear relationship |
| **Diversity ↔ Error Rate** | **+0.273** | **+0.334** | Moderate positive correlation |

## 📝 **Rigorous Interpretation Examples**

### **Primary Findings**
**"Diversity and semantic continuity demonstrate a strong negative correlation (Pearson r = -0.766, Spearman ρ = -0.733), indicating that lexical diversity consistently comes at the cost of narrative coherence across both linear and non-linear relationships."**

**"The strong positive correlation between diversity and perplexity (Pearson r = +0.737, Spearman ρ = +0.682) confirms that increased vocabulary diversity systematically reduces language model fluency predictions."**

### **Non-Linear Relationship Detection** 
**"Semantic continuity and error rate show a notable difference between Pearson (r = -0.637) and Spearman (ρ = -0.373) correlations, suggesting a non-linear relationship where the benefit of coherence on grammatical accuracy may diminish at higher coherence levels."**
