# Structure Integrity Analysis Report (Hybrid Approach)

## Executive Summary
This report analyzes the structural integrity of 57 generated stories across 3 genres and 2 structure types using a **hybrid theoretical-empirical approach**.

## Methodology Innovation
**Hybrid Approach**: TP Coverage as hard gate (≥1.0 required) + 3-component weighted complexity scoring with theoretical baseline + data-driven adjustment (±15%).

## Key Findings

### 1. TP Gate Analysis (New)
- **Gate threshold**: ≥1.0 coverage required for complexity scoring
- **Pass rate**: 100.0% (54/54 samples)
- **Failed samples**: 0 (excluded from complexity scoring)
- **Assessment**: All Passed (100%)

### 2. Chapter Distribution Analysis
- **Average chapters per story**: 6.9
- **Optimal range adherence** (5-8 chapters): 96.3%
- **Chapter score average**: 0.963
- **Assessment**: Optimal (96% in 5-8 range)

### 3. Li Function Diversity Analysis
- **Average diversity score**: 8.6
- **High diversity stories** (≥9): 59.3%
- **Assessment**: Rich (avg≈8.6, 59%≥9)

### 4. Event-Length Balance Analysis
- **Events-Words correlation**: 0.323
- **Average event density**: 7.3 events/1000 words
- **Assessment**: Well-balanced (r≈0.32)

### 5. Structure Complexity Analysis (Hybrid)
- **Mean complexity** (all samples): 0.755
- **Mean complexity** (passed samples only): 0.769
- **Assessment**: High (mean≈0.75)

## Weight Configuration Evolution

### Theoretical Baseline → Data-Driven Adjustment → Final Hybrid Weights

### Weight Evolution: Theoretical → Data-Driven → Final Hybrid

| Component | Theoretical Baseline | Quality Correlation | Data Adjustment | Final Weight | Net Change |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| Chapter Score (Miller认知负荷) | 50.0% | r=0.091 | +1.4% | **49.6%** | -0.4% |
| Li Function Diversity (Shannon信息熵) | 30.0% | r=0.011 | +0.2% | **29.4%** | -0.6% |
| Event Density (McKee节奏理论) | 20.0% | r=0.472 | +7.1% | **21.0%** | +1.0% |

**Hybrid Weight Summary:**
- **TP Coverage Role**: Hard Gate (≥1.0 required, not weighted)
- **TP Pass Rate**: 100.0% (['chapter_score', 'li_function_diversity', 'event_density'] components weighted)
- **Max Data Adjustment**: ±7.1% (within ±15% limit)
- **Weight Profile Used**: Hybrid
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Miller + Shannon + McKee theories
- **Empirical Calibration**: Quality correlation-based ±15% micro-adjustment

## Recommendations

### 1. Chapter Structure (High Priority)
- **Issue**: Only 96.3% of stories have optimal chapter count (5-8)
- **Recommendation**: Focus on generating stories with 5-8 chapters for optimal narrative structure


## Methodology (Hybrid Approach)

### Core Innovation: Hybrid Theoretical-Empirical Framework
1. **TP Coverage Hard Gate**: Must achieve ≥1.0 coverage to qualify for complexity scoring (Propp/Campbell structural completeness)
2. **3-Component Complexity Scoring**: Only for TP-qualified samples using weighted combination
3. **Weight Determination**: Theoretical baseline (Miller/Shannon/McKee) + data-driven adjustment (±15% max)

### Component Analysis:
1. **Chapter Score**: Peak scoring at 5-8 chapters (Miller's 7±2 cognitive load theory)
2. **Li Function Diversity**: Information entropy balance (Shannon theory)  
3. **Event Density**: Pacing regulation (McKee tempo theory, empirically enhanced)
4. **TP Coverage**: Structural prerequisite (Propp morphology, hard gate implementation)

### Statistical Validation:
- **Sample separation**: 54 main + 3 baseline
- **Correlation analysis**: Both Pearson and Spearman with constant column exclusion
- **Weight adjustment**: Based on correlation with balanced quality target (0.5×coherence + 0.5×diversity)

## Data Quality
- Total stories analyzed: 57
- Main experimental samples: 54
