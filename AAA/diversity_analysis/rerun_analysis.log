============================================================
ENHANCED DIVERSITY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
============================================================
🔧 Metric consistency: Fixed
⚖️ Alpha rebalancing: 0.392 → 0.392
📊 Stable combinations: 18
📈 Enhanced diversity: 77.8% high diversity
🎯 Balanced alpha: 100.0% in target range

🔧 Addressed Critical Issues:
  ✅ Fixed metric naming consistency
  ✅ Rebalanced alpha weights to target range
  ✅ Added stability analysis with CV thresholds
  ✅ Enhanced statistical testing with effect sizes
  ✅ Formal temperature analysis with mixed-effects
