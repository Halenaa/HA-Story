She pulls a slim, high-end leather suitcase—its brand new sheen standing out in the crowd—behind her, signaling her newfound wealth. Marek Visser, leaning against a pillar and observing the flow of commuters, notices Xiao Fang's deliberate movements and expensive luggage. He approaches her, wiping rain from his glasses, and offers a folded city map in exchange for a briefcase of cash she nonchalantly reveals, testing his intentions. Xiao Fang hands him a business card with only a phone number and says, 'Meet me at the Oude Kerk at noon. Don't be late.' Marek nods, pocketing the card and glancing at the suitcase, weighing his options. Xiao Fang strides out into the rain, hailing a black Mercedes taxi with a crisp wave and stepping inside, leaving Marek to study the card and make his decision. The objective is to establish Xiao Fang's entry, display her resources, and initiate the first contact with Marek; as a result, a tentative alliance is set in motion.",

The café’s owner glances nervously at the visible cash, and Xiao Fang meets his eye, tapping the table with a manicured nail as a silent warning. The stack of money on the table and Xiao Fang's unflinching gaze signal her newfound financial power, intimidating both Marek and the onlookers.

She gestures for Marek to sit at the velvet lounge near the window, displaying casual authority. Marek settles in, notebook in hand, scanning the cityscape before speaking: 'The syndicate's spiritual influence is waning. Our methods are working.' Xiao Fang hands him a glass, then opens a silver laptop, projecting financial ledgers and coded communications onto a sleek wall screen. She points at a highlighted transaction—evidence of a rival's resource drain—her tone measured: 'We buy their silence and their loyalty. Everyone has a price.' Marek nods, jotting down observations, while Xiao Fang dials a secure line, directing a transfer of funds to a key informant. The objective is to consolidate power by purchasing critical assets from rival factions; the result is a decisive shift of loyalty among underworld operatives, orchestrated through Xiao Fang's visible wealth and Marek's strategic insight.",

Originally, the plot focused on Marek outlining a spirit-breaking plan and Xiao Fang immediately signaling full commitment. In the dialogue, they instead prioritize gathering surveillance equipment, clarify their roles, and openly negotiate terms—including an even split and extraction conditions.
