        "sentence": "Xiao Fang steps off the train, her boots splashing into a shallow puddle as she surveys the bustling station with sharp eyes. She pulls a slim, high-end leather suitcase—its brand new sheen standing out in the crowd—behind her, signaling her newfound wealth. Marek Visser, leaning against a pillar and observing the flow of commuters, notices Xiao Fang's deliberate movements and expensive luggage. He approaches her, wiping rain from his glasses, and offers a folded city map in exchange for a briefcase of cash she nonchalantly reveals, testing his intentions. Xiao Fang hands him a business card with only a phone number and says, 'Meet me at the Oude Kerk at noon. Don't be late.' Marek nods, pocketing the card and glancing at the suitcase, weighing his options. Xiao Fang strides out into the rain, hailing a black Mercedes taxi with a crisp wave and stepping inside, leaving Marek to study the card and make his decision. The objective is to establish Xiao Fang's entry, display her resources, and initiate the first contact with Marek; as a result, a tentative alliance is set in motion.",

Marek skims the files, noting patterns in Hugo's behavior, and proposes a plan to exploit the target's superstitions.

The office hums with the quiet power of wealth—rare artwork lines the walls, and a bowl of fresh figs rests beside stacks of cash. Xiao Fang issues clear orders to Marek to devise a psychological campaign against Hugo de Groot, instructs Jasper to coordinate logistics for a high-profile infiltration, and signs off on a large wire transfer to secure a political bribe. Marek calmly details the spiritual vulnerabilities of their target, Jasper relays news of increased police activity, and Xiao Fang approves a new plan with a curt nod. Their actions are driven by their motivations: Xiao Fang's need to maintain dominance and wealth, Marek's pursuit of strategic influence, and Jasper's quest for underworld credibility. The scene establishes Xiao Fang's financial power and the team's readiness for their next move.",
