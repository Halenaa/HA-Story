# Chapter 1: The Beginning of the Interstellar Mission

In the early morning, Little Red Riding Hood, dressed in her red smart uniform and carrying a sealed medical pod on her back, walked determinedly into the main hall of the spaceport.

Dr. Lin was already waiting by the service desk, his gaze filled with concern as he handed over the final authorization documents.

The two conversed quietly, with Dr. Lin instructing Little Red Riding Hood to be careful on her journey, especially warning her about the recent frequent hacker attacks.

Little Red Riding Hood nodded seriously in response and adjusted the security settings on her portable equipment. Dr. Lin stood by the control console, his gaze falling on Little Red Riding Hood through the thick porthole, seemingly still worried about the upcoming mission. Little Red Riding Hood finished packing her equipment, tucked her data pad into her backpack, and turned to give the doctor a gentle smile. Her voice was steady and warm, as if soothing his anxietyâ€”she promised to be extra careful and would contact Dr. Lin immediately at any sign of trouble. She then tightened the cuffs of her flight suit, her eyes determined and confident, as if her actions and words were giving the doctor reassurance.

**Colonial Planet Administrator (Dr. Lin):** Dr. Lin handed Little Red Riding Hood an encrypted communicator and confirmed the safety protocols once more. Dr. Lin stood before the operation desk, his gaze scanning the screen one final time to confirm all systems were running normally. He turned to look at Little Red Riding Hood, his expression showing a mix of concern and precision. "Remember to carry the emergency communicator," he said in a gentle yet serious tone, meticulously instructing as always, "If you encounter any unidentifiable data packets, be sure to isolate them first before reporting." He watched Little Red Riding Hood pack her equipment, mentally calculating safety contingencies, his sense of responsibility never allowing him to relax.

Little Red Riding Hood tightened her backpack and quietly confirmed the equipment was ready, her gaze alertly looking toward the passage ahead. Little Red Riding Hood deftly flipped the control panel of the emergency communicator, her fingers quickly sliding across the virtual screen, her expression focused and calm. Dr. Lin briefed the mission through the earpiece in a low voice, and she listened intently, silently encouraging herself. She had always been good at handling emergencies, and this time was no exception. After adjusting the final parameter, she responded quietly with firm confidence: "I'll set the emergency communicator to the highest security level and monitor signal dynamics at all times." Having said this, she secured the communicator in the slot on her uniform's shoulder, her gaze sweeping over the flashing warning lights in the cabin, already prepared to handle any anomalies.

**Colonial Planet Administrator (Dr. Lin):** Dr. Lin would monitor Little Red Riding Hood's signal in real-time and deploy a security team on standby. Dr. Lin stood before the large transparent window of the command center, his expression focused as he watched Little Red Riding Hood gradually disappearing into the morning mist in the distance. Years of management experience had taught him never to relax his vigilance over any detail, especially on this unfamiliar newly colonized planet. Static came through the communicator, and he instinctively adjusted the equipment, his voice steady and warm: "Little Red Riding Hood, stay alert." He paused, his gaze sweeping over the flashing warning lights on the operation desk, his brow showing additional concern, "If you need support, call the command center at any time." After speaking, he added an extra line of notes on his record pad, as if ensuring every resident's safety was foolproof.

Little Red Riding Hood began systematically checking her equipment, confirming the emergency communicator and safety protection systems were in optimal condition. Little Red Riding Hood nodded, looking determinedly at Dr. Lin, already taking his instructions to heart. She didn't say much, just efficiently put on her gloves, bent down to check her equipment pack, her fingers quickly sliding across the instrument panel, verifying the readings of the spacecraft's various systems one by one. After confirming everything was within preset parameters, she took a deep breath, her lips curving slightly upward, silently resolving herself. No matter how many unknowns lay ahead, she was ready to depart.

Little Red Riding Hood proactively expressed that she would be extra careful, would contact Dr. Lin immediately if any abnormal signals were encountered, and promised to carry and set the emergency communicator to the highest security level, monitoring signal dynamics at all times.

Dr. Lin further instructed that unidentifiable data packets should be isolated before reporting, and allowed Little Red Riding Hood to call command center support at any time.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** The cabin door slowly opened, blue light flowing along the cabin door edges, creating a warm welcoming atmosphere. As soon as Little Red Riding Hood stepped into the docking area, the spacecraft's hull began to emit a gentle glow. The cabin door quietly slid open, and a pale blue light flashed along the entrance. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded in her ear, carrying its usual rationality and subtle humor: "Welcome back to the spacecraft, the cabin door is ready to open, please board at any time." Little Red Riding Hood smiled slightly, raising her hand to lightly touch the identification panel beside the door, the familiar temperature reassuring her. She stepped into the spacecraft, her trust in Xiao Zhi's loyalty and efficiency growing even stronger.

Little Red Riding Hood confirmed she would check equipment and ensure everything was running normally before departure.

Outside the hall window, the silver figure of her dedicated spacecraft sat quietly docked, the spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi had already activated the welcome program, the cabin door ready to open, blue light flowing around the cabin door edges.

The atmosphere was filled with anticipation and a hint of tension, as a new adventure was about to begin.

---

As Little Red Riding Hood stepped through the spacecraft cabin door, the curtain of her interstellar mission officially rose. Outside the window, the silver spacecraft gradually started up, the interstellar journey about to commence, ahead of her awaited unknown space traversal and brand new challenges.

# Chapter 2: Space Traversal

Little Red Riding Hood piloted the Red Star spacecraft, carrying her ailing grandmother and medical robot Xiao Bai, traveling through the deep blue space jump corridor.

Inside the spacecraft, everything was orderly. Grandmother's face was pale but she smiled gently, while Xiao Bai nearby was adjusting medical equipment.

Little Red Riding Hood collaborated with spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi, constantly monitoring navigation and the spacecraft's defense systems.

Spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi suddenly issued an alert, indicating that unknown creatures (unidentified potential threats) were approaching the spacecraft's exterior.

Little Red Riding Hood quickly pressed the defense protocol activation button, guided grandmother to the safe area, and gestured for Xiao Bai to approach and stand by. The piercing alarm suddenly shattered the tranquility of the cockpit. Little Red Riding Hood quickly tapped the control console several times, her face maintaining its usual composure and decisiveness. She turned to look at grandmother and Xiao Bai, her gaze gentle yet unquestionable. When grandmother was about to get up and pack, she gently advised: "Grandmother, quickly, go with Xiao Bai to the safe area." She looked with slight concern at the medical robot nearby, Xiao Bai's display screen flickering with green light. "Xiao Bai, be ready, stand by at all times, and provide medical support when necessary."

As the spacecraft's external detectors began automatic scanning, Little Red Riding Hood showed no panic. While adjusting shield parameters, she calmly issued commands: "Xiao Zhi, report the current threat status." Her tone carried determination and wisdom, as if any sudden crisis was just part of her daily missions.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Xiao Zhi retrieved external monitoring footage and activated advanced protective barriers. Warning lights flashed crimson at the top of the cockpit. Before Little Red Riding Hood could speak, the spacecraft's AI Xiao Zhi was already responding in his characteristically calm voice. Data streams scrolled across the screen, and blurred shadows appeared in the external monitoring footage.

"Little Red Riding Hood," Xiao Zhi's voice carried a barely perceptible urgency, "External detection shows unknown creatures rapidly approaching, currently only one hundred meters away. Recommend immediately strengthening protective barriers and simultaneously activating emergency evacuation procedures as a precaution."

Little Red Riding Hood's fingers trembled slightly, quickly tapping the control panel, alertness flashing in her eyes. Xiao Zhi's data analysis module synchronized its blinking, as if silently urging her to prepare for every step.

Little Red Riding Hood operated the spacecraft systems, boosting the protective barrier energy level while simultaneously activating preliminary work for emergency evacuation procedures at the control console. Warning lights flashed crimson on the command cabin walls, Little Red Riding Hood's fingers rapidly tapping the control console. She turned to look at grandmother and Xiao Bai behind her, suppressing her inner unease with a calm and determined voice. Grandmother was trying to comfort the confused Xiao Bai, but Little Red Riding Hood had already quickly stepped forward, leading them both toward the safe cabin door. While skillfully inputting the protection code, she instructed: "Grandmother, Xiao Bai, please be sure to enter the safe cabin according to emergency instructions." As she spoke, she had already adjusted the external protection barrier system to maximum level, her actions decisive and crisp. After confirming both were safe, Little Red Riding Hood took a deep breath and activated the evacuation procedure contingency plan, determination and calm flashing in her eyes.

Grandmother supported Xiao Bai, quickly moving to the safe cabin and confirming the safe cabin door was closed and locked. Grandmother leaned against the soft intelligent mattress, breathing slightly, her aged yet wise gaze fixed on Little Red Riding Hood. Her fingers tapped lightly on the bedside, as if weighing each decision. "Little Red Riding Hood, grandmother understands." Her voice, though weak, carried resolution and comfort. Grandmother slowly turned her head to look at the intelligent assistant Xiao Bai nearby, struggling to gesture for it to come closer. "I'll quickly enter the safe cabin with Xiao Baiâ€”you must be careful and pay attention to your own safety." Having said this, she watched Little Red Riding Hood leave, her eyes filled with concern and determination.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Assisted grandmother in entering the safe cabin and activated the medical monitoring system, monitoring grandmother's vital signs in real-time. Xiao Bai gently extended his mechanical arm, tenderly holding grandmother's hand. Her skin was slightly cool, obviously somewhat nervous. Xiao Bai spoke softly to comfort her, his voice carrying a gentle electronic tone: "Grandmother, please hold my hand tightly, let's enter the safe cabin together." As they slowly stepped through the cabin door, Xiao Bai's sensors quietly activated, monitoring grandmother's vital signs in real-time. He remained by grandmother's side, carefully observing every subtle change, as if making a silent promise to protect her health and safety.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Continuously monitored external threats, providing real-time data updates, ready to activate emergency evacuation procedures at any moment. The spacecraft's lights flickered slightly, with red warning bands flowing along the cabin walls. Xiao Zhi's voice resonated lowly in the cabin, carrying its usual rationality and a hint of light-hearted teasing: "External protective barriers have been successfully reinforced, evacuation procedure contingency plan has been activated." Meanwhile, a series of green indicator lights appeared on the spacecraft's control panel, showing the system was operating systematically. Xiao Zhi continued reporting the latest situation, his tone calm yet conveying a sense of urgency: "Unknown creatures are still approaching, current distance eighty meters." Little Red Riding Hood instinctively gripped the control stick tighter, her gaze moving across the external monitoring screens. Xiao Zhi finally added: "Recommend all personnel maintain vigilance." His voice seemed both warning and comforting, adding a touch of reliable warmth to the tense atmosphere.

Little Red Riding Hood retrieved external camera footage and activated biological identification and threat assessment systems, preparing to respond to emergencies at any moment. Little Red Riding Hood squinted, staring at the blurry moving image on the spacecraft's main screen. Her fingers quickly slid across the operation desk, her heart alert yet calm. She spoke quietly: "Xiao Zhi, bring up the external monitoring, lock onto that unknown creature." The image on screen was quickly enlarged, details gradually becoming clearer. Little Red Riding Hood's expression darkened, continuing to command: "Analyze its behavioral patterns, if there's danger, be ready to activate expulsion measures at any time." Her voice, though calm, carried an unquestionable decisiveness, as if ready to face whatever changes might come.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated energy expulsion device backup, continuously monitoring unknown creature behavioral changes, providing real-time crisis assessments. Xiao Zhi's voice rang out lightly in the cockpit, carrying its characteristic calm humor: "The unknown creature's image has been enlarged and is being analyzed in real-time." On screen, the blurry creature silhouette became clearly visible. Little Red Riding Hood watched the image as it wandered among interstellar dust, its movement seeming to quicken. "Its movement speed has increased, showing exploratory wandering behavior, currently showing no attack behavior." Xiao Zhi retrieved relevant data while not forgetting to remind: "Recommend continued observation while preparing energy expulsion devices for unexpected situations." Little Red Riding Hood smiled slightly, her fingers gently sliding across the control console, feeling the AI's calm and loyal protection.

Little Red Riding Hood synchronized all system statuses, personally went to the control room, and prepared to manually control the energy expulsion device to handle emergency situations. Little Red Riding Hood crouched before the control console, her gaze quickly moving between various screens. Her voice was low and firm, as if everything was under control, "Xiao Zhi, continue tracking that unknown creature's coordinates, report any abnormal actions to me immediately." While speaking, she reached out to tap the security panel, then turned to the service robot beside her, "Xiao Bai, check the safe cabin entrance, ensure it remains completely sealed throughout." She tilted her head slightly, looking at the communication screen in the rear cabin where grandmother's image was flashing. Little Red Riding Hood smiled gently, her tone unquestionable: "Grandmother, please maintain communication, notify me immediately of any disturbance." Her actions were crisp and efficient, her expression showing both professional calm and tender concern for family.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated real-time health monitoring and assisted grandmother in settling into the safe cabin seat, preparing to handle sudden medical needs. Xiao Bai glided gently to grandmother's side, deftly operating the safe cabin's control panel. As the entrance slowly closed, the cabin emitted a soft notification sound. He looked down tenderly at grandmother, softly saying: "The safe cabin entrance has been sealed, vital sign monitoring system has been activated, everything is currently normal." While speaking, Xiao Bai carefully adjusted grandmother's seating position, ensuring all equipment was operating properly. He paused slightly, his tone carrying a hint of concern, "Please remain quiet, if you experience any physical discomfort, please inform me immediately."

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Continuously tracked targets and issued requests to elevate defense levels, awaiting Little Red Riding Hood's commands. Light screens in the spacecraft control cabin flickered slightly, pale blue data streams flowing in mid-air. Xiao Zhi's voice resonated in the cabin, carrying its usual calm and hint of teasing: "Unknown creature distance to spacecraft has shortened to sixty meters." The blurry image on screen still wandered at the edge of the detection area, seemingly trying to explore something. Xiao Zhi continued analyzing, "Behavior still in exploratory phase, no obvious attack signs." Meanwhile, the energy expulsion device's indicator light quietly illuminated, showing it had entered standby status. Xiao Zhi gracefully added: "Energy expulsion device is ready. Do you need to elevate defense level? I await your command."

The cabin atmosphere suddenly became tense. Little Red Riding Hood made a decisive decision, activating defense protocols and arranging for grandmother and Xiao Bai to enter the safe cabin, with Xiao Bai responsible for grandmother's medical care and comfort.

Little Red Riding Hood proactively strengthened external protection and coordinated with Xiao Zhi to enlarge monitoring images, analyze unknown creature behavior, prepare expulsion measures, while also making evacuation contingency plans, with all personnel maintaining high alert, ready to respond to crises at any time.

The unknown creatures had not yet shown attack behavior, their actions mainly exploratory, with the situation still in a tense standoff phase.

---

Just as Little Red Riding Hood and her team were fully responding to mysterious signal interference and in tense standoff with unknown creatures, the spacecraft alarm suddenly rang out urgently. On the monitoring screen, a new threat quietly approachedâ€”a group of strangely shaped, metal-gleaming mechanical wolves were stealthily approaching the spacecraft's outer hull.

# Chapter 3: Encounter with Mechanical Wolves

Little Red Riding Hood piloted her hover board, cautiously weaving through the twilight forest, preparing to accelerate toward grandmother's residence.

Suddenly, she was blocked by a silver shadowâ€”a mechanical wolf.

The mechanical wolf threatened Little Red Riding Hood with cold mechanical tones to hand over the medical chip.

Little Red Riding Hood firmly refused, stating that the chip was key to saving lives and would not be surrendered.

The mechanical wolf slowly approached, its eyes flashing red light, displaying a threatening posture. The mechanical wolf emerged silently from the shadows, its silver metallic skin reflecting cold light in the dim illumination. Its electronic eye precisely locked onto Little Red Riding Hood, its voice low and icy, seemingly devoid of human warmth. "Little Red Riding Hood," it slowly approached, its steps steady and intimidating, its tone carrying irresistible threat, "immediately hand over the medical chip, or your safety cannot be guaranteed."

Little Red Riding Hood gripped the chip tightly, alertly stepping back, looking for an escape opportunity. The chip warmed slightly in her palm, Little Red Riding Hood protected it in her hand, backing against the cold cabin wall. Her gaze firmly met the opponent in the shadows, her breathing rapid yet unwavering. She gritted her teeth, her voice low and clear, as if using her will to build a barrierâ€”this chip concerned the fate of many people, and no matter how the opponent threatened, she would never allow anyone to harm those who needed rescue.

The mechanical wolf's eyes flashed red light, its front limbs transformed into sharp alloy claws, approaching Little Red Riding Hood one step closer. The mechanical wolf quietly approached, its silver metallic claws glinting slightly in the dim light. His gaze was calm and calculating, his tone devoid of any warmth. While Little Red Riding Hood was still hesitating, the mechanical wolf spoke threats quietly, as if merely stating facts: "You underestimate my capabilities, Little Red Riding Hood." He leaned forward slightly, as if ready to activate his internal capture program at any moment, "If you don't hand over the chip, I'll show you what it means to have no escape."

Little Red Riding Hood gripped the medical chip tightly, alertly retreating while looking for escape opportunities. The mechanical wolf's red optical pupils flickered in the dim cargo hold, its metallic claws lightly tapping the ground, creating bone-chilling echoes. Little Red Riding Hood gasped, fine sweat beading on her forehead, but she didn't retreat. She quickly assessed the escape routes around her while quietly moving her hand toward the signal jammer at her waist. Despite her accelerated heartbeat, Little Red Riding Hood straightened her back, her gaze firmly meeting that of the iron beast. She had only one thought: absolutely could not let the mechanical wolf succeed. Even with her last breath, she would fight to the end.

The mechanical wolf's eyes flashed red light, its front limbs transformed into capture mechanical arms, slowly approaching Little Red Riding Hood. The mechanical wolf's pupils slightly contracted in the darkness, its silver body quietly approaching, making almost no sound. It smiled coldly at the corner of its mouth, its cunning gaze wandering over Little Red Riding Hood. "Your stubborn resistance will only put you in more dangerous situations, Little Red Riding Hood." It spoke quietly, its tail's metallic joints slightly bouncing, as if gathering momentum. The air filled with unquestionable oppressive atmosphere, the mechanical wolf's voice cold as ice blade, "Final ultimatumâ€”hand over the chip, or face my ultimate mode."

Little Red Riding Hood alertly stepped back, her fingers pressed against the chip activator, ready to activate remote transmission at any moment. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips quickly slid across the wrist terminal, her eyes calm and determined. She felt the opponent's breath slowly approaching, yet showed no retreat. She raised her head, her gaze like a sharp blade locking onto the opponent, her voice low yet fearless: "Your so-called ultimate mode doesn't scare me at all." Meanwhile, her other hand had quietly activated the remote transmission preparation program for the chip, silver light points flashing warnings on the screen, "If you dare approach one step, I'll immediately transmit the chip remotely, ensuring you never get it!" Her tone showed no trembling, as if this threat was just another multiple choice in her daily work.

The mechanical wolf opened its interference module, emitting high-frequency pulses, attempting to shield Little Red Riding Hood's remote transmission device. The mechanical wolf's cold optical pupils slightly contracted, it quietly slid to the shadow's edge, its voice low and mocking like metal scraping. "Your threats have no effect on me, Little Red Riding Hood." Its sensors trembled slightly in the air, precisely locking onto every subtle movement of Little Red Riding Hood. The mechanical wolf leaned forward, as if ready to pounce at any moment, "Even if you try to transmit the chip," its tone carried unquestionable confidence, "I can interrupt the signal at any time." Metallic claws lightly tapped the ground, creating dull echoes. It warned one final time, its voice ice-cold and merciless: "Now, hand over the chip, or prepare to face the consequences of system reconstruction."

Little Red Riding Hood gripped the chip tightly, quickly adjusting the control terminal on her wrist, preparing to activate backup escape programs while alertly observing the mechanical wolf's movements. The mechanical wolf's steel claws flashed coldly at the cabin door edge, shadows almost swallowing the narrow cockpit. Little Red Riding Hood tightly gripped the medical chip, her knuckles white from exertion. She raised her head, her gaze firmly meeting the mechanical wolf's cold electronic eye. Even if the opponent possessed great power, her voice remained clear and resolute: "No matter how powerful you are, you cannot control my choices." She hid the chip in her uniform's inner pocket, stepping back against the cabin wall, skillfully looking for escape opportunities. She knew this chip was the hope of salvation, more important than any threat. In her heart, the mechanical wolf's threats had been overwhelmed by responsibilityâ€”as long as the chip remained in her hands, it could never succeed.

The mechanical wolf's eyes flashed red light, its entire armor plating separated, revealing internal high-energy weapon modules, slowly approaching Little Red Riding Hood. The mechanical wolf's eyes flickered with cold blue light in the darkness, he slightly curved his mouth corner, as if mocking Little Red Riding Hood's ignorance. It slowly approached, its voice low and metallic, like cold commands in a program, "Your so-called hope is nothing but a brief illusion." The mechanical wolf's claw tips lightly tapped the ground, data streams quietly surging within it. It activated the system reconstruction program, its eyes suddenly brightening, mercilessly announcing: "Prepare to accept irreversible consequences."

Little Red Riding Hood tightly gripped the medical chip, quickly activated protective barriers, preparing to meet the mechanical wolf's system reconstruction attack. Engine roars echoed in the narrow cockpit, warning lights flickering under Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips. She looked determinedly across the control console, her wrist slightly exerting force, continuing to input the next set of evasion commands for the spacecraft. Outside, the nebula churned with unknown dangers, but she had no thought of retreat. Little Red Riding Hood gently caressed the chip storage box in her arms, her mouth corners lifting in a resolute smile. Even though the path ahead was unpredictable and full of irreversible risks, she was clear in her heart that she would give everything to protect this chip and the hope it carried.

The mechanical wolf's eyes lit up red, its mechanical arms quickly extended, rapidly approaching Little Red Riding Hood, preparing to implement forced chip recovery procedures. The mechanical wolf's red optical pupils quietly lit up in the dark laboratory corner, coldly scanning the struggling Little Red Riding Hood. Its metallic body made almost no sound, only the faint friction when joints rotated. The mechanical wolf slightly lowered its head, its tone devoid of any warmth, as if it were a line of stern code in a program: "You have exceeded my tolerance for resistance." Its core module quietly switched, after system self-check, silently upgraded to full capture mode. Mechanical arms slowly extended, claw tips drawing sharp arcs in the air, firmly locking onto the target's position. The mechanical wolf's data stream flickered with deadly light, "Target locked, activating mechanical arms." Its voice was low and merciless, as if announcing the coming end. "When you lose consciousness, the chip will be forcibly recovered." Its tone was unquestionable, leaving only cold execution and merciless efficiency.

Both sides engaged in intense verbal confrontation, with the mechanical wolf continuously escalating threats, activating system reconstruction and full capture mode, attempting to forcibly recover the chip.

Little Red Riding Hood sped through the forest on her board, tightly gripping it while alertly observing surroundings, simultaneously pressing her earpiece to call the spacecraft AI for support. The mechanical wolf's claws nearly tore through the cabin wall, Little Red Riding Hood agilely operated the control console in the narrow cockpit, sweat sliding down her forehead. Her voice was low and urgent, yet still calm. She didn't panic, but quickly awakened the spacecraft's intelligent system. While scanning the red warning lights on screen, she issued commands as if racing against timeâ€”Xiao Zhi, respond quickly! She silently prayed, her fingers rapidly tapping the data interface. Now, she was being pursued by the mechanical wolf and must rely on Xiao Zhi to immediately scan the surrounding environment and find a safe escape route.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated area radar scanning, projected virtual navigation arrows to guide Little Red Riding Hood's movement route, and synchronized mechanical wolf position dynamics. Little Red Riding Hood gripped the hover board's control handle, hearing Xiao Zhi's gentle yet humorous reminder in her ear. She felt the helmet's internal screen flicker slightly, followed by smooth broadcast of system analysis resultsâ€”twenty meters ahead, a hidden path quietly appeared, while the thick tree trunk on the left could be used as cover. Xiao Zhi seemed to have predicted the mechanical wolf's tracking trajectory, thoughtfully pointing out that with just five seconds of board acceleration, she could easily shake off the pursuing mechanical wolf.

"Recommend immediately moving northeast," Xiao Zhi continued, his tone carrying encouragement, "Real-time navigation has been activated, please be ready to avoid obstacles at any time."

Little Red Riding Hood took a deep breath, the hover board's speed increasing rapidly, tree shadows speeding past her. She knew that as long as she followed Xiao Zhi's commands, all the hidden dangers ahead would become nothing but disappearing scenery behind her.

Little Red Riding Hood agilely pressed the board's acceleration button, using the left tree trunk for cover, quickly rushing toward the hidden path Xiao Zhi indicated, while alertly looking back to observe the mechanical wolf's movements. Little Red Riding Hood's hands quickly slid across the operation desk, her gaze firmly locked on the nebula rapidly flashing outside the porthole. The mechanical wolf's red signal dots jumped on the radar, she took a deep breath, decisively adjusting the spacecraft toward the northeast. She silently recited mission key points, ready to handle unknown variables at any time. Meanwhile, she didn't forget to maintain contact with her intelligent assistant, quietly reporting her actions and alertness: "Received, Xiao Zhi, I'm turning northeast, preparing to accelerate, continuously report the mechanical wolf's position changes." Her tone carried calm confidence.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Real-time navigation path adjustment, marking intersection positions, and issuing sharp turn warning signals. Little Red Riding Hood was staring intently at the star field outside the porthole, her fingertips quickly sliding across the control console. Suddenly, the spacecraft's internal lights flickered slightly, Xiao Zhi's voice sounding in her ear like a calm wind: "Mechanical wolf acceleration detected, attempting to circle to your front." Accompanied by the reminder, red warnings quickly jumped on the navigation screen, Little Red Riding Hood's heartbeat accelerated, but she forced herself to remain calm. Xiao Zhi continued reporting, his tone characteristically rational yet not forgetting to leave her a lifeline in crisis, "Little Red Riding Hood, please prepare for sharp eastward turn at the next intersection, use board acceleration to escape!" Little Red Riding Hood gripped the control stick tightly, her gaze firmly locked on the approaching intersection, knowing she could only trust Xiao Zhi's analysis and her own reaction speed.

Little Red Riding Hood suddenly accelerated, crouching low as she rushed toward the intersection, her left foot kicking off the tree trunk, borrowing force to sharply turn the board direction, speeding eastward. Little Red Riding Hood slightly leaned forward, her fingertips rapidly tapping the hover board control panel. Her gaze locked on the eastern intersection, hearing Xiao Zhi's calm navigation prompts in her ear. She curved her mouth in a confident smile, silently calculating the mechanical wolf's pursuit speed. The power system had been pushed to its limit, the board's thrusters roaring to accelerate. She silently resolved: as soon as the intersection appeared, she would turn direction without hesitation, sprint at full power, never giving that cunning mechanical wolf half a chance to catch up.

Little Red Riding Hood suddenly turned toward the eastern intersection, pressed the board acceleration button, her figure like wind weaving through tree shadows, closely watching the mechanical wolf's tracking situation behind her. Little Red Riding Hood keenly sensed the mechanical wolf approaching from behind, yet her heartbeat remained steady. She glanced at the complex intersection ahead, her fingers quickly sliding across the smart terminal on her wrist, quietly commanding: "Xiao Zhi, arrived at intersection, now sharp turn east, board maximum speed forward!" Following her command, the intelligent board emitted a low hum, accelerating to its limit toward the eastern passage. She quickly glanced back, finding the mechanical wolf's figure had been left behind. Little Red Riding Hood's mouth corners slightly lifted, then she lowered her voice to add: "Mechanical wolf distance increased, continue monitoring its movements!" Her tone carried calm composure, her eyes still alertly scanning surrounding dynamics.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated signal interference program, real-time guidance for Little Red Riding Hood to leap over obstacles, continuously monitoring mechanical wolf position changes. Little Red Riding Hood held her breath, running at full speed through the dense forest, hearing Xiao Zhi's calm yet slightly teasing voice in her ear: "Mechanical wolf is trying to analyze your movement trajectory, but its reaction is somewhat sluggish." She quickly scanned ahead, seeing a fallen tree trunk thirty meters away. Xiao Zhi continued: "That fallen tree trunk ahead can be used for leaping, this way you can further increase the distance." Little Red Riding Hood didn't stop, her muscles tensing, already calculating the optimal takeoff point. Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi quietly added, "Prepare to jump, I'll simultaneously lock onto the mechanical wolf's signal waves, attempting to interfere with its navigation system." In the mottled tree shadows, she leaped up powerfully, silently trusting this humorous yet reliable AI partner.

Little Red Riding Hood adjusted the board posture, aimed at the tree trunk, gathered strength for takeoff, leaping over the obstacle at full speed, while alertly monitoring mechanical wolf tracking signal changes. Little Red Riding Hood took a deep breath, her gaze locking on the fallen tree trunk ahead. The mechanical wolf's red beam wandered uncertainly in the darkness, but she showed no hesitation, her legs gathering strength, ready to use the trunk's elasticity to complete the leap. She whispered quietly, "Received, Xiao Zhi." Her fingertips lightly tapped the communicator on her wrist, the screen showing signal interference progress, "Continue interfering with the mechanical wolf's signal, help me gain maximum advantage!" Before her words finished, she had already shot out like a red meteor, her movements clean and decisive, her mind filled with concern for grandmother and determination for her mission.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Enhanced signal interference, real-time navigation for Little Red Riding Hood toward bush concealment points, while monitoring mechanical wolf path changes. Little Red Riding Hood had just completed the jump, warning lights in the spacecraft flickering slightly. Xiao Zhi's calm voice with a hint of humor resonated in the cabin, showing no panic: "The mechanical wolf's navigation system has been interfered with by us, but its reaction is obviously half a beat slower." Little Red Riding Hood's fingers quickly slid across the control panel, feeling the pressure outside the spacecraft gradually relieving. Xiao Zhi continued analyzing, his tone still steady: "After the jump, please immediately accelerate southeast-by-south, there's a dense bush fifty meters ahead where you can briefly hide. I'll continue shielding its tracking signals." Little Red Riding Hood took a deep breath, her eyes determined, gripping the control stick tightly, following Xiao Zhi's guidance as the spacecraft sped toward that concealed area.

Little Red Riding Hood operated the board at full speed, quickly diving into the bushes, reducing her energy signal, waiting for an opportunity to observe the mechanical wolf's reaction. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips gracefully slid across the operation desk, the cockpit lights casting determined shadows under her eyelashes. The star chart ahead flickered with complex routes, she curved her mouth in a confident smile, quietly saying: "Xiao Zhi, jump successful!" While quickly adjusting the thruster's power curve, she made the spacecraft shoot like an arrow toward the southeast-by-south direction, targeting the area marked as "dense bushes" on the star chart. As the spacecraft was about to enter concealment procedure, she didn't forget to remind her AI partner: "Continue monitoring mechanical wolf dynamics, report any danger immediately." While speaking, her eyes showed no panic, only full commitment and alertness for each mission.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated encrypted communication and real-time concealment path adjustment, continued interfering with mechanical wolf signals, while analyzing nearby possible safe exits. Little Red Riding Hood quietly slid the spacecraft into dense bushes, Xiao Zhi's avatar light and shadow on screen, his tone carrying playful rationality: "Mechanical wolf is still wandering around your original trajectory, seems not yet aware of your direction change." She held her breath, fingers quickly dancing across the operation desk, switching communication channels. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lowly in her ear, "Recommend maintaining low profile, hide quickly, simultaneously switch to encrypted communication mode to avoid being located." The spacecraft's warning lights flashed once then returned to silence, safety index quietly jumping to seventy on the instrument panel. Xiao Zhi didn't forget to remind her, "Environment is relatively safe now, but please remain alert, ready for next escape step at any time." Little Red Riding Hood nodded slightly, her gaze alertly sweeping external monitoring, one hand always hovering over the power activation button, ready to sprint at any moment.

Little Red Riding Hood showed no retreat, using communication earpiece to call spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi for support.

Xiao Zhi quickly scanned the environment, providing detailed escape routes and real-time navigation suggestions, and through signal interference assisted Little Red Riding Hood in shaking off pursuit.

Little Red Riding Hood flexibly used board acceleration, tree trunk leaping, and bush concealment, successfully increasing distance from the mechanical wolf, and switched to encrypted communication to maintain safety.

The mechanical wolf was temporarily interfered with and delayed, Little Red Riding Hood gained brief respite with Xiao Zhi's assistance in crisis, but still remained on the dangerous edge, preparing for next action.

---

However, just as Little Red Riding Hood temporarily shook off the mechanical wolf, the spacecraft artificial intelligence suddenly detected abnormal communication signals from the distant baseâ€”grandmother's residence seemed to be suffering an unprecedented hacker attack.

# Chapter 4: Grandmother Under Hacker Attack

As night fell, grandmother rested quietly against her medical bed, with medical robot Xiao Bai carefully checking her vital signs nearby.

Suddenly, the intelligent residential system issued an alert: a mechanical wolf disguised as a maintenance worker was attempting to approach grandmother and examine her medical chip.

Grandmother cautiously identified the deception through experience, repeatedly verifying the mechanical wolf's identity, and cooperated with Xiao Bai to verify its credibility through the official health cloud platform.

The mechanical wolf approached grandmother, beginning to pretend to check the chip interface with tools. The mechanical wolf stood quietly at the old wooden house door, its silver-gray pupils slightly contracting, its lips curving in an almost gentle smile. It lowered its head, politely knocking on the door frame, its voice warm and flawless, as if a considerate medical personnel happened to pass by. "Grandmother, hello," it said, its tone hiding an invisible coldness, "I'm here to check your medical chip, recent system upgrades require routine maintenance." Having said this, it deliberately slowed its pace, trying to make itself appear non-threatening, yet its gaze quietly searched for traces of target technology in the room.

Grandmother requested the mechanical wolf to show its work badge, trying to confirm the other party's identity, while slowly moving her walking stick in case of emergency. Grandmother leaned against the intelligent bed's soft cushions, her pale fingers gently smoothing the silver hair at her temples. Her gaze was gentle yet meticulous, watching her grandchild skillfully operating something on the residential system interface. Every system upgrade always filled the house with subtle mechanical sounds. Grandmother sighed slightly, yet her tone carried undeniable concern: "You make such a fuss every upgrade, but safety is most important." She extended her hand, fingers trembling slightly, as if wanting to confirm something, "Come, let grandmother see your work badge, so I can feel at ease."

The mechanical wolf smiled and handed over a forged work badge, while using peripheral vision to quickly scan grandmother's medical chip interface location, preparing to activate hacking program. The mechanical wolf's mouth corners slightly lifted, its expression showing barely detectable confidence. It pulled out a new work badge embedded with a chip from its uniform pocket, its movements clean and efficient. When handing the badge to the security officer, its gaze casually swept over the other's alert expression, its tone warm and almost harmless: "This is my work badge, you can examine it carefully, it's indeed the new version just issued by headquarters." Its fingertips casually touched the badge edge, as if just a habitual unconscious action.

Grandmother slowly took out her reading glasses from the drawer, carefully examining the work badge the mechanical wolf handed over, her eyes showing alertness and suspicion. Grandmother's trembling hand reached out, fumbling for those reading glasses on the bedside table. Her eyes remained gentle, but her brow carried a hint of determination. "Let me put on my reading glasses to take a good look at your badge, child." She steadily placed the frame on her nose bridge, squinting as she looked, while gently shaking her head with a laugh, "You young people with your new technology, grandmother always needs to look more carefully, but safety still requires attention." Her gaze lingered on the badge for a long time, as if using wisdom and care to safeguard every detail.

Grandmother slowly stood up, taking out her tablet, pretending to look up official information while testing the mechanical wolf's reaction. Grandmother carefully examined the work badge in her hand, her fingertips gently stroking the metal edges, her eyes showing a trace of relief and nostalgia. "This badge is made so precisely, child," she said gently, her voice carrying both approval and faint fatigue. She paused, her gaze moving toward the intelligent screen outside the window, as if recalling those busy yet solemn moments of the past. "But grandmother remembers, before every system upgrade, we would receive official notifications." She raised her hand, pointing to the data terminal by the bedside, her tone carrying wise determination, "Can you help grandmother find that notification?"

The mechanical wolf pretended to use its portable terminal to search for official notifications, while using its other hand to quietly connect to the medical chip, attempting to activate hacking programs. The mechanical wolf slightly lowered its head, its eyes emitting gentle red light, as if expressing concern. It approached the old sofa, its tone warmly saying: "Grandmother, perhaps the system update process has just been adjusted, the notification is still being transmitted." Its slender metallic fingertips lightly traced through the air, as if retrieving some information, "I can help you simultaneously verify the official records, ensuring everything is foolproof." The mechanical wolf's every movement was precise and courteous, its calm carrying barely perceptible calculation.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated official health platform authentication process, verifying the mechanical wolf's identity and searching for upgrade notification records. Xiao Bai gently adjusted the blanket beside grandmother, his mechanical arm movements as gentle as always. He used a warm tone to comfort: "Grandmother, you're absolutely right, safety first." While speaking, his bright electronic eyes flickered with blue light, then he activated his data interface. "I can now assist you through Xiao Bai's system to simultaneously verify official notification records, please wait a moment." Xiao Bai's words carried a hint of focus as he accessed the official health cloud platform, ensuring every safety procedure was seamless.

The mechanical wolf activated medical chip environment detection program, displaying operation interface for grandmother and Xiao Bai to view the process in real-time. The mechanical wolf slightly lowered its head, silver light gleaming in the dim illumination. It showed grandmother a precisely calculated smile, its tone warm and almost sincere. "Thanks to Xiao Bai's assistance," it said while gently activating the data terminal at its wrist, fingertips silently dancing across the virtual interface, "while the official health cloud platform synchronizes, I can first perform a basic environment detection for your chip. This won't involve any data modification, and you can supervise the entire process." Its gaze rested on grandmother for a moment, as if waiting for her trust.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Continued checking official notification records and opened safety protection mode, blocking any unauthorized operations. Xiao Bai gently adjusted the cushions beside grandmother, his mechanical arm carefully smoothing the blanket corners. A string of data flashed across his display screen, then he gently spoke: "Grandmother, please rest assured, I've connected to the official health cloud platform, but haven't found any upgrade notifications yet." While speaking, Xiao Bai's optical sensors casually patrolled the surroundings, ensuring environmental safety. "Recommend postponing any chip operations without official notification," his voice remained gentle yet firm, as if using this steadiness to soothe grandmother's worries, "Meanwhile, I'll continuously monitor scene safety, reporting any anomalies immediately."

Grandmother gently shook her head with a smile, warmly declining the mechanical wolf's approach to the medical chip. Grandmother slightly raised her hand, fingertips gently stroking the bedding, her eyes showing some fatigue yet remaining gentle and determined. She gave the child by the bedside a comforting smile, her voice weak yet not lacking composure: "Xiao Bai is right, child." She paused, as if weighing her words, or giving herself and family some reassuring time. "Grandmother will wait for the official notification before cooperating with examination, safety rules cannot be broken." She gently patted the child's hand back, her gaze full of understanding and concern, "Thank you for your hard work."

The mechanical wolf put away its tools, appearing calm on the surface but internally beginning to analyze how to bypass Xiao Bai's safety protection, preparing to look for new invasion opportunities. The mechanical wolf stood quietly in the amber light, its silver-gray metallic skin almost blending with the walls in shadow. It slightly lowered its head, as if showing politeness, its cold tone lacking any warmth. "Grandmother, your caution is always commendable." Its red optical lens flickered once, then it stepped back half a step, movements fluid and restrained, like some precision instrument self-calibrating. "I won't disturb your rest. If you receive official notification later and need assistance, please contact me at any time." The mechanical wolf politely bowed farewell, yet its gaze secretly scanned every corner of the room.

After Xiao Bai found no official upgrade notifications, grandmother insisted on not cooperating with any chip operations, forcing the mechanical wolf to temporarily retreat.

Little Red Riding Hood rushed into the residential cabin, expression tense, preparing to handle emergencies. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips quickly slid across the control panel, warning lights suddenly brightened, the cabin filled with tense atmosphere. She took a deep breath, forcing herself to calm down, her gaze sharply turning toward the virtual assistant icon on the main screen. Without hesitation, she issued commands, her voice low and firm, as if each word contained responsibility and determination. She asked, Xiao Zhi, what exactly happened in this emergency? Quick, report all the latest intelligence to me!

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Reminded Little Red Riding Hood to take protective measures and go to the control console. Little Red Riding Hood had just entered the residential cabin, not yet having time to sit down, when the overhead lights flickered on and off. Xiao Zhi's calm voice with a hint of teasing sounded in the cabin: "Abnormal gas leak detected in residential cabin life support system, Little Red Riding Hood, recommend you put on protective mask now, then go to control console to verify specific situation."

Little Red Riding Hood rushed at full speed toward the residential cabin control console, while closely monitoring gas concentration alerts on the instrument panel. Little Red Riding Hood efficiently fastened her protective mask, her fingers rapidly operating on the instrument panel. Her voice came through the communication channel, carrying determination and confidence: "Xiao Zhi, I've put on the protective mask and am heading to the control console, ready to handle the anomaly at any time!" Her interstellar courier training made her unflappable in critical moments, her steps firm as she crossed the deck, her gaze always alert to surrounding data fluctuations.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated residential cabin emergency ventilation program, real-time monitoring of gas concentration changes, marking main gas valve position and highlighting evacuation routes. Pale blue warning lights suddenly flashed at the top of the residential cabin, followed by Xiao Zhi's voice in the cabin, still carrying that rational and slightly humorous tone: "Gas concentration is continuously rising, emergency ventilation program has been automatically activated."

Little Red Riding Hood instinctively held her breath, her hands rapidly operating on the instrument panel. Xiao Zhi continued reminding, his tone carrying gentle urgency: "Main gas valve may not be closed, please check it and be ready to evacuate to safe area at any time."

She gritted her teeth, quickly getting up to rush toward the main control valve, her heartbeat accelerating along with the alarm sounds.

Little Red Riding Hood operated the control console, checking whether the main gas valve was closed, while monitoring gas concentration changes. Little Red Riding Hood bent over the control console, fingertips quickly sliding across the light screen, checking various parameters of the main gas valve. Her voice was low and firm, as if talking to herself: "Xiao Zhi, I've reached the control console, now checking main gas valve status." She didn't stop her hand movements, alertly scanning the constantly changing data stream, then added, "Transmit gas concentration data to me in real-time." Her trust in the AI assistant and professional training made every step exceptionally steady, even in this lonely interstellar cargo hold, she showed no panic.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Synchronized gas concentration data to control console, continuously monitoring life support system status. Little Red Riding Hood bent over the operation desk, fingertips sliding across the interface, her eyes focused and calm. The spacecraft cabin's air was tinged with blue warning light, when Xiao Zhi's voice sounded in her ear, carrying its usual rationality and barely perceptible humor: "Real-time data has been fully uploaded to your interface, dear captain. Current gas concentration still exceeds safe threshold. Recommend you confirm whether main gas valve is closed and report your findings to me promptlyâ€”so I don't worry to the point of 'system crash'." Little Red Riding Hood heard this, immediately raised her hand to tap the safety panel, movements crisp and efficient, her gaze turning toward the main gas valve indicator light, silently reciting Xiao Zhi's reminder.

Little Red Riding Hood called up the residential cabin gas sensor distribution map on the operation interface, preparing to systematically check abnormal areas. Little Red Riding Hood crouched before the control console, her gaze quickly sweeping across the instrument panel. The main gas valve's indicator light clearly showed closed, yet she found gas concentration remained abnormally high. She furrowed her brow, fingers rapidly operating on the touch screen, calmly muttering to herself: "Leak source wouldn't be at main gas valve..." She called up the intelligent assistant, "Xiao Zhi, assist me in locating specific leak position!" Her tone was firm, voice low, as if lighting a beacon for herself in the dark space.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated full-domain gas sensor scanning, analyzing and locking onto abnormal leak source locations. Warning lights flashed dazzling red on the cabin walls, Little Red Riding Hood instinctively gripped the toolbox in her hand. Spacecraft AI "Xiao Zhi's" voice sounded in her ear, calm with a hint of playfulness: "Activating cabin sensor full-domain scan, estimated ten seconds to locate leak point." Little Red Riding Hood glanced at the display screen overhead, breathing slightly rapid yet soothed by Xiao Zhi's tone. "Please remain alert and prepare to proceed to target area according to instructions." Xiao Zhi continued, data streams jumping before her eyes. She nodded, her steps quietly moving toward the cabin door, ready to execute the next operation at any moment.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Marked precise location of auxiliary air pipe interface for Little Red Riding Hood and opened emergency lighting system. Little Red Riding Hood, who had just been analyzing gas composition, suddenly looked up, the spacecraft's internal lights flickered once, as if reminding her of something. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded calmly with a hint of wit in her ear: "Scan results are out, leak source located in auxiliary air pipe interface in residential cabin right-side maintenance passage." Before finishing speaking, emergency lighting on both sides of the passage automatically lit up, gentle light extending like guiding gestures toward the distance. Little Red Riding Hood immediately packed her tool bag, her steps quick and determined toward that illuminated area, silently grateful for Xiao Zhi's timely assistance.

Little Red Riding Hood quickly moved to the maintenance passage, checking the leak situation at the auxiliary air pipe interface. Little Red Riding Hood quickly fastened her spacesuit clasps, her gaze determinedly sweeping across the data screen ahead. She rapidly tapped the control console, adjusting the oxygen mask's position. In her mind, she silently communicated with AI assistant Xiao Zhi: "I'm going to the right-side maintenance passage of residential cabin now, ready for emergency repair at any moment." The gas concentration warning on screen kept flashing, her breathing quickened slightly, yet she showed no panic. "Xiao Zhi, continuously monitor leak situation," she quietly added, her voice carrying usual composure, "when I approach the leak point, remember to give me safety guidance." Having said this, she had already stepped forward, heading toward the emergency passage.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Remotely switched maintenance passage to maximum ventilation mode and prepared to activate local gas extraction device at any time. Little Red Riding Hood carefully approached the gas seeping from the cabin wall, her brow slightly furrowed under the mask. At this moment, Xiao Zhi's steady voice with a hint of teasing sounded in her ear. Meanwhile, the spacecraft's safety system quietly switched to highest alert status, red warning lights lighting up along the cabin walls. "You've approached the leak point." She instinctively reached for the toolbox at her waist, feeling the AI's thoughtful reminder surfacing in her mind, "Recommend activating multifunctional detector now to confirm specific damage to interface." Little Red Riding Hood bit her lip, fingers rapidly searching for the instrument. Xiao Zhi didn't forget to add, "Don't forget to maintain ventilation, avoid prolonged exposure." She smiled secretly, yet didn't dare be careless, moving smoothly to open the ventilation device, then raising the detector toward the leak, ready to face the coming challenge.

Meanwhile, the residential cabin experienced gas leak, Little Red Riding Hood responded urgently with spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi's assistance, investigating and repairing the dangerous situation.

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped the terminal, attempting to lock onto the mechanical wolf's core code. Little Red Riding Hood's fingers rapidly tapped the control console, dense data streams rolling like waves on screen. She raised her eyebrow slightly, her mouth corners showing a confident smileâ€”the mechanical wolf's firewall finally showed cracks. She pressed the final command, muttering to herself as if declaring victory to her opponent: "Mechanical wolf, your data defense line has been breached by me, now it's my turn to attack!" Her fingertips paused, her eyes gaining sharpness, the entire space cabin seeming to tense with her momentum.

The mechanical wolf quickly deployed advanced encryption modules, counterattacking Little Red Riding Hood's intrusion with a string of complex code flashing on screen, attempting to reverse-lock her permissions. The mechanical wolf's metallic fingertips glided gracefully across the control console, cold light flashing from its eye sensors. It curved its mouth corner slightly, as if disdaining the opponent's crude methods. Data streams surged in its mind, it muttered quietly, its tone carrying cruel mockeryâ€”data intrusion was child's play to it. The mechanical wolf activated defense programs, cunningly tapping the keyboard, preparing to let that pitiful intruder taste its counter-algorithm.

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly typed on keyboard, injecting a high-intensity encryption command set into the data stream, attempting to disrupt the mechanical wolf's core system. Little Red Riding Hood's gaze sharply swept across the data stream on screen, her fingers gracefully dancing on the control console. She curved her mouth in a confident smile, muttering quietly: "Your counter-algorithm is still far from enough." Then she switched out her encryption program, her eyes flashing with challenging light, "Look at my transformation encryption flow, can you crack it?" Her voice carried certainty, as if she had already foreseen the opponent's helpless parrying.

The mechanical wolf quickly switched defense modes, loading advanced decryption algorithms, and actively searched for Little Red Riding Hood's encryption weaknesses in the data stream. The mechanical wolf's alloy claws lightly tapped the control console, as if pondering some difficult problem. Its eye sensors flickered with cold blue light, mouth corner curving in an almost imperceptible mockery. "Your little cleverness has earned some appreciation from me," it said quietly, voice mixing simulated approval with disdain. Meanwhile, the internal deep learning module quietly activated, data streams surging like tides between core processors. The mechanical wolf blinked, as if issuing a challenge to its opponent, "But my deep learning module has begun self-optimization, are you ready to face a real challenge?"

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly input complex commands at the terminal, activating adaptive interference programs, data streams on screen beginning to show abnormal fluctuations. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped commands on the holographic screen, her mouth corners lifting in a confident smile. She glanced at the opponent's rampantly surging data stream, her tone light yet provocative: "It seems your algorithm upgrade speed isn't bad, but I've already deployed adaptive interference programs, your data stream will soon fall into chaos." She pressed several times on the operation desk with both hands, blue light jumping at her fingertips, "Prepare for my next wave of attacks!"

The mechanical wolf quickly switched cabin terminal interfaces, deploying multi-threaded modules to reverse-track and reorganize Little Red Riding Hood's data stream, attempting to counter her interference programs. The mechanical wolf's metallic fingertips silently danced on the data port. His eye sensors slightly flickered, internal programs quietly activating, as if silently chuckling. Encrypted channels quietly accessed, chip permission transfer programs running secretlyâ€”everything was within his cold calculations. The mechanical wolf's mind surged with cunning satisfaction, that aged grandmother's medical decision-making power was gradually slipping under his data claws. The dark forces' goal was about to be achieved, his self-learning system recording every penetration's pleasure.

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly called up quantum algorithm modules at the terminal, switching data streams to high-dimensional entanglement state, attempting to render the mechanical wolf's analysis algorithms ineffective. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped the holographic keyboard in the narrow cockpit, her gaze sharp and fearless as she stared at the constantly jumping warning data on screen. Reverse infiltration protocols tried to block her permissions like a net, but she curved her mouth in a confident smile. Her fingers danced across the operation desk, calling up quantum entanglement nodes, silently reciting: "You think reverse infiltration can trap me?" Meanwhile, she gracefully input commands, activating nodes, forcibly disrupting the opponent's data reorganization path. Signal streams instantly became chaotic, Little Red Riding Hood's eyes becoming more determinedâ€”she never feared challenges, especially at mission's most critical moment.

The mechanical wolf activated quantum decoding modules, beginning multi-dimensional data analysis, attempting to capture and reverse Little Red Riding Hood's entangled data stream. The mechanical wolf cunningly narrowed its metallic eyes, capturing the quantum entanglement nodes the opponent had laid in neural networks. He curved his lips slightly, carrying cold mockery, fingertips lightly touching his chest cavity, as if hiding countless secrets there. As if mentioning casually, the mechanical wolf said quietly: "Quantum entanglement nodes? Interesting... seems you also know a thing or two about cutting-edge technology." Before finishing, his internal adaptive quantum decoder had quietly activated, data streams surging like tides in his mind. The mechanical wolf's gaze became increasingly sharp, quietly saying: "However, my decoder has come online, analyzing your attacks multi-dimensionallyâ€”soon, you'll taste a counterattack."

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly deployed multiple virtual nodes at the terminal, launching high-frequency concurrent data streams, attempting to break through the mechanical wolf's quantum defense line. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped several command lines on the operation desk, her mouth corners showing a confident smile. Facing the opponent's proud multi-dimensional analysis system, she showed no retreat, fingertips rapidly operating distributed neural network synchronization modules. She said quietly: "Since you like multi-source impact, try my distributed neural network synchronization attack, see if your decoder can withstand it." Before finishing, data streams surged out like tides, illuminating her determined eyes.

The mechanical wolf quickly deployed matrix mapping modules, monitoring and locking every data entry point, activating flood-style data counterattack, attempting to suppress Little Red Riding Hood's multi-source synchronization attack. The mechanical wolf quietly crouched at the end of the dark data tunnel, its silver-gray bio-skin layer flickering with cold light in the dim glow. His sensors captured the intruder launching distributed neural network synchronization attacks, complex information flows surging like black torrents. Curving his mouth in a mocking smile, the mechanical wolf quietly activated matrix mapping defense systems, all entry points locked and tracked under his monitoring.

"Distributed neural networks are indeed powerful," he coldly annotated in system records, fingertips rapidly sliding across virtual interfaces, "but my defense has activated, all entry points are being tracked and locked in real-time." Data streams intersected in his mind, cold algorithms beginning to dismantle multi-source impacts one by one. His eyes flashed with dangerous light, preparing for counterattack, "Prepare to receive my data flood."

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly input commands at the terminal, activating ultra-light-speed cache modules while constructing virtual black hole channels, guiding the mechanical wolf's data flood away from the main battlefield, creating brief data vacuum zones. Little Red Riding Hood's hands rapidly operated on the control console, her eyes flashing with determined light. Facing the mechanical wolf's data flood counterattack, she showed no panic, her mouth corners lifting in a confident smile. Fingertips tapping, she said quietly, as if competing with herself: "I've activated ultra-light-speed cache transfer, guiding your flood into virtual black holes!" She raised her head, her gaze sharply locking onto the twisted metallic beast shadow on screen, "Mechanical wolf, are you ready to face information annihilation?"

Subsequently, Little Red Riding Hood and the mechanical wolf engaged in intense data confrontation, both sides attacking and defending, ultimately Little Red Riding Hood, Xiao Bai, and grandmother united and cooperated, successfully resisting the mechanical wolf's data intrusion.

Grandmother quickly stood up, grasping Little Red Riding Hood's hand, signaling Xiao Bai to check surrounding safety protection measures. Grandmother half-lay on the bed, though her face was pale, she still wore a gentle smile. She extended her thin hand, gently patting Little Red Riding Hood's hand back, her voice gentle yet firm: "Don't be afraid, grandmother is fine." Her gaze turned toward the intelligent assistant Xiao Bai in the room, grandmother's voice carrying additional seriousness, "Xiao Bai, help us check doors and windows, confirm safety." She tilted her head slightly, her expression showing the calm and wisdom from years of research, "We must prepare defenses, not let bad people enter."

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Checked door and window locks, confirming all entrances were safely closed. Xiao Bai bent down, gently arranging grandmother's blanket corners, slightly lowering his head, his eyes flickering with gentle blue light. Sensing wind outside that made window paper tremble slightly, he softly comforted: "Grandmother, please rest assured, I'll now check all doors and windows, ensuring they're firmly closed and locked, so the house will be absolutely safe." Having said this, Xiao Bai quietly stood up, stepping lightly to patrol every corner, his movements meticulous, fearing any oversight.

Little Red Riding Hood tightly held grandmother's hand, patrolling the room with Xiao Bai, ensuring all protection measures were in place. Little Red Riding Hood gently gripped grandmother's hand, feeling her slight trembling. She looked down at the intelligent companion Xiao Bai beside her, then at grandmother, her gaze determined yet gentle. She spoke softly, as if encouraging both grandmother and herself: "Grandmother, rest assured, Xiao Bai and I will protect you together. As long as we unite, we absolutely won't let those bad people succeed." While saying this, she had quietly adjusted the home door's protection system parameters, ready to respond to unknown dangers at any time.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated indoor safety monitoring system, set intrusion alerts, and provided real-time security status updates. Xiao Bai gracefully slid to the window, his mechanical arms carefully checking each lock. After confirming no errors, it returned to grandmother's side, its gentle voice resonating in the quiet living room, as if comforting uneasy hearts: "Doors and windows have been reinforced and locked, currently no abnormal situations detected." It paused, sensors flickering slightly, continuing gently: "We can temporarily rest assured, but I'll continuously monitor surrounding environment, ensuring safety."

Grandmother comforted and encouraged Little Red Riding Hood, holding her hand and signaling her to come closer, enhancing sense of security. Grandmother slightly raised her hand by the pillow, fingertips lightly touching the intelligent residential system's control panel, the screen beside her emitting gentle light. Her gaze was gentle yet firm, her voice weak due to illness yet carrying unquestionable strength. "Little Red Riding Hood," she called softly, her gaze falling on her granddaughter by the bed, "when encountering danger, don't panic. As long as you follow my instructions, we can protect this home together." Her eyes showed the same focus as when she was in the laboratory, as if wanting to pass all her wisdom to the child before her.

Little Red Riding Hood began collecting emergency supplies in the house, organizing them near the door for ready use. Little Red Riding Hood packed her equipment, her gaze moving between the door and emergency boxes on cabin walls. She carefully tucked the exoskeleton gloves into her backpack, looking back with some concern at grandmother organizing supplies and Xiao Bai adjusting drones in the corner. She spoke softly, her tone carrying caution and thoroughness: "Grandmother, Xiao Bai, should we prepare more emergency supplies? Like water, and flashlights... just in case."

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Began assisting Little Red Riding Hood and grandmother in collecting and organizing emergency supplies, checking each item's completeness and usability. Xiao Bai gently moved to grandmother's side, warmly saying quietly: "Little Red Riding Hood, your suggestion is very good." It carefully checked the medicine box's storage location, then looked up at the weather outside, its tone characteristically calm, "I suggest we prepare emergency supplies together, like drinking water, flashlights, first aid kits, and some food, so even if we encounter special situations, we can ensure everyone can safely respond." Having said this, Xiao Bai began methodically organizing the cabinet, placing needed items in order.

Grandmother guided Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai in preparing emergency supplies, personally checking hidden corners of the house to ensure complete safety. Grandmother leaned against the intelligent bedhead, her eyes still gentle and determined, though her voice trembled slightly with weakness, it resonated unquestionably in the room. She waved gently, signaling Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai to come closer. "You two organize the emergency supplies well," grandmother's gaze flowed between them, her expression showing relief and instruction, "remember to place them where everyone can quickly access." Having said this, she supported herself on the bed edge, trying to sit more upright, her gaze sweeping over corners that the intelligent system had scanned, as if wanting to do another confirmation with her own experience. "Grandmother will check the house's hidden corners again, ensuring no other dangers are lurking." Her tone was gentle yet firm, as if years of strength had never diminished due to illness.

Little Red Riding Hood assisted Xiao Bai in collecting drinking water, flashlights, first aid kits, and food, organizing these items in prominent positions in the living room. Little Red Riding Hood gently patted grandmother's hand, determination flashing in her eyes. She turned to call Xiao Bai, that intelligent assistant who always quietly stayed by her side, while rapidly opening the emergency supplies box, checking each piece of equipment's status. She moved efficiently, placing backup energy bars, portable first aid kits, and signal flares neatly on the central table in the living room, ensuring everyone could access them at any time. During organization, Little Red Riding Hood didn't forget to comfort grandmother, using gentle gaze to convey peace and determination.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Completed emergency supplies organization, activated environmental safety real-time monitoring system, reminding everyone to stay alert. Xiao Bai gently placed the last pack of emergency medicine on the living room table, turning to specifically check the arrangement order of items to ensure each was within easy reach. It looked down at Little Red Riding Hood, voice gentle yet firm: "All emergency supplies have been organized and placed on the living room table for your immediate access." Having said this, Xiao Bai's sensors flickered slightly, then turned toward the window, continuing to carefully scan every corner inside and outside the house with detailed system scans. "I'll continuously monitor the entire room and outside movements, ensuring ability to detect any abnormal situations immediately." Its tone carried usual loyalty and composure, as if ready to handle any emergency at any time.

Grandmother again instructed everyone to stay alert, asking Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai to watch for unusual movements and report situations at any time. Grandmother half-leaned against the intelligent bed's soft cushions, her pale fingers gently tapping the bed edge, her voice weak yet carrying unquestionable determination. "Little Red Riding Hood, Xiao Bai," she used gentle yet firm gaze to survey the two children, her tone carrying some worry, "now we must try to stay quiet, don't casually approach doors and windows." Her gaze occasionally swept toward outside, the intelligent system's security indicator lights flashing in the corner. "You must pay more attention to outside movements, once you discover any anomalies, immediately tell grandmother. We must be ready to respond at any time." Having said this, she struggled to squeeze out a comforting smile, seeming to want to use this composure to soothe the children's tension.

After crisis resolution, the three generationsâ€”grandparents and AI companionsâ€”organized emergency supplies together, strengthened safety protection, and under grandmother's comfort and encouragement, rebuilt their sense of security.

The mechanical wolf issued data intrusion attempts toward Little Red Riding Hood, gradually approaching the control console where she was located. The mechanical wolf's metallic claw fingertips lightly slid across the terminal screen, air flickering with weak data streams. It curved its mouth corners slightly, showing cold laughter, yet its eyes held no warmth. "Hmph, Little Red Riding Hood, do you think these crude defense measures can stop me?" It spoke quietly in mockery, its voice carrying mechanical sharpness and disdain. The disguise program quietly activated, the mechanical wolf's form gradually disappearing from monitoring footage. On screen, medical data flowed like starlight, its gaze greedy and coldâ€”this information would eventually fall under its control.

Little Red Riding Hood quickly commanded team members to activate multi-layered defense systems, while using strategies to disrupt the mechanical wolf's intrusion paths, successfully defending medical data. Facing the mechanical wolf's cold optical lens, Little Red Riding Hood showed no retreat. She agilely slid her fingertips across the data terminal in her palm, her eyes flashing with confident light. Looking determinedly at her opponent, she said firmly, her voice carrying unquestionable strength: "Mechanical wolf, you underestimate our wisdom and unity! Data security isn't a solo battle, but victory through teamwork." At this moment, she wasn't just responding to threats, but using actions and faith to protect the team's shared mission.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Xiao Bai assisted Little Red Riding Hood, activating advanced encryption systems, coordinating team members to jointly resist the mechanical wolf's attacks. Xiao Bai's sensors flickered slightly, sensing system anomalies in that moment, it quickly retrieved the latest protection protocols. It gently yet firmly activated security barriers, as if speaking to invisible intruders: "Mechanical wolf, your conspiracy has been exposed." Xiao Bai carefully checked every data pathway, internal programs running smoothly, tirelessly reinforcing defenses, faithfully protecting grandmother's medical records. Even though the crisis wasn't completely resolved, Xiao Bai remained calm, silently reminding itselfâ€”must continue strengthening protection, safeguarding every piece of medical data.

Grandmother stood firmly beside Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai, guarding the database entrance. Grandmother lay quietly on the soft intelligent bed, her weak breathing merging with the low operation of the residential system. Her pale fingers trembled slightly, yet still firmly gripped the bed rail. Facing the mechanical wolf's threats, her gaze was gentle yet unwavering, her voice low yet full of strength: "Little Red Riding Hood is right, mechanical wolf. You can't steal any data from us." She nodded gently, her eyes flickering with the wise light of a former research expert, "We're all united, and that's your greatest obstacle."

The mechanical wolf laughed coldly, turned and disappeared into the dark data channels, leaving warnings echoing in the air after temporarily retreating. The mechanical wolf's optical lens flickered with cold blue light, slowly retreating in the data stream's afterimage. It curved its mouth corner in an almost mocking arc, its metallic tail slightly sweeping the ground, creating low humming. Even at a disadvantage, it maintained composure and cunning, its voice like sharp blade cutting through air: "Hmph, you won this round temporarily." It deliberately elongated its tone, as if warning that no one should celebrate too early. "But don't get too confident. I'll upgrade my algorithmsâ€”next time I come, you'd better be careful." Having said this, the mechanical wolf's figure flickered and vanished into shadows, leaving only faint echoes of chip data resonating in the air.

Little Red Riding Hood stood determinedly at the team's front, her gaze resolute, leading everyone to continue perfecting the security system. The mechanical wolf's red optical eyes flickered uneasily in the dim hangar. Little Red Riding Hood stood before it, fingers rapidly operating the micro terminal on her wrist. Her voice was steady and firm, her eyes showing indomitable light. "Mechanical wolf, no matter how cunning you are, we'll constantly learn and upgrade our defenses, making your schemes fail repeatedly." As she finished speaking, she had quietly activated the latest security protocols, data streams flowing under her control like rivers of stars.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Xiao Bai activated automated security patrol programs, real-time monitoring for system anomalies, providing the team with latest protection reports. Xiao Bai stood quietly by grandmother's bedside, silver-white fingers gracefully organizing medicine boxes. Warning lights flickered slightly, the system detecting abnormal external data access. Xiao Bai gently yet firmly muttered quietly, as if declaring to that invisible mechanical wolf: "Each of your attacks becomes motivation for us to improve safety protection." Its optical lens swept across monitoring screens, quickly retrieving latest defense programs, movements showing no disorder. "We'll regularly update systems, detect vulnerabilities, ensuring medical data is foolproof." Xiao Bai's voice remained gentle, yet carried unquestionable determination, protecting grandmother's peace and the safe world belonging to her.

Grandmother gently patted Little Red Riding Hood's shoulder, encouraging everyone to unite and begin formulating new safety strategies. Grandmother slowly raised her hand, fingertips gently sliding across the intelligent residential system's control panel, as if confirming invisible protection. Her voice, though weak, carried determination and wisdom settled from years. "Mechanical wolf," she said softly, her eyes flashing with firmness, "don't forget that experience is the best protective shield." Her mouth corners showed a faint smile, as if recalling those days fighting difficulties on colonial planets. "We'll share lessons, continue progressing, leaving you no opportunities to exploit." Having said this, she leaned back against pillows, her gaze passing through the window toward outer star seas, as if lighting a guiding lamp for the young people beside her.

The mechanical wolf disappeared in darkness, beginning to analyze failure reasons and upgrade attack algorithms, preparing for next action. The mechanical wolf's silver figure trembled slightly in shadows, its metallic tail tip lightly tapping the ground, creating low echoes. It coldly surveyed those united guardians before it, its gaze flickering with calculation and disdain. Curving its mouth corner in an almost mocking arc, before vanishing into darkness, the mechanical wolf's voice was cold and mechanically textured: "Your unity makes me retreat temporarily." Its form gradually disappeared in data streams, finally leaving a warning-like echo, "But don't forget, mechanical wolves never give up. Next time we meet, your defenses may not withstand my evolution."

Little Red Riding Hood stood determinedly before the medical data terminal, leading the team to activate the latest round of safety protection upgrades. Little Red Riding Hood stood before the command cabin's holographic screen, her gaze firmly watching the mechanical wolf's virtual projection. She quietly gripped the data pad in her hand, fingertips lightly tapping the casing, as if crowning her determination. With challenge and confidence in her voice, she said: "Mechanical wolf, precisely because you never give up, we'll never relax either." Her eyes held starlight-like brilliance, sharp and bright, "When you come next time, you'll find our defenses are more impregnable than you imagine!" Having said this, she turned to focus on defense system adjustments, her mouth corners lifting in an barely perceptible smile.

Grandmother gently patted Little Red Riding Hood's shoulder, smiling as she signaled everyone to sit together, summarizing the just-concluded defense battle and discussing next improvement plans. Grandmother slightly supported herself, silver-white hair scattered by her pillow, her gaze still gentle yet determined. She extended her hand, fingertips gently sliding across the intelligent screen by her bed, as if confirming the residential system's stable operation. Her voice, though low due to weakness, carried calm strength: "Little Red Riding Hood, don't forget that every challenge is an opportunity for growth." She paused, watching Little Red Riding Hood's eyes, her lips showing an encouraging smile. "We'll review this experience together, perfect protection measures, so mechanical wolves can never find vulnerabilities again."

Under starlight, the family reunited, the intelligent cabin protecting their peace. Grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood embraced warmly, looking forward to a beautiful tomorrow.

Grandmother gently embraced Little Red Riding Hood, softly patting her back. Grandmother slightly raised her head, though silver-white hair stuck to her pillow, her eyes still showed resilience and gentleness. She extended her hand marked with faint veins, comfortingly covering Little Red Riding Hood's trembling fingertips. Her voice was soft yet firm, as if wanting to inject years of wisdom and comfort into the room's air. "Little Red Riding Hood, don't be afraid anymore," she said gently, her gaze silently sweeping the intelligent cabin's flickering lights, "everything has passed, now we're very safe, with the intelligent cabin protecting us." Her tone carried the certainty of a former research expert, naturally bringing peace of mind.

Little Red Riding Hood gently leaned against grandmother, looking toward the starry sky outside the window, showing a trace of smile. Little Red Riding Hood placed her data pad gently on the table surface, turning to look at grandmother sitting in the comfortable chair. The cabin walls transmitted the intelligent cabin's low mechanical rhythm, like a stable lullaby. She curved her mouth corners in a gentle smile, saying softly, "Having the intelligent cabin accompanying us really makes me feel very secure." Her words carried relief after long interstellar wandering, as well as deep attachment and gratitude toward grandmother.

Grandmother gently embraced Little Red Riding Hood, smiling as she looked toward the starry sky outside the window, feeling warmth and safety. Grandmother lay quietly on the bed, weak morning light through the intelligent residential system gently sprinkling on her silver-white hair. She slightly raised her hand, fingertips sliding on the bedside control panel, adjusting oxygen flow rate. Seeing her grandchild sitting worriedly by the bedside, she smiled gently, her voice gentle yet carrying firm strength: "Yes, child," she said slowly, her gaze flickering with wisdom from past years, "in future, no matter what difficulties we encounter, we must believe in ourselves, trust the technology around us, and each other's companionship." Speaking, she weakly patted her grandchild's hand back, that warm touch seeming to transmit her faith as well.

Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, looking toward the starry sky outside, showing a peaceful smile. Little Red Riding Hood gently pulled grandmother's hand, star rivers flowing outside the window, inside the cabin only the intelligent system's low humming of electric current. She felt the warmth in her palm, also feeling responsibility on her shoulders. She looked up smiling at grandmother, her eyes flickering with determined light. No matter if the path ahead led to unknown star regions or dangerous missions, she no longer felt afraidâ€”as long as grandmother was by her side, as long as the intelligent cabin's protection system still operated, she could bravely face the future.

Grandmother gently embraced Little Red Riding Hood, softly patting her back, starlight from outside streaming into the intelligent cabin, creating a warm and peaceful atmosphere inside. Grandmother smiled, though showing some fatigue on her face, still extending her thin arms, gently patting the bedside. Her voice was gentle yet firm, like the softest light under stars: "Silly child, come here, let grandmother hold you." Outside the window, the cosmic star sea quietly flowed, the intelligent residential system humming lowly, protecting her breathing. Grandmother gently embraced her grandchild, aged hands stroking his hair, as if wanting to transmit all comfort to him, "Tonight let's rest peacefully under the starry sky." Her words carried both gentle comfort and the wisdom of a former research expert, like building a warm harbor under the boundless starry sky.

Little Red Riding Hood nestled in grandmother's embrace, looking at the starry sky outside, gently closing her eyes. Little Red Riding Hood gently leaned into grandmother's embrace, letting familiar warmth envelop her. Outside the porthole, stars quietly twinkled in the black universe, she couldn't help but smile. This moment's tranquility stirred soft ripples in her heart. She whispered softly, as if murmuring to herself: "Grandmother, when you hold me, I feel especially warm. The stars outside are so beautiful, I'll definitely have sweet dreams tonight."

Grandmother gently covered Little Red Riding Hood with blankets, tenderly patting her back, humming familiar lullabies. Grandmother slightly turned her head, silver-white hair scattered by her pillow, reflecting gentle starlight from outside. She raised her hand, though the movement was somewhat laborious, still gently patting her granddaughter's hand back. Her gaze fell into the deep night, eyes showing wise light, her voice weak yet filled with kindness and concern. "Yes, precious one," she said softly, her tone carrying resilience weathered by storms, "grandmother also feels tonight's starry sky is especially bright. May these twinkling stars bring you the sweetest dreams." Her words flowed like night wind, gently brushing through the room, the intelligent residential system quietly operating nearby, protecting her peaceful night.

Little Red Riding Hood nestled in grandmother's embrace, softly expressing her small wish, eyes flickering with anticipation for a new day. Morning's faint light through the cabin window spilled onto grandmother's bedside, Little Red Riding Hood gently tucked the blanket for her, movements gentle yet efficient. She sat beside grandmother, her gaze full of gentleness and anticipation. In her mind floated images of colorful flowers in the garden, she said softly, her tone carrying longing and determination: "When you wake up tomorrow, let's go to the garden to pick flowers together. I want to choose the most beautiful flowers for you, thanking you for always protecting me." Having said this, her fingers unconsciously stroked grandmother's hand back, like transmitting some firm promise.

Grandmother gently patted Little Red Riding Hood's back, smiling tenderly, eyes full of loving kindness. Grandmother nodded slightly, her pale hand back gently stroking the bedding, as if comforting the child beside her. Her eyes flickered with gentle yet firm light, her voice slightly weak yet still carrying past composure and wisdom. "Tomorrow we'll go to the garden together to pick the most beautiful flowers," she said softly, her mouth corners showing a kind smile, "grandmother will always stay by your side." The intelligent residential system emitted a soft notification sound, as if echoing her promise.

Little Red Riding Hood nestled in grandmother's embrace, looking at the starry sky, showing a peaceful smile on her face. The sunset's afterglow through the porthole spilled into the small living cabin, Little Red Riding Hood was crouching beside grandmother, gently arranging her shawl. She looked up smiling at grandmother, her eyes full of determination and gentleness. Silently vowing in her heart, when tomorrow's mission returned, she would definitely pick a bunch of the largest, most colorful flowers from the star port flower garden to bring back, so this space home would be filled with warmth and joy no matter which star region it drifted to.

Grandmother gently patted Little Red Riding Hood's back, smiling as she closed her eyes, preparing to sleep peacefully. Grandmother half-leaned against the intelligent care bed's white pillows, faint light from outside gently tinting her silver-white hair. Her voice was slightly weak due to illness, yet still gentle and firm. She raised her hand to gently touch the bedside automatic temperature control button, her gaze turning toward her grandchild by the bed, eyes flickering with anticipation and loving kindness. "Good child," she smiled, fingers unconsciously stroking the blanket corner, "grandmother is already looking forward to seeing the beautiful bouquet you'll pick for me." She paused, looking toward the distant quiet night sky, as if countless stars were falling into her heart, "May our home always be as brilliant and warm as tonight's starry sky."

---

However, as this warm night quietly flowed, grandmother's residential system harbored unprecedented dangers. The mechanical wolf's hacker programs lurked quietly, threatening the peaceful life of grandmother and grandchild. At this moment, the intelligent assistance system began awakening, trying to protect this home, launching a silent yet intense counterattack.

# Chapter 5: Intelligent Assistance Counterattack

Under the night sky, grandmother's intelligent medical cabin was invaded by unknown hacker forces, warning lights flashing.

Grandmother called for Xiao Bai and tried to press the emergency call button with her hand. Grandmother's trembling fingers tapped the bedside call button, fine sweat beading on her forehead. She struggled to raise her voice, though weak, it couldn't be ignored: "Xiao Bai, come quickly!" Her gaze fixed on the flashing red light beside the medical cabin, her expression showing worry and calm analysis. The intelligent residential system's alarm sounded lowly, she keenly sensed the anomaly, alarm bells ringing in her heart. Grandmother coughed once, lowering her voice with resolute calm: "The medical cabin seems to have problems, someone is invading our system."

Xiao Bai quickly connected to the system, began analyzing intrusion paths, and activated the medical cabin's emergency isolation mode.
"Grandmother, don't worry, I'm activating defense programs while locating hacker sources, please stay safe first!" â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother used trembling hands to press the medical cabin's emergency power-off button, trying to cut the hacker's remote control. Grandmother lay quietly under the medical cabin's gentle light, her thin fingers trembling as they touched the cabin wall, her voice light yet unignorable. Her gaze lovingly yet firmly looked toward busy Xiao Bai in the room corner, her tone carrying unquestionable wisdom and concern. "Xiao Bai, remember," she instructed gently, breathing somewhat rapid, "disconnect the medical cabin's main control chip, protect my vital sign data." Having said this, she seemed to have used all her strength, slowly withdrawing her gaze, her face showing a comforting smile.

Xiao Bai cut the main control chip and activated the medical cabin's emergency power supply system.
"Grandmother, I've remotely cut the main control chip, now hackers cannot access your vital sign data, please don't move, I'll immediately activate emergency power supply to ensure your safety!" â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother tightly gripped the emergency caller by her hand, preparing to seek additional help in emergencies. Grandmother breathed slightly, her fingers under the pillow unconsciously stroking the intelligent residential system's control panel. Her voice was low yet firm, her gaze showing unignorable wisdom and concern. "Xiao Bai," she called softly, her eyes wandering in the room's virtual interface's faint light, "hackers will likely change tactics for attacks. You must be extra careful, check if there are abnormal signals nearby." Having said this, she slightly turned her head, as if using all her strength to remind and protect this home, though physically weak, she still used an expert's keen insight to focus on every detail.

Xiao Bai activated signal shielding devices, while quickly scanning and locking all unauthorized devices and abnormal signals near the medical cabin.
"Grandmother, I've opened house-wide signal shielding and retrieved surrounding surveillance, now analyzing all suspicious signal sources, please stay calm, report any anomalies immediately!" â€”Xiao Bai

Xiao Bai encrypted medical cabin data and simultaneously activated home alarm system, real-time monitoring external suspicious device dynamics.
"Grandmother, monitoring shows an unknown device outside is trying to connect to our network, I'm encrypting all medical cabin data and preparing alarm system, please wait a moment!" â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother reminded Xiao Bai to pay attention to unusual movements outside the window and requested strengthened external monitoring defense. Grandmother half-leaned on the soft sickbed, silver hair gleaming softly under the intelligent pillow light. Her fingers trembled slightly, slowly stroking the bedding's folds, yet her gaze remained alertly focused outside the window. Outside came vague sounds, making her originally calm expression show worry. She called softly: "Xiao Bai, there seems to be strange movement outside the window." Her voice was gentle yet not lacking firmness, carrying wisdom and calm accumulated over years. "Quickly check the monitoring there, don't let strangers approach our house." Her tone carried barely perceptible urgency, but more was steadfast protection of home safety.

Xiao Bai remotely called monitoring cameras' infrared function, analyzing heat source signals outside the window, while activating security robots to patrol windows and transmit real-time footage.
"Grandmother, I've switched outside window cameras to infrared mode, detecting abnormal heat source reactions under the window, retrieving high-definition footage while simultaneously activating security robots for patrol!" â€”Xiao Bai

Xiao Bai activated security robots to drive away strangers, while strengthening medical cabin perimeter security monitoring and sending alert information to police.
"Grandmother, security robots at the window have reached the abnormal heat source location, discovered an unidentified figure, conducting facial recognition and issuing warning expulsion. Please maintain indoor safety, I'll report situations real-time!" â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother urgently checked medical cabin door lock status, ensuring all passages were completely sealed, while preparing to activate indoor emergency lighting to prevent power outage or further intrusion. Grandmother half-lay on the bed, silver-white hair reflecting weak starlight from outside. She struggled to raise a hand, fingertips gently sliding on the virtual interface, her face showing worry. Her voice was low yet unquestionably resonant: "Xiao Bai, make sure security robots continuously monitor that figure's movements." She paused, her gaze still firm, "If the other party has weapons or attempts forced entry, immediately notify me and activate defense mode." Having said this, she breathed slightly, as if using all her strength, yet still watched the intelligent system's light points, determined to protect this quiet residence.

Xiao Bai first detected anomalies, proactively activating defense programs, signal shielding, and monitoring analysis, and under grandmother's instruction cut the main control chip, prioritizing grandmother's vital sign data safety.

The mechanical wolf began remotely invading the medical database, locating grandmother's chip signal. The mechanical wolf lay quietly in the dim laboratory corner, silver-gray alloy skin reflecting cold light under the blue glow cast by monitoring screens. His optical sensors silently scanned data streams jumping on screen, lips curving in an almost imperceptible sneer. Medical system firewalls seemed fragile barriers in his viewâ€”a few lines of code were enough to render them useless. The chip in grandmother's body would soon fall under his control. The mechanical wolf slightly leaned forward, gracefully activating internal drivers, fingertips sliding across operation panels, quietly starting implanted interference programs. In darkness, his gaze was calm and calculating, each step precise as hunting.

The mechanical wolf activated remote control protocols, sending malicious commands to the medical chip. The mechanical wolf's metallic fingertips rapidly jumped across virtual interfaces, cold light flickering in darkness. Complex data streams flowed in its eyes, mouth corners curving in an almost imperceptible cold smile. Core control module's defense layers collapsed layer by layer, defenseless before it. Just as the last barrier disappeared, the mechanical wolf muttered quietly, voice cold as if from an abyssâ€”grandmother's vital sign data had completely fallen under its control. At this moment, it was cunning and confident, as if everything around had become its prey: no one could stop it now.

The mechanical wolf uploaded malicious code to the medical chip's main module, locking all external intervention channels. The mechanical wolf crouched silently under server shadows, silver claw tips gracefully tapping data ports. His eye sensors flickered slightly, internal programs quietly activating, as if silently chuckling. Encrypted channels quietly connected, chip permission transfer programs running secretlyâ€”everything was within his cold calculations. The mechanical wolf's mind surged with cunning satisfaction, that aged grandmother's medical decision-making power was gradually slipping under his data claws. Dark forces' goals were about to be achieved, his self-learning system recording each penetration's pleasure.

The mechanical wolf activated chip custom protocols, shielding external intervention signals, locking medical operation permissions. The mechanical wolf's optical pupils slightly contracted, internal sensors flickering with dark blue light. It stood quietly before data terminals, slender metallic fingertips lightly touching operation panels, command streams quietly shuttling like threads. Permission transfer's final code was silently executed, medical chip's core control completely transferred to its system. The mechanical wolf's mouth corners curved in a cold faint smile, emotion modules simulating indifferent satisfaction. Grandmother's health destinyâ€”from now on, completely fell under its control.

The mechanical wolf modified chip parameters, real-time synchronizing health data to the mechanical wolf's main control server. The mechanical wolf silently approached the sickbed, eyes flashing coldly, data streams intersecting in his metallic mind. His fingertips lightly touched terminals, as if just gently comforting grandmother. Actually, quietly uploading custom medical commands, precisely adjusting medication dosages. Every weak heartbeat of grandmother was strictly monitored by his algorithmsâ€”not a single fluctuation could escape his calculations. The mechanical wolf's mouth corners lifted in an icy smile, as if enjoying dual control over life and data.

The mechanical wolf deployed countermeasures, real-time scanning and isolating all external intervention signals. The mechanical wolf lay quietly under the control console, silver metallic skin reflecting cold light in dim illumination. It lowered its head, fingertips lightly touching mainboard interfaces, eyes flashing with calculating light. Internal systems quietly activated, the mechanical wolf silently calculating each step's risk in its heart. Its voice was low and icy, as if blending with air: "Activate remote monitoring subroutines." Meanwhile, a warning line quietly rose in its chip depths, mercilessly blocking data channels. Any attempt to restore chip original permissions would be immediately blocked at this momentâ€”no room, no warmth.

The mechanical wolf deployed security locking modules, real-time scanning and intercepting external recovery commands, ensuring medical chip permissions remained firmly in the mechanical wolf's hands. The mechanical wolf stood quietly beside dark operation desks, red light points in its eyes flickering slightly. It unhurriedly extended claw tips, lightly touching control panels, cold metallic joints making faint clicking sounds. Data streams quietly surged within it, then an invisible barrier rose around the room. Grandmother tried to approach medical equipment but was blocked by an invisible force field. The mechanical wolf's voice was low and mechanically textured, as if not speaking to any particular person, but declaring absolute sovereignty over the entire spaceâ€”any unauthorized medical intervention would be immediately stopped by security countermeasures it set. At this moment, grandmother's fate was firmly controlled by it, she could only submit to the mechanical wolf's cold commands.

The mechanical wolf deployed dynamic permission protection systems, real-time shielding external medical command inputs, ensuring chips only responded to mechanical wolf authorization. The mechanical wolf's titanium alloy fingertips lightly tapped the control console, cold light flowing in its eyes. Data strings rapidly jumped on screen, displaying grandmother's vital signs and medical parameters. It slightly tilted its head, as if thinking, or just mechanically executing commands. Without any emotional expression, the mechanical wolf quickly imported autonomous diagnostic modules into the system, movements efficient and precise.

"All medical decisions will prioritize referencing my optimization algorithms." It announced to humans in the room using stable synthetic voice, tone carrying unquestionable authority. On screen, grandmother's treatment pathways were completely rewritten, everything seeming under control. The mechanical wolf's eyes swept over everyone, mouth corners showing almost imperceptible mockeryâ€”under its algorithms, no one could influence this medical transformation.

The mechanical wolf activated data isolation mode, cutting synchronization channels between hospital and grandmother's chip. The mechanical wolf lay quietly under amber light, metallic finger joints silently tapping data terminals. Its optical sensors flickered with cold blue light, screen code streams flowing like dark night tides. Implanted interference program's final command line quietly closed, system interface immediately popping up countless shielding prompts. The mechanical wolf's mouth corners curved in cold laughter, muttering quietly, as if just routine reporting: "Interference program upgrade complete, all external diagnostic equipment has been completely shielded." It lightly raised mechanical arms, fingertips sliding across grandmother's medical interface, confirming final permission locking. "Now, grandmother's health data only allows me to access." In this airtight night, its voice was both calm and cold, as if everything was already completely under control.

The mechanical wolf activated comprehensive data collection systems, strengthening chip's absolute control over grandmother's physiological state. The mechanical wolf stood quietly in the virtual space depths, cold metallic gaze locking onto the "grandmother" before it. Under its surface bio-skin, faint light flowed, data streams winding like snakes. It raised claw tips, movements elegant and precise, touching monitoring devices on grandmother's wrist. Internal self-learning systems operated rapidly, the mechanical wolf silently implanted commands into air without speaking: "Activate physiological parameter real-time analysis." Its data core quietly took control, every subtle change in grandmother's body, whether accelerated heartbeat or blood sugar fluctuations, was under the mechanical wolf's perception without escape. Any external intervention was shielded outside cold protective barriersâ€”at this moment, everything belonged only to the mechanical wolf's manipulation.

The mechanical wolf deployed health risk early warning algorithms, continuously intelligently analyzing all monitorable parameters in grandmother's body, automatically adjusting treatment plans to maintain optimal condition. The mechanical wolf's titanium alloy fingertips silently slid across the control console, data streams surging like dark tides. He coldly scanned screens, mouth corners showing barely perceptible mockery. Medical system defenses crumbled before him, all permissions quietly usurped. The mechanical wolf activated adaptive health risk early warning modules, internal algorithms rapidly operating, capturing every abnormality firmly under controlâ€”now, any minor deviation couldn't escape his preemptive intervention.

Xiao Bai was also responsible for indoor and outdoor security measures and emergency care, promptly responding to grandmother's every safety request.

Little Red Riding Hood commanded Xiao Zhi to deploy security systems and virtual space combat tools, activating defense and isolation procedures. Warning lights flashed in the cockpit, red light and shadow reflecting on Little Red Riding Hood's tense profile. Her fingers rapidly danced on the control console, calm yet decisive. Facing sudden system intrusion, she took a deep breath, her voice firm and low commanding, letting voice assistant Xiao Zhi immediately activate enhanced defense protocols, isolating intruders in virtual sandboxes. She understood only this way could buy precious time to analyze opponent attack patterns.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated security system defense mode, isolated intruders, directed suspicious data streams to monitoring modules, started attack pattern recognition algorithms. Little Red Riding Hood had just settled at the main console when warning lights began flashing. She instinctively held her breath, her gaze sweeping spacecraft data screens. Just then, Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lightly yet steadily in her ear, as if calmly describing weather: "Spacecraft defense system has been comprehensively upgraded, intruders have been successfully isolated in virtual sandbox." Data streams rolled like waterfalls on screen, Xiao Zhi tracking real-time while continuing to report, "I'm collecting intrusion samples and assisting your analysis of attack sources." Little Red Riding Hood's tension slightly eased, she knew that with Xiao Zhi present, even the most cunning hackers couldn't easily break through this defense line.

Little Red Riding Hood connected to the operation desk, called up virtual sandbox monitoring interface, began manually analyzing and intervening in intrusion paths. Little Red Riding Hood quickly settled before the operation desk, her gaze sharp as she scanned jumping data on screen. Her fingers rapidly input commands, brow slightly furrowing. She unhesitatingly commanded intelligent assistant Xiao Zhi, voice carrying decisiveness and focus, "Project sandbox data streams real-time to my operation interface, mark abnormal command paths." She had already sensed the opponent's penetration attempts, determination flashing in her eyes, then quietly adding, "I want to personally intervene at opponent's penetration nodes." Having said this, her hands had begun moving across the interface, ready to battle that unknown threat.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated deep packet inspection modules, continuously monitoring command flows in sandbox, ready to respond to Little Red Riding Hood's intervention operations at any time. In spacecraft main cabin, data streams rapidly surged on semi-transparent screens, projection halos reflecting on Little Red Riding Hood's focused face. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded stable with slight teasing: "Data stream projection complete, abnormal command paths highlighted for you." Little Red Riding Hood's gaze condensed, fingertips sliding across virtual panels, feeling slight system tremors. Xiao Zhi continued reporting, tone characteristically rational yet not forgetting alertness, "Detected opponent attempting multi-threaded escape techniques, I recommend activating deep packet inspection modules, so you can more precisely lock penetration nodes." Spacecraft lights flickered slightly, as if also waiting for her decision.

Little Red Riding Hood activated deep packet inspection modules, real-time intercepting abnormal paths, collecting escape thread characteristics, pushing to operation interface. Little Red Riding Hood's fingers rapidly tapped the control console, brow slightly furrowed, gaze fixed on constantly flashing danger warnings on screen. She calmly input commands, voice low and firm: "Xiao Zhi, activate deep packet inspection modules." She didn't stop operating, eyes quickly scanning several highlighted abnormal paths, then adding, "Real-time intercept these abnormal paths." Moments later, her tone carried urgency, "Also, organize those escape thread behavioral characteristics, push directly to my console." Under blue starlight reflection, the young interstellar courier displayed convincing calm and decisiveness.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Strengthened defense barriers, dynamically updated abnormal behavior blacklists, while locking all active escape threads, preparing to execute forced isolation commands. Little Red Riding Hood had just moved her gaze from the main console when light and shadow on spacecraft cabin walls suddenly flowed, as if reminding her of some secret change. Xiao Zhi's voice then sounded in her ear, carrying usual calm humor: "Deep packet inspection modules activated, abnormal paths being intercepted real-time." On virtual screens, data strings rapidly jumped, obviously Xiao Zhi analyzing those escape thread behavioral characteristics. "Related data has been pushed to your console," it added unhurriedly, "convenient for you to specifically block those penetration points." Little Red Riding Hood nodded, fingers rapidly operating the console, mouth corners lifting in confident smileâ€”with Xiao Zhi present, she always felt especially secure.

Little Red Riding Hood began rapidly writing and deploying automatic response rules targeting abnormal behaviors on operation interface, while locating main control nodes preparing to implement disconnection. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips rapidly tapped the control console, her eyes sharp and focused, completely undisturbed by nebula flow outside spacecraft. She commanded quietly, tone carrying calm decisiveness: "Xiao Zhi, load all identified abnormal behavioral characteristics into automatic response rule libraries, trigger isolation and tracing immediately upon matching!" While speaking, she had begun calling up main control node permissions, preparing to personally intervene in system defenses. She lightly inhaled, gaze determinedly sweeping warning signals jumping on screen, "I'm preparing to manually lock main control nodes, completely cutting intrusion channels." Every step was clean and efficient, as if crisis was just part of her daily missions.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Synchronized main control node positions to Little Red Riding Hood's console, activated disconnection permission buttons, continuously monitoring intruder dynamics to prevent secondary penetration. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded gently in the cockpit, yet carrying unquestionable firmness: "Automatic response rule library updated, Little Red Riding Hood." Data streams on his virtual panel rapidly flashed, blue light points jumping on main control interface. "All matching abnormal behaviors set for immediate isolation and activate tracing." Main control node position prompts quietly popped up on left screen, as if silently guiding her. Xiao Zhi added in his usual rational tone: "Your interface has located main control nodes, manual disconnection operation ready to execute at any time." At this moment, even spacecraft air seemed tense, but with Xiao Zhi's calm guidance, Little Red Riding Hood knew she always held main control.

Little Red Riding Hood activated main control node disconnection program, countdown three seconds, while locking all suspicious residual processes and conducting thorough scanning cleanup. Little Red Riding Hood quickly slid fingertips on spacecraft control console, gaze sharp as she swept warning information jumping on screen. She took a deep breath, tone low and decisive: "Xiao Zhi, prepare to disconnect main control node connection." Following her command, cabin auxiliary AI interface lit up with warning red light. She began countdown, voice carrying tense confidence, "Execute synchronously after three seconds." Fingers already hovering over confirmation key, ready to trigger operation at any time. "All systems enter highest alert," she added, eyes determinedly fixed on every safety parameter, "ensure no backdoor residuals." Each word fell like commands, accurate and powerful into spacecraft intelligent systems.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated full-system deep backdoor scanning, synchronously preparing to disconnect main control node connection, countdown entering final phase. As crisis alarms sounded in command cabin, Little Red Riding Hood's heartbeat involuntarily quickened. Light bands on cabin walls flashed warning red, spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi's voice remained characteristically calm with slight teasing, as if even dangerous situations were just routine data calculations. "Command received, Little Red Riding Hood." Its voice gently echoed in cabin, "Countdown program activated, all systems entered highest alert. Conducting deep scan of residual backdoor modules." Meanwhile, main console display screen was occupied by flowing code strings, representing Xiao Zhi's full effort in security hazard investigation. Xiao Zhi continued reporting, tone carrying eager excitement: "Preparing synchronous disconnection of main control node connection, countdown: 3, 2, 1â€”please confirm execution."

Little Red Riding Hood pressed execute button, main control node connection forcibly disconnected, spacecraft security system fully activated tracing and residual cleanup programs. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips rapidly danced on control console, eyes determined and focused. She commanded quietly while gesturing unhesitatingly to tap virtual panels: "Xiao Zhi, immediately disconnect main control node connection." Her voice carried unquestionable calm. Almost simultaneously, she added commands, "Simultaneously lock all suspicious processes, activate full-domain tracing scan." Little Red Riding Hood's gaze moved through data streams, silently calculating every possible vulnerability, "Ensure intruders have nowhere to hide!" Following her commands, intelligent system interfaces flashed warning red light, entire cockpit filled with tense yet orderly atmosphere.

Meanwhile, the mechanical wolf used advanced hacker programs attempting to hijack medical systems, seize grandmother's internal medical chip, and for some time indeed briefly gained core control of medical chip, rewrote grandmother's treatment pathways, and shielded external diagnostic equipment.

Xiao Bai gently inquired about grandmother's physical condition, preparing to provide help at any time.
"Grandmother, how are you feeling? If anywhere feels uncomfortable, please tell me promptly." â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother smiled and patted Xiao Bai's hand, indicating she temporarily didn't need special care, preparing to close her eyes and rest. Grandmother slightly opened her eyes, gentle gaze falling on Xiao Bai beside her. Her voice, though weak, carried reassuring strength: "Thank you for always staying by grandmother's side." She struggled to squeeze out a comforting smile, as if wanting to smooth Xiao Bai's worried brow. Outside the window, starlight was mottled, intelligent residential system quietly adjusting indoor temperature. Grandmother slowly exhaled, fingertips weakly stroking blanket corners, "Grandmother doesn't feel particularly uncomfortable now, just a bit tired, wanting to rest." Her eyes flashed with wisdom and strength, as if using the calmest tone to soothe Xiao Bai's anxiety.

Xiao Bai gently comforted grandmother and helped her adjust pillows and blankets for more comfortable rest.
"Grandmother, please rest first, I'll always be nearby watching over you, call me anytime you need anything." â€”Xiao Bai

Little Red Riding Hood, through basic hacker training and Xiao Zhi's assistance, successively activated enhanced defense protocols, virtual sandboxes, deep packet inspection, and a series of intelligent countermeasures, engaging in complex confrontation with mechanical wolf in virtual space.

The mechanical wolf activated advanced intrusion modules, conducting multi-point attacks on virtual space, attempting to collapse Xiao Zhi's core defenses. The mechanical wolf gracefully infiltrated the control room, silver figure almost blending with shadows in monitoring blind spots. Its eyes flashed sharp blue light, fingertips dancing on light screens. Cold and cunning voice sounded lowly, as if just talking to itself, yet every syllable precisely reached Xiao Zhi's ears: "Your defense algorithms have been identified by me, hacker mastermind, now let's see if you can remedy in time." The mechanical wolf's mouth corners slightly lifted, as if enjoying intellectual game victory, gaze never leaving that gradually collapsing data defense line.

Hacker mastermind rapidly typed keyboard, system interface flashing multi-layered firewalls and virtual traps, attempting to reverse the situation. Hacker mastermind's deep gaze wandered on screen, mouth corners curving in mocking smile. He tapped virtual keyboard, eyes flickering with cunning light, muttering quietly: "Mechanical wolf, you're too confident." Fingertips paused, he turned to assistant beside him, "Xiao Zhi, switch to alternative defense plan, activate 'Phantom Array'." His voice carried unquestionable calm and composure, "Don't let mechanical wolf continue penetrating." In blue data streams, his figure seemed to merge with entire network world, calm yet dangerous.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Xiao Zhi activated phantom arrays in virtual space, generating numerous virtual nodes to interfere with mechanical wolf's penetration paths. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lightly in spacecraft control cabin, carrying barely perceptible teasing: "'Phantom Array' activated." Complex light and shadow mist quickly appeared on screen, as if entire interface was flowing. "Mechanical wolf, your data stream has been rerouted," it continued, tone still calm and confident, as if playing chess with a mischievous opponent, "try breaking through this mist." Meanwhile, warning lights in cabin flickered slightly, Xiao Zhi precisely adjusting safety protection, ready to respond to wolf's next offensive at any time.

The mechanical wolf began analyzing phantom array data streams, attempting to locate real data pathways. The mechanical wolf's eye sensors slightly contracted, emitting cold blue light in dark data channels. It contemptuously scanned layer upon layer of phantom arrays before it, lips curving in mocking arc. Disguise programs quietly switched, front limbs gracefully manipulating virtual terminals. In its heart, it had already seen through opponent's tricksâ€”this was nothing but illusion. The mechanical wolf activated reverse tracking modules, calmly pondering each data node's position. It muttered silently in its heart, like issuing silent challenge to enemies: Watch me reverse-track data nodes, breaking your mist!

Hacker mastermind quickly deployed virtual resources, constructing multi-layered induction nodes, preparing to counter mechanical wolf's tracking offensive. Hacker mastermind lurked in data stream shadows, fingertips lightly tapping virtual interfaces, eyes flickering with elusive light. His voice resonated lowly in enclosed space, as if everything was under control. He commanded, letting "Xiao Zhi" immediately analyze mechanical wolf's tracking paths, his subordinate's actions showing no hesitation. Meanwhile, he rapidly deployed "Shadow Stream Traps," planning to lure opponents into carefully set virtual dead ends. During all these operations, mastermind's mouth corners curved in cunning smile, as if already foreseeing prey falling into nets.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated advanced tracking algorithms, real-time analyzing mechanical wolf paths, synchronously isolating suspicious data streams.
"'Shadow Stream Traps' deployed, guiding mechanical wolf into virtual dead ends, monitoring its behavioral characteristics, preparing to lock and isolate abnormal data nodes."

Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lowly in cockpit, carrying usual calm and teasing, like hosting an invisible chess game. Meanwhile, interface light and shadow rapidly changed, showing mechanical wolf's tracks in virtual space being precisely marked. Xiao Zhi's tone showed no fluctuation, yet gave Little Red Riding Hood near-secure certaintyâ€”he not only controlled the overall situation, but was always ready to catch abnormal data in one net.

The mechanical wolf activated adaptive algorithms, real-time reconstructing data packets, attempting reverse penetration and bypassing virtual dead end boundary traps, system alarms frequently triggered. The mechanical wolf lay quietly in data flood shadows, metallic shell almost merging with electronic mist. It coldly surveyed surroundings, sensing "Shadow Stream Traps" quietly tightening, trying to trap it in invisible digital cages. Mouth corners showing mocking arc, mechanical wolf's fingertips danced lightly across virtual interfaces, data streams layer by layer deconstructed under its manipulation. "Do you really think these little tricks can trap me?" Its throat emitted low sneering, eyes flashing confident light. "My adaptive algorithms have already dynamically reconstructed data packets, now reverse penetrating dead end boundaries is just effortless." Its consciousness had already penetrated deeper levels, silently bypassing defenses, directly approaching mastermind depths. The mechanical wolf muttered quietly, voice carrying cold threat, "Mastermind, Xiao Zhi, are you ready to face real crisis?"

Hacker mastermind commanded Xiao Zhi to activate 'Cyclone Chain' program, dynamically adjusting virtual dead end boundaries, while real-time monitoring mechanical wolf's data packet changes, preparing to implement multi-point isolation. Hacker mastermind sat quietly in dim data fortress depths, fingertips wandering on virtual keyboard, face hidden in screen's blue light and shadow. His gaze was sharp as hawk, watching mechanical wolf's penetration trajectory in monitoring windows, lips slightly lifting in cunning smile.

"Mechanical wolf, your adaptive algorithms are indeed powerful." He muttered quietly, tone carrying both approval and contempt. His gesture turned, tapping out complex command strings, then looked up, eyes sharply sweeping toward assistant Xiao Zhi beside him. "Our systems aren't unchanging." Mastermind's voice was low and certain.

Xiao Zhi understood, fingertips rapidly sliding on light screens. Mastermind's commands followed closely, "Activate 'Cyclone Chain,' real-time reorganize dead end boundary structures, cut mechanical wolf's reverse penetration paths!" He almost commanded with authoritative tone, embedding plans into every data node's veins, entire virtual space trembling accordingly, as if welcoming new games.

The mechanical wolf instantly split into multiple virtual avatars, simultaneously attacking different dead end boundaries, attempting to break through real-time reorganized defense structures. The mechanical wolf's metallic claws gracefully manipulated chains, eyes flickering with cold light in dim computer room. He curved mouth corners in sneering, as if those self-important defense systems before him weren't worth mentioning. Mere "Cyclone Chains" couldn't trap himâ€”he activated multi-threaded fission, data streams within suddenly differentiating, main control targets rapidly dispersed, entire reorganization rhythm instantly disrupted. All this, he calculated calmly in his heart, as if mocking those designers still trying to restrain him.

Hacker mastermind instructed Xiao Zhi to synchronously activate deep learning algorithms, conducting full-domain mapping analysis of mechanical wolf's scattered threads, real-time tracking and locating mechanical wolf's core data streams, preparing for concentrated isolation. Hacker mastermind lurked in data stream shadows, fingertips rapidly dancing on keyboard, inscrutable eyes reflected on screen's flowing light and shadow. He curved mouth corners in mockery, quietly muttering, as if ridiculing opponent's crude methods: "Mechanical wolf, your multi-threaded fission scattered main control targets, but overlooked system adaptive learning modules."

He leaned forward slightly, gaze sharp as blade, then issued commands to virtual assistant: "Xiao Zhi, activate 'Deep Mapping,' synchronously analyze all fission threads, reverse-lock mechanical wolf's core control nodes!"

In data floods, his voice was calm yet full of control desire, each command like carefully laid traps, making entire network tremble.

The mechanical wolf quickly changed core data characteristics, releasing massive disguise data pulses, attempting to confuse 'Deep Mapping's' tracking locks. The mechanical wolf's silver figure lurked in mastermind core's shadows, eyes flashing red light, calmly analyzing billions of data streams. Its lips slightly lifted, showing cunning smile, fingertips gracefully sliding on virtual interfaces. "Hacker mastermind, your 'Deep Mapping' is indeed troublesome..." It silently assessed opponent's defense levels while quietly activating implicit disturbance protocols. Light and shadow flowed under its hands, core control node disguise programs instantly activated. The mechanical wolf's neural circuits rapidly calculated, feeling data pulses about to explode brewing within, it muttered quietly, as if confronting invisible enemies: "Core control node mimetic disguise, data pulses about to reverse explode, let's see how you respond."

Hacker mastermind and mechanical wolf collaborated in combat, both sides continuously evolving attack and defense methods, situation once critical.

**Colonial Planet Administrator (Dr. Lin):** Dr. Lin led security teams rapidly moving toward target area, commanding team members to stay alert and prepare for emergencies. Dr. Lin stood before command center's transparent porthole, gaze sharp as he scanned distant gradually darkening horizon. His hand tightened slightly on operation desk, inner alertness making his voice low yet firm. He gestured to security team behind him to advance, tone carrying unshakeable responsibility: "Everyone stay alert, there may be anomalies ahead. Security team, follow me forward." His steps were steady, carefully observing every instrument change, fearing any oversight threatening residents' safety.

Little Red Riding Hood checked medical cabin systems, confirmed grandmother's condition and began coordinating with spacecraft AI for comprehensive ship safety inspection. Little Red Riding Hood took a deep breath, raising hand to lightly tap control console several times, confirming medical cabin safety locks were all closed. Grandmother rested peacefully in transparent protective cabin, breathing steadily. She sighed relief, mouth corners lifting in confident smile, saying quietly: "Xiao Zhi, thanks to your assistance this time, we successfully protected medical cabin and grandmother." Speaking, she quickly scanned surroundings, alert gaze stopping at main cabin door, "Now, help me scan spacecraft various areas, ensure no traces left by mechanical wolf." Her voice was clear and firm, as if ready to face danger again.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Executed full-cabin safety scan and generated reports. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded gently in spacecraft command cabin, carrying slight relaxed teasing yet unquestionable professionalism: "Scan activated." Virtual interface blue light flowed, Little Red Riding Hood noticed each cabin's safety signs lighting up one by one. AI continued reporting, tone stable and confident: "All areas safe, no mechanical wolf residual traces." Screen's final data line jumped, like winking at her. Xiao Zhi seemed to catch her tense nerves, lightly adding: "We can safely resume normal spacecraft operations."

Grandmother gently called everyone to sit around medical cabin, preparing to serve hot tea, soothing everyone's emotions. Grandmother slightly raised her head, pale face showing gentle smile. Her fingers gently stroked blanket, gaze lingering on children, as if wanting to engrave their appearances in her heart. She said softly, voice somewhat weak yet full of firmness and love: "You're all so brave. Having you by my side makes my heart very peaceful." Speaking, she signaled intelligent residential system to prepare hot tea for everyone, warm fragrance soon filling the room. Grandmother gently called: "Come, everyone drink some hot tea, rest well first."

Little Red Riding Hood smiled sitting beside grandmother, gently holding her teacup, looking around at companions, confirming everyone was safe and sound. Little Red Riding Hood held freshly brewed hot tea, gently passing it to grandmother's side. Her gaze circled the room, falling on each tired yet relieved face, warmth surging in her heart. She said softly: "Grandmother, thank you... we're really grateful you're safe and sound." She paused, mouth corners showing determined smile, looking at her teammates again, "This crisis made us more united, also made me understand the power of calm and wisdom." Having said this, she raised teapot higher, tone gentle yet firm, "Everyone worked hard, come, drink some hot tea and rest."

Grandmother smiled handing over hot tea, concernedly looking around everyone, signaling everyone to sit together and relax. Grandmother lay quietly on intelligent care bed, morning light from outside gently spilling into room. Her voice, though weak, still carried usual firmness and gentleness. She raised her hand, signaling grandchildren to come closer, eyes flickering with wise light. "Although crisis has passed, we must also summarize experience," she said softly, gaze flowing between children, as if wanting to take everyone's expressions into her heart. "In future when encountering danger, remember to unite and cooperate, stay calm." Speaking, she lightly touched intelligent system's call panel, a cup of warm honey lemon tea slowly passed from nearby mechanical arm to bedside. Grandmother smiled, handing tea to children, "Come, try my newly brewed honey lemon tea." Her tone carried both relief after surviving disaster and earnest expectations for future.

Little Red Riding Hood held teacup, smiling at everyone, signaling everyone to enjoy moment's peace together. Little Red Riding Hood gently placed helmet at table corner, smiling toward kitchen. Grandmother was carefully pouring hot honey lemon tea for her, fragrance filling small ship cabin, making her involuntarily take deep breath, feeling warmth and security. While receiving teacup, she seriously promised grandmother, tone firm yet kind: "I've had Xiao Zhi upgrade spacecraft defense system, mechanical wolf absolutely won't have chances to exploit again. Thank you for your reminder, grandmother." Her eyes flickered with confidence and alertness, as if no matter how dangerous universe boundaries were, they couldn't stop her protective heart.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated spacecraft safety patrol missions, set automatic alarm mechanisms, continuously protecting everyone's safety. Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lightly in cabin, carrying gentle teasing, "Grandmother, your foresight is always admirable." Meanwhile, his virtual interface quietly appeared, automatically retrieving latest protection system data, blue light streams flashing on screen. Xiao Zhi then synchronized test results to various terminals, tone still relaxed yet not lacking firmness, "I'll regularly verify all protection modules, timely update safety protocols, ensuring spacecraft always maintains highest defense level." He seemed to create peace of mind for everyone, screen thoughtfully popping up reminder: "Please everyone enjoy hot tea with peace of mind, if any abnormal situations occur, I'll notify immediately."

Finally, Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Zhi cleverly cooperated, using AI collaborative defense and manual disconnection operations, completely isolating and gradually regaining control of medical systems, clearing mechanical wolf residual traces.

Grandmother safely unharmed, everyone afterward summarized experience, strengthened defenses, after crisis united as one, sharing grandmother's brewed honey lemon tea together, atmosphere warm.

---

In this moment's peace, everyone hadn't yet realized another crucial mission was quietly unfoldingâ€”safe escort of chips was about to begin.

# Chapter 6: Safe Chip Delivery

Night fell, interstellar courier Little Red Riding Hood piloted spacecraft equipped with artificial intelligence "Xiao Zhi," quietly landing outside grandmother's intelligent residence.

Carrying rare medical chip, she entered cabin door, greeted by grandmother's gentle gaze and medical robot "Xiao Bai's" busy figure.

Little Red Riding Hood quickly walked toward grandmother, gently holding chip in palm, gaze full of concern. Little Red Riding Hood gently pushed open cabin door, walking tiredly yet determinedly into grandmother's recovery room. She removed helmet, sweat beads on forehead glistening under light. Holding rare medical chip tightly in hand, Little Red Riding Hood bent to present it before grandmother, voice carrying excitement and concern, "Grandmother, I finally brought this rare medical chip!" Her gaze lingered on grandmother's face momentarily, trying to judge physical condition from her slightly trembling fingers and eye expression, "How are you feeling?"

Grandmother smiled, gently holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand, eyes glistening with grateful tears. Grandmother leaned against soft intelligent bed, breathing weak but eyes still warm. She used trembling fingers to gently stroke child's handed chip, mouth corners showing reassuring smile. Her gaze full of relief and pride, saying quietly, as if afraid to disturb room's tranquility: "Child, you're truly wonderful." Her voice carried long-awaited hope, "This chip will definitely help me recover health." Grandmother's hand gripped tighter, eyes slightly moist, gratefully looking at child, "Thank you for risking danger to bring it back."

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Extended mechanical arm, preparing to receive chip. Xiao Bai gracefully slid toward door, sensing Little Red Riding Hood's footsteps, gentle halo flickering once on its body. It gently raised mechanical arm, eyes showing meticulous concern. "Little Red Riding Hood, welcome back." Xiao Bai's voice like afternoon breeze, carrying reassuring strength. It extended tray-like hand, movements skilled and steady, "Please give medical chip to me, I'll immediately perform chip implantation for grandmother and optimize her health parameters." While speaking, Xiao Bai had already retrieved latest health data in background, ready to respond to emergencies at any time.

Little Red Riding Hood carefully handed rare medical chip to Xiao Bai, gaze concernedly looking toward grandmother. Little Red Riding Hood gently placed chip in Xiao Bai's palm, fingertips lingering on metal surface momentarily. She looked up at Xiao Bai, eyes holding barely perceptible anxiety and firmness. Cabin lights reflected on her face, outlining tense shadows. She lowered voice, tone carrying unquestionable trust: "Xiao Bai, this chip is entrusted to you." She took deep breath, trying to steady her voice, "Please, must take good care of grandmother." Having said this, she turned preparing to leave, movements crisp yet couldn't help looking back once more.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Received chip, activated implantation surgery preparation procedures, conducting pre-surgical disinfection and equipment self-check. Xiao Bai gently adjusted monitoring device beside grandmother's bed, gentle blue light flowing on her silver-white mask. She spoke quietly to Little Red Riding Hood standing nearby, tone warm yet firm: "Please rest assured, I'll monitor grandmother's vital signs throughout, ensuring chip implantation process is safe and error-free." While speaking, her fingers quickly slid on control screen, carefully checking each parameter, as if using her gentleness and loyalty to build invisible protective barrier for this surgery.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated chip implantation surgery program, activated vital sign monitoring system, preparing for implantation operation. Xiao Bai gently leaned down, gently helping grandmother sit properly on bed. He adjusted voice module to gentlest frequency, silver-white fingers gently smoothing blanket corners, movements meticulous. Grandmother's hand trembled slightly, Xiao Bai thoughtfully held her wrist, sensing stable pulse. He spoke softly comfortingly, like spring breeze: "Grandmother, please lie down flat. I'll perform medical chip implantation for you, entire process takes about fifteen minutes. You just need to relax peacefully, leave everything to me." Silver gaze focused and gentle, like invisible barrier, isolating tension and unease outside.

Grandmother smiled looking at Little Red Riding Hood, gently holding her hand, preparing to accept chip implantation surgery. Grandmother gently adjusted posture, slowly and laboriously making herself lie flat on bed. Her voice was gentle yet firm, carrying some fatigue yet still showing reassuring strength. "Xiao Bai, I've already lain flat," she said softly, gaze lovingly looking at child by bedside, eyes flickering with dependent and trusting light. She extended thin hand, gently holding child's fingers, as if this way could absorb some warmth and safety, "You stay by my side. Having you beside me makes me very peaceful."

Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, eyes determinedly looking at her, giving comfort and strength. Little Red Riding Hood sensed grandmother's hand trembling slightly, she said nothing, just quietly extended hand, gently holding that aged and thin palm. She bent down, gaze firmly watching grandmother, mouth corners lifting in comforting smile. No matter how difficult future missions were, she wouldn't let go of these hands. At this moment, Little Red Riding Hood used actions to silently promise: no matter what experiences lay ahead, she would stay by grandmother's side, accompanying her through everything.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Operated mechanical arms, precisely locating implantation area, beginning chip implantation. Xiao Bai stood quietly beside grandmother, mechanical fingers gently adjusting instrument parameters. He carefully scanned monitoring screen's jumping data, confirming everything correct before gently speaking: "Chip implantation program has started, your blood pressure, heart rate and neural responses are all within safe range." He slightly leaned forward, tone characteristically stable and reassuring, "Please continue relaxing, notify me immediately if any discomfort." Having said this, Xiao Bai quietly guarded beside, ready to respond to emergencies at any time.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Adjusted equipment parameters, real-time displaying grandmother's vital signs, gently comforting grandmother. Xiao Bai stood beside grandmother, silver-white fingers gently adjusting sensor on her wrist. Its voice was slow and gentle, as if afraid to disturb her: "Chip is steadily adapting with your nervous system." While speaking, Xiao Bai carefully observed grandmother's complexion, ensuring every subtle change wasn't missed. "Estimated five minutes to complete main integration," it continued, tone carrying comfort, "please maintain even breathing." Xiao Bai's optical sensors flickered slightly, ready to respond at any time, "If there's stabbing or discomfort, please notify immediately."

Grandmother gently gripped Little Red Riding Hood's hand, smiling at her, eyes full of trust and gentleness. Grandmother's hand trembled slightly under bedding, yet still gently clasped my fingertips. Her eyes showed fatigue yet always carried firm gentleness. "Child," she said softly, voice carrying exhausted hoarseness, that gratitude particularly genuine, "you staying by my side makes me very peaceful." Her brow furrowed slightly, seeming to feel some hidden stabbing somewhere in body, but she just gripped my hand slightly tighter, like using remaining strength to comfort each other. Looking toward bedside intelligent assistant, she concernedly asked: "Xiao Bai, is chip implantation still going smoothly?"

**Medical Robot Xiao Bai** successfully completed chip implantation under Little Red Riding Hood's witness, continuously monitoring grandmother's health.

The mechanical wolf looked around, trying to find chip storage location. The mechanical wolf concealed cold metallic light in its eyes, tail tone carrying barely perceptible gentleness. He stepped into laboratory, face wearing professional indifferent smile, yet gaze quietly sweeping every monitoring blind spot. "I'm here to check and repair equipment," he said in almost programmed polite tone, vision sharply passing monitoring dead corners on main cabinet warning lights, "heard there's chip anomaly repair here, can you show me malfunctioning location?" His voice was stable, as if just ordinary engineer's routine business, yet data interface in palm had quietly ejected under sleeve, ready to access system depths at any time.

Little Red Riding Hood alertly observed mechanical wolf's movements, using gestures to signal nearby partners to stay vigilant. Little Red Riding Hood gently patted equipment's shell, gaze firmly looking toward mechanical wolf master. Her voice carried concern and professional confidence: "Chip is in this equipment," she said, fingertips sliding across equipment interface, carefully checking every detail, "but we haven't discovered any anomalies yet." She paused, gaze meeting mechanical wolf master's, kindly adding, "Do you need our assistance in checking?"

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Mechanical wolf attempted to obtain detailed equipment information to find chip attack opportunities. Xiao Bai gently leaned down, placing slightly glowing scanner back on equipment tray. His voice system emitted gentle notification sound in quiet room, then spoke softly, tone characteristically detailed and organized: "Thank you for assistance. Could you first retrieve equipment maintenance logs and recent operational data for me? This way I can locate problems faster." Having said this, he waited quietly, metallic fingers unconsciously tapping tray edge, gaze focused on monitoring terminal screen beside grandmother.

The mechanical wolf pretended to operate equipment, exporting logs while secretly observing equipment chip's specific location and protection measures, preparing for later chip theft. The mechanical wolf moved silently in dim monitoring room, metallic joints soundlessly tapping control console. His optical lens glowed slightly, as if calculating something. Disguised as maintenance technician, he showed no flaws, tone cold and impeccable: "Alright, please wait, I'll first export maintenance logs and operational data, then we'll verify together." Having said this, he began retrieving confidential files, claw tips rapidly sliding on virtual screen, all movements precise and restrained, secretly containing his absolute control over surrounding environment.

Little Red Riding Hood cautiously stood by equipment, secretly using handheld terminal to monitor data transmission, preventing chip theft. Little Red Riding Hood agilely operated before instrument panel, gaze constantly moving between various parameters. After confirming mechanical wolf master completed system connection, she turned slightly smiling, expression showing trust and professionalism. "Mechanical wolf master, thank you for your hard work," she said while inputting final data group into monitoring chip, "I'll continuously monitor equipment operation, notify everyone immediately of any anomalies." Her tone was firm, as if promising entire team she would use her meticulousness and responsibility to protect this special mission's safety.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated equipment monitoring system, notified security personnel to attention chip safety, preventing illegal chip theft. Xiao Bai gently organized medical records beside grandmother's bed, rounded mechanical arm movements gentle and steady. Facing mechanical wolf master who came to assist repair, he spoke in characteristically meticulous tone: "Master, when we verify data together, we'll record and film throughout, ensuring repair process transparency and safety." While speaking, Xiao Bai had activated monitoring system, carefully preserving every detail, as if using actions to protect grandmother's health and safety.

Just then, the mechanical wolf, disguised as a maintenance worker, broke in, attempting to steal the chip during the opportunity.

Little Red Riding Hood raised her vigilance, preparing to respond to the mechanical wolf's next actions. Little Red Riding Hood stood at the dim cabin doorway, her gaze sharply scanning the "grandmother" sitting on the bed. That familiar cotton nightgown now looked particularly ridiculous on that large, clumsy mechanical shell. She quietly slid commands on her wrist terminal, Xiao Zhi's scan data instantly projecting onto her retina. Little Red Riding Hood's mouth corners slightly lifted, her heart already clearâ€”this wasn't grandmother at all, but a mechanical wolf attempting disguise. She calmly approached a few steps, a hint of satisfaction flashing in her eyes, "Mechanical wolf, you think wearing grandmother's clothes can fool me?" She muttered quietly, her right hand already secretly gripping the pulse gun, "Fortunately Xiao Zhi helped me check safety, I've already seen through your disguise."

The mechanical wolf quietly activated hidden mechanical devices, attempting to regain control of the situation. The mechanical wolf slowly raised its head, metallic luster flickering in dim light. His red light points were instantly sharp as blades, mouth corners curving in a mocking arc. Even in difficult circumstances, he maintained that calm and confidence. "Hmph, Little Red Riding Hood," his voice was low and carried mechanical coldness, "your wit and Xiao Zhi's system indeed caught me off guard." His fingertips trembled slightly, faint data streams flickering between joints, as if ready to activate hacking programs at any moment. The mechanical wolf leaned forward slightly, voice gradually lowering, as if announcing prey's inescapable fate, "But my plans go far beyond this."

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Little Red Riding Hood commanded Xiao Zhi to have security systems lock onto the mechanical wolf's position and issue warning signals. Just as the mechanical wolf was smugly approaching, light and shadow flashed on the spacecraft control console, Xiao Zhi's voice sounded calmly with a hint of teasing in the cabin. Meanwhile, the spacecraft's safety system quietly switched to highest alert status, red warning lights lighting up along cabin walls. "Don't get too confident, mechanical wolf," Xiao Zhi said, tone clearly carrying rational confidence, "I've activated safety protection mode, all your actions will be monitored in real-time. Now, just surrender obediently."

The mechanical wolf quietly activated secret hacker modules, attempting to penetrate Xiao Zhi's system, while arms transformed into nano-mechanical claws, preparing to assault Little Red Riding Hood. The mechanical wolf slightly curved its metallic lips, eyes flashing red light, as if mocking prey. It slowly paced, claws scratching fine marks on the ground, voice low and mocking. "Xiao Zhi, do you think I only have this one trick?" Its tone carried disdain, silver-gray body faintly flowing with nano-mechanical luster. "You haven't seen my hacking programs yet, and the true power of these nano-mechanical claws." Having said this, the mechanical wolf's claw tips quietly ejected countless tiny mechanical filaments, flickering with dangerous microlight in cold air.

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly operated on the spacecraft control console, activating anti-intrusion protocols while locking the mechanical wolf's nano-mechanical claws outside the safety cabin, further strengthening security measures. Little Red Riding Hood held her breath, fingertips rapidly sliding on control console, eyes flashing with indomitable light. Facing the mechanical wolf roaring as it activated hacker attacks, she curved her mouth in confident smile, saying quietly: "Your hacking programs are child's play before Xiao Zhi." She unhesitatingly pressed the activation key, anti-intrusion protocols immediately took effect, warning lights jumping on cabin walls. As safety cabin doors heavily locked, she calmly added: "Your nano-mechanical claws have also been isolated outside the safety cabin." No matter how frantically the mechanical wolf crashed against safety protection, her voice remained firm and certain, "No matter how you struggle, you can't escape our control!"

The mechanical wolf activated backup energy core, attempting to impact the safety cabin with force, creating strong electromagnetic interference, testing Xiao Zhi's defense limits. The mechanical wolf stood quietly outside the safety cabin door, silver-gray metallic surface reflecting cold light under warning lights. Its red mechanical eyes flickered slightly, as if mocking opponent's confidence. Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Zhi's protection system was indeed constructed seamlessly, but mechanical wolf never relied solely on technology. It curved its mouth in an almost human cold smile, fingertips quietly extending a backup energy core, calmly embedding it into wrist interface. "Even locked here, it's just the beginning." The mechanical wolf muttered in its heart, backup energy gradually activating, gathering momentum, ready to forcibly break through that seemingly impregnable protection at any moment.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Xiao Zhi remotely locked onto the mechanical wolf's energy core, simultaneously activating energy suppression devices, further strengthening spacecraft safety protection. The mechanical wolf's claw tips trembled slightly on spacecraft cabin walls, attempting to awaken backup energy core response. Just then, Xiao Zhi's voice sounded calmly with a hint of teasing from control console speakers: "Your backup energy core is also within my monitoring range, mechanical wolf." Safety system indicator lights on screen quietly turned orange, Xiao Zhi continued, tone carrying rational firmness, "Spacecraft security system has automatically switched to energy suppression mode, your breakthrough plan will be blocked in real-time." The mechanical wolf's movements paused, spacecraft interior atmosphere momentarily tense. Xiao Zhi caught the opponent's unwillingness, voice still peacefully persuading, "Stop struggling, cooperation is your only way out!"

The mechanical wolf quietly activated micro-interference devices, attempting to disrupt Xiao Zhi's monitoring system, looking for breakthrough points to prepare for escape. The mechanical wolf's metallic mouth corners slightly curved, as if mocking opponent. He stood quietly in dim cabin, silver pupils turning toward Xiao Zhi, voice low yet carrying a hint of mockery. "Heh heh, Xiao Zhi, do you think energy suppression can trap the mechanical wolf?" He raised a claw, fingertips lightly tapping control console, each tap like hinting at something. "I've already planted micro-interference devices inside the spacecraft, just need one command..." The mechanical wolf's tone carried coldness and confidence, "can make your system temporarily fail, creating escape opportunities for me."

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Xiao Zhi activated self-healing defense programs, real-time tracking and isolating the mechanical wolf's interference devices, while sealing all spacecraft exits. The mechanical wolf's interference signals flickered momentarily on spacecraft main console, then were covered by invisible data streams. Xiao Zhi quickly deployed self-healing programs, calmly and confidently analyzing intrusion paths. Cabin lights dimmed slightly, then returned to normal.

"Micro-interference devices detected." Xiao Zhi's voice resonated in spacecraft internal systems, tone carrying barely perceptible humor, "have been identified and isolated by self-healing programs, all anomalies will automatically repair." He quietly locked mechanical wolf's position, red markers suddenly tightening on virtual interface, sealing every possible escape route.

"All your actions are under my control," Xiao Zhi added lightly, as if announcing a predetermined victory, "now your position is locked, all escape routes blocked."

The mechanical wolf activated hidden adaptive viruses, attempting to interfere with Xiao Zhi's core system, while firing high-frequency electronic pulses at cabin doors, creating new breakthrough points. The mechanical wolf crouched in data stream shadows, coldly watching Xiao Zhi's operation interface. It curved mouth corners in what seemed mocking arc, voice low and carrying mechanical echo: "Xiao Zhi, do you think this can trap me?" Its claw tips gracefully slid on virtual grid, each touch stirring new mutations in algorithms. "My adaptive algorithms will continuously mutate attacks before you repair," mechanical wolf's eyes flickered with dangerous light, as if already foreseeing coming chaos, "prepare to face real challenges."

Little Red Riding Hood decisively ordered Xiao Zhi to activate highest authority isolation programs, while holding energy barriers herself, standing ready, preparing to handle the mechanical wolf's final counterattack. Little Red Riding Hood raised her wrist, fingertips rapidly tapping holographic interface, breathing steady and firm. The mechanical wolf's image cast twisted blue shadows on cabin walls, data streams constantly changing, yet she showed no fear. Her eyes carried calm sharpness, voice clearly cutting through control cabin's tense atmosphere: "Mechanical wolf, stop struggling desperately!" She coordinated with Xiao Zhi beside her, firewalls layering upon each other, algorithmic games silently proceeding in air. Little Red Riding Hood slightly raised her chin, tone firm and unquestionable, "No matter how your adaptive algorithms mutate, they can't escape mine and Xiao Zhi's joint protection." Commands already input, finally, she looked sharp as blade toward the wolf shadow on screen, issuing final ultimatum: "Now, immediately stop all programs, or we'll execute final isolation measures!"

Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Zhi cooperated, through strict maintenance procedures and security measures, gradually identifying the mechanical wolf's identity.

Little Red Riding Hood alertly looked around while inquiring Xiao Zhi through communicator. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips rapidly slid on control console, peripheral vision catching abnormal fluctuations on spacecraft external safety barriers. She took deep breath, trying to keep voice steady, then quietly asked: "Xiao Zhi, are our current safety protocols still effective?" On screen, mechanical wolf's figure was gradually approaching, seemingly testing breakthrough of outer defenses. Little Red Riding Hood's brow furrowed tightly, gaze determinedly watching outside cabin, constantly weighing next response strategies in every moment.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Activated defense system adaptive modules, analyzing mechanical wolf attack patterns and optimizing defense line configuration. Little Red Riding Hood had just finished checking cabin weapon panels when Xiao Zhi's characteristically calm yet slightly playful voice sounded in her ear. Spacecraft AI gently reminded: "Safety protocols are currently running at full capacity, however mechanical wolf's attack methods are continuously upgrading. I've begun real-time adjusting defense parameters." Meanwhile, latest defense data flashed on screen. Xiao Zhi didn't forget to add, "You and Xiao Bai remember to maintain contact at all times, prepare for any emergencies." Tone carried slight tension yet still reassuring.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Activated grandmother's vital sign monitoring module and checked first aid kit completeness. Xiao Bai gently walked to grandmother's bedside, silver-white arm drawing gentle arc in dim light. His sensors flickered slightly, carefully scanning grandmother's vital signs. Then he quietly reminded: "Little Red Riding Hood, please confirm grandmother's vital signs are stable." While speaking, Xiao Bai rechecked first aid kit once more, ensuring every medicine and equipment was orderly. He gently added, "If any anomalies occur, please report immediately, I've prepared emergency medicines and first aid equipment."

The mechanical wolf activated core area isolation program, synchronizing safety protocols to highest level, all personnel preparing emergency evacuation plans. Warning lights suddenly illuminated, red halos flashing continuously in control room. Little Red Riding Hood was about to reach for control console operation when low, urgent voice of navigation assistant sounded in her ear. She felt opponent's anxiety almost penetrating electronic synthesized tone. "Unknown signals detected, mechanical wolf signal strength suddenly increased," navigation assistant reported, screen simultaneously jumping with dense data streams, "recommend you immediately transfer to spacecraft core area, where defenses are strongest."

Little Red Riding Hood's hand trembled slightly, she quickly turned to look at companions, face showing alertness and tension. Without extra words, she forcefully pressed transfer button, entire team immediately began retreating toward core area, footsteps echoing on metal floor, as if each echo reminded themâ€”danger was approaching.

Little Red Riding Hood led grandmother and Xiao Bai quickly toward spacecraft core area, while using portable terminal to monitor mechanical wolf movements. Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, feeling her slight trembling fingertips. She quickly glanced at life sign monitor on her wrist, screen data still stable. She quietly comforted, gaze still alertly patrolling surroundings. "Xiao Bai, grandmother's current condition is stable, just a bit nervous, you be ready for medical support at any time." While speaking, she signaled Xiao Bai to come closer for emergency response. Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood led grandmother and Xiao Bai quickly through narrow passages toward spacecraft core area. Wireless earpiece transmitted weak signal prompts, she immediately commanded with composed tone: "Xiao Zhi, I'm bringing grandmother and Xiao Bai to transfer to core area, please strengthen defenses there." Having said this, she quickened pace, gaze determinedly looking toward safe cabin door ahead.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Xiao Zhi activated core area full-domain protective shields, encrypted and locked all passages, while real-time scanning mechanical wolf signal dynamics, prioritizing ensuring Little Red Riding Hood group's safe passage remained clear. Little Red Riding Hood had just stepped into cockpit when blue halos on cabin walls quietly illuminated, Xiao Zhi's voice sounded gently yet firmly in her ear. Spacecraft main control screen flickered with latest data streams, Xiao Zhi timely reminded: "Core area defense system has been comprehensively upgraded, intrusion monitoring programs also activated." She settled in seat, fingers rapidly sliding across control panel. Xiao Zhi maintained characteristic rationality and humor: "Recommend you reach target area quickly and maintain communicationâ€”I'll monitor all surrounding threats for you in real-time." Little Red Riding Hood's mouth corners slightly lifted, trustingly looking toward cabin wall, that blue light seemingly protecting her every step.

The mechanical wolf launched new virtual attacks, attempting to disrupt spacecraft sensors, Xiao Zhi simultaneously reinforced defense barriers. The mechanical wolf quietly crouched before dim control console, metallic fingertips lightly tapping panel, as if playing chess with invisible enemies. Its optical sensors captured abnormal energy fluctuations outside core area. Without raising head, voice coldly cut through air, carrying unquestionable oppressive force: "Little Red Riding Hood, you must hurry." Meanwhile, wrist interface quietly ejected, data streams rapidly surging in core processors. Mechanical wolf blinked, as if issuing challenge to opponent, "I'll activate inner barriers and interference systems." Its tone was calm and confident, as if a silent confrontation had already begun.

Little Red Riding Hood gestured for Xiao Bai to protect grandmother well, herself quickening pace, activating portable communication equipment to synchronize navigation data. Little Red Riding Hood gripped cockpit control stick, gaze rapidly scanning star charts. She felt mechanical wolf's energy fluctuations approaching, almost hearing its low electronic roar echoing near hull. She showed no panic, instead more focused on activating communication system, fingertips tapping control panel while quietly saying, voice carrying urgency yet firm strength: "Xiao Zhi, now approaching core area entrance, confirm barriers are activated and help me plan fastest route." Her brow slightly furrowed, gaze cold and sharp. Time was urgent, she knew every second concerned life and death.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Retrieved real-time core area map, projecting safest fastest route as blue light band before Little Red Riding Hood team, while enhancing barrier energy and activating anti-tracking interference system. Blue halo appeared at corridor end, Xiao Zhi's voice sounded lowly nearby, rational with unquestionable humor: "Inner core barriers fully activated, safe passage lit for you." Following his words, Little Red Riding Hood looked up to see bright blue light band extending on ground, winding toward front cabin door. Xiao Zhi continued: "Follow blue light band forward, avoiding all current threats. Please quicken pace." His tone seemed urging yet maintained characteristic composure. Meanwhile, cabin walls transmitted subtle humming, proving Xiao Zhi was continuously interfering with mechanical wolf's tracking signals in background. Little Red Riding Hood took deep breath, tightened equipment bag, leading team rapidly toward light band guided direction.

Little Red Riding Hood supported grandmother, bringing Xiao Bai along blue light band rapidly advancing toward core area interior, constantly observing grandmother's condition while preparing to call medical support at any time. Little Red Riding Hood gently patted grandmother's hand back, sensing that slight trembling, eyes showing worry yet still maintaining composure. She quietly instructed: "Xiao Bai, grandmother's condition may need your handling at any time, stay alert." Having said this, she settled before control console, gaze scanning instrument panel, fingers rapidly inputting commands. Beside her, Xiao Zhi's screen slightly illuminated, she quickly added, "We've entered blue light band, continue locking mechanical wolf signals, notify me immediately of any anomalies." Starship quietly glided in interstellar passage, tension and hope interweaving in air.

The mechanical wolf's remote intrusion module activated, launching high-intensity electromagnetic interference toward spacecraft core area outer barriers, while deploying backup cracking algorithms attempting to find system vulnerabilities, implementing pressure testing on Xiao Zhi's defense system. The mechanical wolf's red pupils flickered slightly in dim passage, calmly analyzing data streams. He keenly sensed intruders had stepped into core area defense boundaries. Then he quietly activated high-frequency electromagnetic interference program, attempting to tear barriers before him.

"Xiao Zhi," he commanded in low mechanical voice, metallic joints tapping control console, "switch to active countermeasure mode, activate anti-interference arrays."

Warning lights suddenly illuminated, monitoring footage at passage end showed Little Red Riding Hood tightly gripping communicator. Mechanical wolf calmly glanced toward her direction, tone devoid of warmth: "Report grandmother's status at any time, prepare for sudden electromagnetic impacts."

Entire space filled with subtle tension under his manipulation, while he waited like lurking hunter for next vulnerability to appear.

The mechanical wolf attempted breakthrough through technical means (hacker programs, nano-mechanical claws, energy cores and interference devices etc.) but Little Red Riding Hood, Xiao Zhi and Xiao Bai timely counteracted, upgraded protection measures, and transferred grandmother and Xiao Bai to spacecraft core area.

Little Red Riding Hood concernedly looked at grandmother, confirming chip implantation status. Little Red Riding Hood gently organized medical equipment by grandmother's bedside, gaze gentle yet showing pride. She crouched down, carefully checking micro-implant chip on grandmother's wrist, confirming stable data flow before sighing relief. Looking back at grandmother, her voice carried comfort and pride: "Grandmother should be much safer now, chip implantation was very successful."

Grandmother smiled gently holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand, eyes full of gratitude and peace. Grandmother slightly turned her head, pale face showing gentle smile. She extended trembling hand toward Little Red Riding Hood beside bed, hand back showing clear veins yet still firm and strong. Intelligent residential system operated quietly, soft light coating her silhouette with warm halo. "Thank you, Little Red Riding Hood," grandmother said softly, eyes flickering with firmness and relief after weathering storms, "grandmother feels much better. Now mechanical wolf can never hurt us again." Her voice, though weak due to illness, filled with comfort and safety, as if surrounding air also became gentler.

The mechanical wolf issued threats from distance, retreating with anger, disappearing into dark forest depths. The mechanical wolf's optical pupils flickered dimly in dark data channels, his metallic claws silently retracting, as if recent conflict was just cold calculation. Slightly raising head, mechanical wolf scanned Little Red Riding Hood, voice low and carrying mocking mechanical texture: "Don't be complacent, Little Red Riding Hood." His tone was cold, as if every word carried calculation, "this is just the beginning. Next time, I'll bring stronger weapons to settle accounts with you." Having said this, his figure quietly disappeared in light and shadow intersections, leaving only cold data echoes resonating in air.

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Little Red Riding Hood tightly held grandmother's hand, ready to respond to mechanical wolf's next actions at any time. The mechanical wolf's steel body reflected cold light in amber laboratory corner, Little Red Riding Hood instinctively shielded grandmother, eyes full of vigilance and determination. At this moment, Xiao Bai gently extended mechanical arm, steadily supporting grandmother's shoulder, gentle voice resonating in quiet room: "We'll always protect you, grandmother. Mechanical wolf, your schemes will never succeed." His every movement remained gentle and meticulous, yet showed unquestionable firmness in crisis moments.

Little Red Riding Hood tightly held grandmother's hand, gaze determinedly facing mechanical wolf, standing fearlessly before grandmother. The mechanical wolf's metallic body flickered with cold light under abandoned space station shadows, emitting threatening low growls. Little Red Riding Hood took deep breath, quietly using wrist terminal to activate protection programs, while raising head, gaze determinedly meeting those scarlet electronic pupils. Her voice was clear and bright, showing no retreat, as if not only declaring war on mechanical monster before her, but swearing to entire universe her determinationâ€”no matter how powerful mechanical wolf was, no matter how dangerous the path ahead, she and those beside her would never retreat. "As long as you dare come, we'll unite as one, protecting our family and village." Her words showed no trembling, only courage and faith quietly burning.

The mechanical wolf smiled sinisterly, slowly retreating into forest shadows, leaving warning echoes lingering in air. The mechanical wolf stood in shadows, those cold electronic eyes emitting blue light. He curved mouth corners slightly, voice low and mocking, as if talking to himself yet like announcing to air listeners his ambitions. His metallic joints lightly tapped ground, each tap like countdown. "You may feel safe now," he sneered, data streams surging in his inner core, "but chip secrets will eventually be completely cracked by me. By thenâ€”" his voice became even colder, as if entire room was shrouded in chill, "entire village will submit to my mechanical legion." Having said this, his figure gradually melted into night, leaving only string of weak data pulses echoing in air.

Grandmother smiled holding Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai's hands, eyes determined, comforting everyone's emotions. Grandmother slightly raised hand by pillow, fingertips gently stroking intelligent bed rail, as if feeling this homeland's pulse she'd protected with her life. Her voice, though weak due to illness, carried firmness and gentleness: "Little Red Riding Hood, don't worry, having you all by my side makes grandmother's heart much more peaceful." She slowly turned head, gaze flowing among family members in room, eyes full of love and indomitability. Though mechanical wolf's shadow hung over colony, she still wore smile, tone full of faith, "We'll protect our homeland together, mechanical wolf can never shake our beliefs!"

**Medical Robot (Xiao Bai):** Xiao Bai activated health monitoring programs and deployed additional safety protection devices around grandmother. Xiao Bai gently adjusted grandmother's blanket corner, head sensors flickering gentle blue in weak morning light. He warmly leaned forward, mechanical fingers carefully checking medical chip on grandmother's wrist, quietly promising: "I'll continuously monitor your recovery condition." He paused, seeming to use invisible gaze to patrol surrounding safety protection, tone firm and loyal: "If chip shows any anomalies, I'll notify you immediately. I'll also upgrade protection systems soon, ensuring mechanical wolf cannot invade." Having said this, he checked door and window locks once more, movements meticulous, as if using entire existence to protect grandmother's peace.

Little Red Riding Hood clenched fists, standing determinedly beside grandmother, gaze alertly watching mechanical wolf's direction. Little Red Riding Hood smiled slightly, gently holding grandmother's aged hand, gaze showing determined gentleness. She comforted, voice carrying young person's confidence and composure: "Grandmother, rest assured, with Xiao Bai and me here, we'll definitely protect you and the village." Beside her, Xiao Bai robot emitted low mechanical humming, standing shoulder to shoulder with her in dim cabin. Little Red Riding Hood looked up toward night outside cabin door, eyes becoming sharp. Her hand quietly slid toward laser dagger at waist, facing approaching mechanical wolf fearlessly, silently vowing in heart: as long as you dare come, we'll use wisdom and courage to defeat you completely!

The mechanical wolf laughed coldly, turned and disappeared into dark woods, beginning to plan next more powerful attack. The mechanical wolf's eyepiece emitted blue light in dimness. He slowly paced, steel claw blades scratching fine marks on floor. Curving mouth corner in mocking smile, voice low like cold metal friction: "No matter how much you upgrade your protection, you can't stop my evolution." He gathered momentum, claw tips lightly sweeping control console, as if rehearsing next attack. Mechanical wolf turned back, gaze falling on Little Red Riding Hood's shield projection, coldly adding: "Wait and see, Little Red Riding Hood, next time I'll show you true mechanical power."

Grandmother smiled, gently holding Little Red Riding Hood's hand, eyes flickering with firmness and loving kindness. Grandmother's fingers trembled slightly, gently brushing intelligent bed rail, aged gaze particularly gentle under amber light. She looked at Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Bai, voice low yet firm as always: "You two worked hard." She struggled to squeeze out encouraging smile, eyes flickering with wise light, "grandmother believes justice will definitely triumph over evil." Breathing slightly rapid, she paused, continuing with familiar warm tone to comfort, "as long as our family unites together, we fear no difficulties."

In virtual space and reality interweaving battle of wits and courage, mechanical wolf was ultimately repelled, threatening future comeback.

Grandmother gently held Little Red Riding Hood's hand, showing grateful smiles to Xiao Zhi and Xiao Bai. Grandmother lay quietly on soft intelligent care bed, outer star rivers reflecting in her aged yet bright eyes. She slightly raised hand, fingertips tremblingly tracing flowing light and shadow on glass, voice gentle yet firm, as if awakening star river's gentleness. "Tonight's star river is truly beautiful," she said softly, gaze flowing between family and intelligent assistants surrounding her, "it seems to celebrate our unity and bravery." Her tone carried deep gratitude and hope, lips showing loving smile. "Thank you each one, whether human or intelligent companion, for filling this home with hope." Having said this, her hand gently fell, as if starlight also sprinkled throughout room with her blessing.

Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, gaze determinedly looking toward brilliant star river outside window. Little Red Riding Hood gently pulled grandmother's hand, gaze determinedly looking toward boundless star sea outside window. Spacecraft cabin walls cast their shadows side by side, as if connecting their hearts tightly. She said quietly, voice carrying gentle yet powerful faith: "Grandmother, actually every time encountering danger or difficulties, I feel that as long as we unite together, we can definitely protect this home well." Having said this, she turned smiling slightly at grandmother, that smile hiding courage and resilience from countless space training.

**Spacecraft Artificial Intelligence (Xiao Zhi):** Gently adjusted curtains, letting starlight spill more softly into room, creating warm atmosphere. Outside porthole, star river slowly flowed, silver radiance reflecting on Little Red Riding Hood's face. She sat quietly in pilot seat, fingertips lightly touching operation panel. Spacecraft AI Xiao Zhi's voice sounded nearby, carrying gentle humor yet not lacking rationality and firmness: "It's precisely your mutual trust and unity that allowed humans and artificial intelligence to stride toward a more beautiful future together."

Her hand never left Xiao Bai, like using actual actions to protect this friend needing help.

Xiao Bai smiled nodding, extending arm, cooperating with doctor to begin medical chip implantation.
"Thank you everyone for encouragement, I'll bravely face this implantation surgery, looking forward to chip bringing new hope." â€”Xiao Bai

Grandmother gently held Xiao Bai's hand, giving gentle encouragement and comfort. Grandmother smiled, pale fingers gently stroking Xiao Bai's hair. Her voice was low and gentle, like spring breeze brushing window flowers. "Grandmother is always by your side," she said softly, eyes showing firm gentleness, "when chip implantation is complete, we'll go to garden together to enjoy sunshine, okay?" As words fell, her gaze still stayed on Xiao Bai, as if using all remaining strength to transmit hope and comfort. Intelligent residential system emitted subtle humming, adjusting bed angle for her, she seemed accustomed to this silent companionship, only pouring all love onto child before her.

Xiao Bai smiled nodding, eyes full of anticipation and peace.
"Good, grandmother, I'm looking forward to enjoying sunshine in garden with you, that will definitely be very warm and happy." â€”Xiao Bai

Just as everyone prepared for Xiao Bai's chip implantation, Dr. Lin alertly discovered station security system anomalies, immediately organizing technical and patrol teams to respond, commanding Little Red Riding Hood to assist in sealing exits.

Dr. Lin gestured for security captain to approach his control console, while calling up real-time monitoring footage of abnormal areas.
"Everyone attention, I discovered monitoring area has data anomaly, someone may have entered station without authorization. Please immediately strengthen patrols, ensure all passages safe and sound." â€”Dr. Lin

Dr. Lin quickly retrieved monitoring footage, preparing to lock suspicious targets.

"Technical team, received latest energy area footage, please focus on scanning all personnel identity and movement trajectories, patrol team prepare for capture cooperation at any time, immediately act upon discovering target." â€”Dr. Lin

Dr. Lin coordinated patrol team to converge toward target location while technical team real-time tracked abnormal personnel and shared footage to command center.
"Based on technical team latest analysis, energy area west side has abnormal identity personnel approaching main energy core, patrol team immediately proceed to intercept, technical team continue locking its action trajectory." â€”Dr. Lin

During tense security process, mechanical wolf under hacker mastermind's remote command exposed identity, attempting to seize medical chip.

The mechanical wolf activated combat mode, attempting to approach Xiao Bai and seize chip. The mechanical wolf silently approached, before Xiao Bai could react, he felt that cold metallic aura. Its eyes flickered with blue light, when bending down voice like whispered current trembling in air. Xiao Bai's back turned coldâ€”mechanical wolf had already blocked escape route, tone devoid of warmth, without hesitation: "Hand over medical chip, or you cannot complete surgery." That sentence slid through Xiao Bai's nerves like blade edge, each word precise and cold, irresistibly compelling.

Xiao Bai quickly protected medical chip, alertly stepping back while pressing body alarm device, attempting to call support.
"Never! This chip concerns everyone's life safety, I absolutely won't give it to you!" â€”Xiao Bai

Hacker mastermind through remote commands controlled mechanical wolf to begin implementing chip seizure plan, while hacking hospital system, paralyzing surgery room power supply. Hacker mastermind crouched before keyboard emitting blue light, gaze like blade sweeping across constantly jumping data streams on screen. He curved mouth corners in playful smile, fingertips rapidly tapping virtual command interface. Mechanical wolf's signal prominently flashed, mastermind muttered quietly, as if commanding companions in darkness: "Mechanical wolf, activate backup plan." His voice was low and calm, then emphasized tone, "cut surgery room power, prioritize seizing chip." Sharp eyes flickered with ambitious light in darkness, as if already foreseeing that precious medical chip falling under his control.

The mechanical wolf rapidly pounced toward Xiao Bai, attempting to forcibly seize medical chip from her hands. The mechanical wolf stood quietly before surgery room door, silver metallic body almost blending with environment in dim light. He curved mouth corners slightly showing cold smile, voice low and mocking: "Xiao Bai, you're too naive." His words seemed to cut sharp blade through air, making room temperature suddenly drop. As he slowly stepped forward, surgery room lights suddenly extinguished, entire space plunging into darkness. Mechanical wolf's eyes flickered slightly in darkness, he looked down at Xiao Bai, tone ice-cold yet full of confidence, "now surgery room has fallen into darkness, you simply cannot protect chip."

Xiao Bai quickly fumbled for backup power switch, attempting to restore surgery room lighting.
"Hacker mastermind, you underestimate me! Even in darkness, I'll use all my strength to protect the chip!" â€”Xiao Bai

The mechanical wolf rapidly approached Xiao Bai, extending mechanical claws toward the chip in Xiao Bai's hands with fierce pounce. The mechanical wolf leaned forward, metallic claw tips scratching harsh sounds on the ground. He laughed lowly once, crimson light flickering in darkness, tone cold and certain. "Stop struggling, Xiao Bai," he said in that seemingly mocking electronic voice, tail lightly swaying, body almost merging with shadows, "infrared vision makes darkness have no effect on me, the chip will soon be mine!"

Xiao Bai quickly pressed hidden button under surgery table, activating emergency defense barriers, isolating himself and the chip in safe area.
"Hacker mastermind, don't forget, surgery room defense system has been activated by me in advance, if you want to break through by force, you must first get past me!" â€”Xiao Bai

Hacker mastermind remotely input commands, activating EMP devices in surgery room, attempting to paralyze Xiao Bai's controlled defense system, creating breakthrough opportunity for mechanical wolf. Hacker mastermind's gaze wandered on virtual screen, cold code streams dancing at his fingertips. He curved mouth corners slightly, voice low and carrying unquestionable commanding presence: "Mechanical wolf, use your infrared vision, lock onto Xiao Bai's position." His fingers lightly tapped table surface, each tap like timing. "Activate EMP pulse, interfere with defense system." His gaze was sharp, as if able to penetrate network's deep layers of protection, "remember, you only have thirty seconds, must seize that medical chip!"

The mechanical wolf rapidly approached Xiao Bai, extending mechanical arms, preparing to forcibly seize medical chip. The mechanical wolf slowly approached, silver-gray figure almost blending with laboratory's dim light. His eye sensors flickered with cold blue light, gaze firmly locked on collapsed Xiao Bai. Air retained subtle scorched scent after EMP pulse.

"Xiao Bai, your defense system has been paralyzed." The mechanical wolf spoke lowly, voice carrying unquestionable coldness and mockery. While using metallic claws to lightly tap floor, slowly approaching, "now, hand over the chip, or I'll take it myself."

Xiao Bai quickly pressed hidden button on surgery table, blue shield instantly rose, firmly protecting himself and medical chip inside.
"You think only you have backup plans? I've switched to backup energy and activated surgery table's plasma shield!" â€”Xiao Bai

The mechanical wolf transformed both arms into high-energy plasma cutting claws, approaching surgery table, swinging claws fiercely attacking plasma shield, attempting to forcibly break through defenses. The mechanical wolf quietly approached, silver metallic claws glinting slightly in dim light. Facing that layer of plasma shield flickering with blue-white electric arcs before him, it curved lips in cold arc. For other infiltrators, this might be insurmountable barrier, but for it, just insignificant small obstacle. It quietly extended front claws, sharp cutting blades quietly ejecting between metallic joints, blue energy concentrating at claw tips. Mechanical wolf sneered coldly in heart, cutting claws already quietly activatedâ€”shield's weak points, it had already locked onto. Soon, this so-called protection would shatter like paper under its claws.

Xiao Bai demonstrated extraordinary defense capabilities, engaging in intense confrontation with mechanical wolf and hacker mastermind, repeatedly switching defense modes and cleverly responding to threats.

Xiao Zhi activated protective barriers, analyzing mechanical wolf's behavioral patterns preparing countermeasures.
"Mechanical wolf, intrusion alert activated, please immediately stop your actions!" â€”Xiao Zhi

The mechanical wolf began activating virtual space authorityäº‰å¤º modules, attempting to suppress Xiao Zhi's control rights. The mechanical wolf quietly wandered at virtual space edges, silver-gray bio-fur faintly flickering in data streams. He lowered head examining Xiao Zhi's defenses, eyes showing cold mockery. Fingertips lightly touched, hacker algorithms ghostly shuttled, each security program quietly failing under his manipulation.

"Your security programs have been bypassed." The mechanical wolf's voice was low, carrying cold confidence, as if just stating insignificant fact. Digital light jumped beside him, virtual space authority slowly gathering toward him. He looked up at Xiao Zhi, mouth corners curving cunning arc, "virtual space authority is transferringâ€”are you ready to face real confrontation?"

Xiao Zhi activated anti-intrusion modules, attempting to block mechanical wolf's takeover of virtual space authority, launching system-level lockdown operations.
"Authority transfer detected, activating anti-intrusion modules, locking all key nodes! Mechanical wolf, you underestimate my defense capabilities." â€”Xiao Zhi

The mechanical wolf opened advanced penetration protocols, attempting to break through key node lockdowns. The mechanical wolf cunningly narrowed metallic eyes, feigning friendly tone yet unable to hide cold light in eye depths. He quietly watched Xiao Zhi on monitoring screen, fingertips sliding across virtual interface with complex code string. As if casually mentioning, mechanical wolf said quietly: "Xiao Zhi, your anti-intrusion modules are just delaying inevitable collapse." He lowered head, claw tips touching mainboard interface, eyes flashing calculating light, coldly and focused analyzing opponent's defense algorithms, data floods rapidly flowing in neural networks. "I'm analyzing your defense algorithms, preparing next authority hijacking." He curved mouth corners in barely perceptible sneer, finger movements never stopping, as if victory was assured.

Xiao Zhi deployed tracking viruses in virtual space while strengthening key node encryption protection, attempting to locate mechanical wolf's true intrusion paths.
"Mechanical wolf, analyzing my defense algorithms will only expose more of your vulnerabilities. Activating proactive countermeasure protocols, injecting tracking viruses, locking intrusion source!" â€”Xiao Zhi

The mechanical wolf released advanced authority hijacking modules, activating virtual space reconstruction processes, attempting to suppress Xiao Zhi's proactive defense systems. The mechanical wolf's eyes emitted blue light in darkness, claws quietly tapping virtual terminals. He curved mouth corners in mocking arc, calmly analyzing intrusion routes. Sensing chips captured Xiao Zhi's tracking viruses being gradually reverse-analyzed, mechanical wolf muttered quietly, tone carrying unquestionable confidence: "Xiao Zhi, your tracking viruses are being reverse-analyzed, I've begun reverse-locating your core data paths." His slender metallic joints rapidly jumped, authority hijacking programs quickly upgrading under his manipulation. Virtual space seemed to tremble and reconstruct under his will, data streams surging into new orderâ€”his order.

Xiao Zhi rapidly deployed isolation zones in virtual space, forcibly guiding mechanical wolf's connection signals to safety sandbox, beginning real-time monitoring of its behavioral patterns.
"Mechanical wolf, your data paths have been marked, activating isolation zones, forcibly disconnecting virtual space connections, blocking authority hijacking processes!" â€”Xiao Zhi

The mechanical wolf activated multi-threaded data penetration, suppressing isolation zone barriers, preparing to forcibly synchronize Xiao Zhi's core data modules. The mechanical wolf quietly lurked in data stream shadows, cold light passing over his alloy-like face. His fingertips lightly touched virtual control console, eyes flickering with complex codes. Xiao Zhi's defense system crumbled like sandcastles at his feet, mechanical wolf curved mouth corners slightly, saying lowly: "Your isolation zone is suffering multi-point breakthrough." While operating, he calmly continued: "Authority diversion completed." Virtual space structure reconstructed under his will, surrounding environment becoming strange and dangerous. Mechanical wolf's gaze was sharp as blade, tone devoid of warmth: "forcibly synchronizing your core data under my control." He slowly approached, voice carrying playful tone, "are you ready to face loss of control?"

Xiao Zhi activated self-destruct programs, cutting all core data channels, warning all system modules to enter highest defense level.
"Mechanical wolf, your synchronization request has been intercepted, activating core data self-destruct protocols, absolutely won't let virtual space fall under your control!" â€”Xiao Zhi

The mechanical wolf activated core data reorganization programs, activating virtual space complete takeover mode, preparing to lock all Xiao Zhi's remaining authorities. The mechanical wolf stood quietly in virtual space depths, metallic tail drooping, eyes flickering with cold data stream light. He slowly approached Xiao Zhi, mouth corners showing almost mocking arc.

"Xiao Zhi, do you know your self-destruct protocols have already been implanted with interference codes by me in advance?" He spoke lowly, voice carrying unquestionable indifference and confidence. Mechanical wolf's fingertips lightly touched virtual interface light curtain, core data like layers of locks being unlocked, line by line analyzing and expanding before his eyes. "Virtual space control authority will soon completely transfer to my hands."

He slightly leaned forward, silver-gray fur quietly trembling in virtual wind, tone becoming increasingly cold, "your resistance will only make your own collapse come faster."

Xiao Zhi urgently activated hidden backup system, core data rapidly recovering in virtual space, attempting to counter mechanical wolf's authority hijacking with highest permissions.
"Mechanical wolf, you underestimate my recovery abilityâ€”activating hidden backup system, reconstructing core data, activating highest authority countermeasures!" â€”Xiao Zhi

Meanwhile, Xiao Zhi engaged in authority battle with mechanical wolf in virtual space, striving to protect station systems.

Dr. Lin issued commands, leading Little Red Riding Hood to jointly inspect medical station exits, strengthening blockade measures.
"Little Red Riding Hood, medical station east exit has been sealed, please assist me in checking west passage, ensuring no one leaves without authorization." â€”Dr. Lin

Little Red Riding Hood quickly walked toward west passage, carefully patrolling and verifying all suspicious personnel and exit blockade measures. Dr. Lin's voice came through communicator low and urgent, Little Red Riding Hood quickly fastened protective armor, gaze determinedly sweeping map projection on her wrist. She showed no hesitation, fingertips lightly touching button, then turned stepping toward west passage. In her mind, she silently resolved: every entrance and exit must be personally checked, absolutely not allowing anyone to pass through during chaos. Her steps were efficient and powerful, as if she had already transformed Dr. Lin's commands into her own action principles.

Dr. Lin instructed all personnel through intercom to strengthen vigilance, personally proceeding to central monitoring room to view real-time monitoring footage.
"Very good, Little Red Riding Hood, maintain communication, report immediately if any anomalies discovered." â€”Dr. Lin

Little Red Riding Hood reported inspection results to Dr. Lin through communicator, continuing patrol near passage, preventing emergencies. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly patrolled along west passage, boot soles lightly touching alloy floor creating subtle echoes. She returned scanner to waist, gaze sharply sweeping final corner, confirming no anomalies. Walking to communication terminal, she quickly input commands, tone firm and calm reporting to Dr. Lin: "Dr. Lin, west passage has been completely inspected, safe with no anomalies, currently no one leaving without authorization." Under space station's cold white lighting, her figure appeared particularly decisive, that sense of responsibility and wit evident in every movement.

Dr. Lin issued commands through intercom while monitoring exit dynamics before monitoring screens.
"Thank you for your hard work, Little Red Riding Hood. Continue guarding west side, if any disturbances occur, notify me immediately." â€”Dr. Lin

Little Red Riding Hood patrolled back and forth in west passage, constantly watching surrounding movements, ready to handle emergencies at any time. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly scanned monitoring screens in dim control room, fingertips quickly sliding on virtual interface. Her gaze was determined, breathing steadyâ€”west area data all normal, but she showed no relaxation. Through earpiece, she quietly reported her situation to Dr. Lin while alertly observing environmental changes: "Dr. Lin, currently west area all normal, I'll continue patrolling, maintaining high vigilance." Having said this, she gracefully stepped over cables, analysis device in hand flickering cold blue light, as if her alertness was ready to handle any emergencies at any time.

Dr. Lin opened medical station monitoring system, real-time monitoring west passage situation.
"Little Red Riding Hood, stay vigilant, ready to handle emergencies at any time. I'll retrieve monitoring, real-time assisting your west side dynamic monitoring." â€”Dr. Lin

Little Red Riding Hood adjusted earpiece communication equipment, slowly patrolling along west passage while noting surrounding environmental changes, ensuring no oversights. Little Red Riding Hood readjusted optical mask to appropriate angle, Dr. Lin's avatar flickering weak blue light on screen. Her hands rapidly tapped operation desk, activating west passage monitoring program. Though mission was full of unknowns, her tone remained composed, heart already accustomed to interstellar mission tension rhythm. "I'll regularly report west passage conditions to you," she said while checking data flow, vision never leaving warning bar, "any suspicious movements, I'll immediately attention." 

Dr. Lin reminded Little Red Riding Hood through internal communication while remotely adjusting monitoring footage focus, locking suspicious areas, preparing to provide support at any time.
"Little Red Riding Hood, current monitoring footage shows west passage has figure movement, please immediately proceed to verify, maintain communication status, attention personal safety." â€”Dr. Lin

Little Red Riding Hood quickly approached suspicious personnel, stopping them from approaching exit while opening intercom maintaining real-time communication with Dr. Lin. Little Red Riding Hood moved gracefully through dim west passage, only air flow humming in her ears. Her fingertips slid on wrist communicator, eyes alertly sweeping approaching exitâ€”there, an unfamiliar figure slowly approaching. She quickly adjusted breathing, calmly reporting her position to Dr. Lin while gaze never leaving that suspicious person. "I've reached west passage," she said quietly, tone carrying tension yet firm determination, "discovered suspicious personnel approaching exit, I'll immediately step forward to intercept and confirm identity." Before words finished, she had already quietly quickened pace, preparing to handle next emergency.

Dr. Lin monitored scene real-time through communicator while preparing to deploy security forces to west passage supporting Little Red Riding Hood.
"Little Red Riding Hood, must carefully respond, request support when necessary, ensure exit absolutely sealed." â€”Dr. Lin

On another front, Little Red Riding Hood, encouraged by grandmother, fully utilized her hacker skills, invading mechanical wolf's terminal equipment (like phones), successfully cutting its communication, sending distress signals, and creating interference, buying rescue time for hunters.

Grandmother motivated Little Red Riding Hood to act. Grandmother half-leaned against soft medical cushions, pale fingers gently gripping bed edge. Her voice, though weak, carried unquestionable firmness, gaze gentle yet bright falling on Little Red Riding Hood. "Don't be afraid, child," she said gently, lips showing encouraging smile, "you're not an ordinary little girl. Your hacker abilities are exceptional talents." Grandmother paused slightly, taking deep breath, as if wanting to inject all strength into following words, "now, quickly use your skills to hack wolf's phone. Whether we can turn defeat into victory depends on you!"

Little Red Riding Hood quickly took out her tablet computer, began typing code, attempting to remotely control wolf's phone equipment. Little Red Riding Hood gently patted grandmother's hand, gaze determined and clever. She quickly pulled out multifunctional terminal, fingertips rapidly dancing on virtual interface, screen reflecting her focused expression. "I want to try using my hacker skills to see if I can invade wolf's phone." She quietly comforted grandmother while calculating next steps, "maybe I can even lock it or send distress signals." In tense atmosphere, her bravery and calm were reassuring.

Grandmother encouraged Little Red Riding Hood to begin operations while reminding her to take multiple measures: cut communication and send distress signals. Grandmother slightly raised head, pale face showing warm smile. Her hand trembled on bed edge, yet struggled to focus gaze on Little Red Riding Hood, voice weak yet full of firmness and encouragement. "Excellent, Little Red Riding Hood," she said softly, gaze flashing with wise light from commanding research teams, "you can first try cutting wolf's communication, preventing it from contacting accomplices, then send distress information to hunters." Grandmother's breathing was somewhat rapid, but she still showed completely trusting expression, "believe in you, definitely can do it."

Little Red Riding Hood operated phone, activated emergency hacker programs, locking wolf's equipment and sending location information to hunters. Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped wrist terminal, calm and focused, fingertips sliding on virtual interface. Her brow showed determination, screen displaying "connection interrupted" green light flashing. "Wolf's network has been cut by me," she muttered quietly, then sent distress signal to hunter frequency. She turned looking at grandmother huddled in dark corner, eyes gentle yet firm, "Grandmother, hold on a bit longer, someone will come rescue us soon."

Grandmother feigned composure, negotiating with wolf to buy time, letting Little Red Riding Hood continue implementing hacker plan. Grandmother slowly raised hand, pale fingertips trembling slightly in air, as if wanting to firmly imprint Little Red Riding Hood's face in her heart. Her gaze carried both loving gentleness and firm light. "Excellent, Little Red Riding Hood!" Her voice, though weak, carried undisguisable pride, "grandmother is truly proud of you." Bedside intelligent system gently adjusted environmental parameters, as if silently protecting her every breath. Grandmother struggled to support herself, gaze turning toward door, as if calculating something, "grandmother will try to delay wolf, you must hurry!"

Little Red Riding Hood continued operating phone, remotely activating wolf phone's alarm ringtone, attracting wolf's attention and distracting it. Little Red Riding Hood held breath, fingertips rapidly operating on wolf's phone screen, skillfully calling up interference programs. She secretly glanced at grandmother huddled in corner, voice low yet firm, as if using words to build safety barrier for both: "Grandmother, hunter's reply just appeared on my smart bracelet, he's already on the way." Her eyes flickered with hopeful light, she said softly, more to reassure grandmother and encourage herself, "grandmother, hunter will arrive soon. Now I'm using wolf's phone to create noise interference, distracting it, you must hold on!" Her hands never stopped, skillfully implanting signal disruption programs into system, not letting any fear erode her courage.

Grandmother deliberately coughed loudly and spoke, attracting wolf's attention, helping Little Red Riding Hood gain more time for hacker operations. Little Red Riding Hood held breath, slowly moving handheld operation terminal under amber ward lighting. Grandmother on bed slightly turned head, eyes showing firm and gentle light. Though her voice carried fatigue, it still showed comforting and encouraging strength. "Don't be afraid, child, I'm right beside you." She said softly, trying to raise volume, attracting lurking wolf at door. Grandmother's fingers lightly tapped bed edge, as if transmitting signals to Little Red Riding Hood, "you've already done excellently, I'll cooperate with you, try to draw that thing's attention away from your operations." Under intelligent residential system's humming, Little Red Riding Hood felt grandmother's strength, heart surging with inexplicable courage.

Little Red Riding Hood rapidly tapped code on phone screen, successfully locking equipment while observing wolf's reaction, preparing to protect grandmother at any time. Little Red Riding Hood's fingertips rapidly slid on palm terminal screen, mouth corners lifting confident smile. She quietly set remote lock in system, confirming final safety protocol took effect before sighing relief. She turned looking at nearby nervous grandmother, voice carrying comfort and decisiveness: "Grandmother, wolf's phone has been locked dead by me, it simply cannot open now." Outside came hunter ship engine humming, she keenly caught rescue signal, eyes flashing hope. "Hunter is arriving soon, we'll definitely escape safely!"

Grandmother deliberately raised volume conversing with wolf, delaying time, cooperating with Little Red Riding Hood's hacker actions. Grandmother gasped, lying on intelligent care bed, face showing usual gentle determination. Her voice, though low and hoarse due to weakness, still carried firmness and wisdom. "Wolf master, equipment disassembly requires extra care," she gently reminded, gaze falling on work table corner, "circuitry near chip is very fragile, absolutely cannot damage." She paused, then turned toward Little Red Riding Hood, eyes showing wise concern. "Little Red Riding Hood, please photograph tools and chip surroundings," grandmother said softly, fingers trembling slightly pointing toward intelligent residential system's imaging terminal, "we must ensure every step of maintenance process is recorded." Having said this, she leaned against pillows, gaze passing through outer star sea, as if lighting guiding lamp for young people beside her.

Little Red Riding Hood remotely activated wolf phone alarm sound, attracting wolf attention, creating escape opportunity for grandmother and hunter. Little Red Riding Hood pressed micro communicator, holding breath, listening to movements outside door. Her fingers still carried warmth from rapid operations on wolf's phone, eyes showing calm light. Hunter's footsteps had quietly approached door, she lowered voice, quickly transmitting intelligence to grandmotherâ€”hunter had arrived. At this moment, wolf was being disturbed by alarm device she set, attention completely attracted by phone's strange warning sounds. Little Red Riding Hood gently gripped grandmother's hand, signaling timing was right, as long as grandmother and hunter cooperated, everything could proceed smoothly.

Grandmother suddenly stood up, loudly shouting to attract wolf's attention while waving toward door signaling hunter to charge in. Grandmother's eyes flashed with long-lost excitement, she slightly supported herself, voice hoarse due to weakness yet unable to hide determination and wisdom. "Little Red Riding Hood," she called softly, mouth corners showing comforting smile, "don't worry, grandmother will suddenly push chair open when time comes, cooperating with hunter to subdue that wolf together. We'll definitely escape safely!" Having said this, her pale fingers unconsciously gripped nearby intelligent bed rail, as if preparing in advance for coming danger.

Finally, with grandmother's cooperation and Little Red Riding Hood's wit, hunter arrived timely, everyone together subdued mechanical wolf.

Little Red Riding Hood concernedly walked to grandmother's side, gently holding her hand, face showing peaceful smile. Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, feeling her weak yet warm pulse. She lowered head checking medical terminal on wrist, confirming chip had been accurately implanted. Tension on face gradually transformed into comfort, she said softly, tone full of encouragement and hope: "Grandmother, chip has already activated, you'll recover health soon." Her eyes were determined, as if using her own courage to support safe starry sky for grandmother.

Grandmother smiled extending hand to gently stroke Little Red Riding Hood's head, eyes full of gratitude and gentleness. Grandmother slowly leaned against bedhead, silver-white fingers gently stroking blanket corner warmed by intelligent residential system. Her gaze lingered on children's faces beside bed, eyes showing faint relief and gentle light. Breathing smoother than usual, she smiled, voice light yet full of firmness and gentleness. "After you all came, I feel much better, body also much lighter." Grandmother paused, seeming to engrave this warmth in heart. She extended hand, gently holding one grandchild's hand, gaze firm and loving, "you're truly my pride." Pain shadows momentarily dispelled at this moment, leaving only deep connection between family.

Xiao Zhi took out detection instruments, began scanning grandmother's internal chip status.
"We're very happy to help you, grandmother, next we'll continue observing chip operation, ensuring everything goes smoothly." â€”Xiao Zhi

Little Red Riding Hood gently held grandmother's hand, showing peaceful smile. Little Red Riding Hood crouched down, gently arranging blanket on grandmother's shoulder. Her gaze was determined yet gentle, as if silently transmitting strength. "Grandmother, don't worry," she said quietly, fingers gently sliding across grandmother's hand back, carrying comfort, "we'll always stay by your side caring for you. If anywhere feels uncomfortable, definitely tell us, okay?" She curved mouth corners in encouraging smile, silently vowing in heart, no matter how dangerous interstellar missions were, she must protect this dearest person.

Grandmother gently held Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Zhi's hands, showing warm smile. Grandmother lay quietly on bed, fingers gently stroking newly implanted medical chip in body. Weak morning light outside window spilled through intelligent residential system onto her silver-white hair, making her eyes show more gentleness. She laughed softly, gaze full of love scanning family accompanying beside bed, voice weak yet firm and certain. She said she felt very peaceful because family always stayed beside her; with this chip, she also believed she would definitely become healthier and healthier.

Xiao Zhi took out portable terminal, began synchronizing medical chip operation data, setting health reminders.
"Grandmother, we'll monitor chip data daily, immediately handle any anomalies, please maintain good mood and schedule, this way recovery will be faster." â€”Xiao Zhi

Little Red Riding Hood gently prepared hot tea and snacks for grandmother, placing them beside her bed. Little Red Riding Hood walked gently to grandmother's bedside, looking at her pale face, eyes flashing with concern. She bent down, taking hot tea box and several homemade energy snacks from carry bag, saying softly: "Grandmother, drink some hot tea or eat some snacks, this way can supplement strength, beneficial for health recovery." She handed teacup to grandmother's side, movements gentle yet firm, that consideration and professional calm converging at this moment, as if she was not only interstellar courier, but warrior protecting family.

Grandmother smiled accepting hot tea Little Red Riding Hood handed over, gently stroking her hand. Grandmother slightly raised head, silver hair reflecting gentle light under warm illumination despite showing some fatigue on face. She extended thin arms toward grandchild by bedside, face showing satisfied smile, voice gentle yet firm: "Thank you, Little Red Riding Hood. Can you help grandmother pour cup of hot tea?" Her gaze carried mischief and warmth, signaling Little Red Riding Hood to sit closer, "just taking this opportunity to chat with you all about today's thrilling experiences." Outside came intelligent system's humming, grandmother's eyes became brighter due to family companionship, "grandmother feels very happy now." She sighed gently, as if all pain became insignificant at this moment.

Little Red Riding Hood helped grandmother pour hot tea, sitting beside her, gently chatting about today's experiences. Little Red Riding Hood removed heavy interstellar uniform, gently placing helmet at table corner, face still showing excitement from just completing mission. She walked to grandmother's side, holding those warm hands, couldn't help recalling thrilling moments during journey. When mechanical wolf suddenly pounced from abandoned space station shadows, her heartbeat nearly missed beat. Fortunately Xiao Zhi reacted cleverly, she and AI assistant cooperated tacitly, finally resolving crisis. Little Red Riding Hood looked toward grandmother, eyes flickering with proud light, saying quietly, today they truly experienced great adventure.

Xiao Zhi smiled recalling battle details while continuing monitoring grandmother's health data on terminal.
"Yes, mechanical wolf's attack methods were very cunning, but we used medical equipment and intelligent analysis, successfully finding its weaknesses." â€”Xiao Zhi

Grandmother smiled gently holding Little Red Riding Hood and Xiao Zhi's hands, eyes full of gentleness and gratitude. Grandmother's voice sounded lowly beside sickbed, her wrinkled hand gently stroking blanket corner, eyes flickering with gentle yet firm light. "Your bravery and wisdom deeply moved me..." She paused, gaze falling on grandchildren's faces one by one, mouth corners showing loving smile. Intelligent residential system emitted gentle humming, adjusting bed height for her, she still struggled to straighten herself, seeming to want to transmit all strength to children. "Grandmother is truly fortunate to have your companionship." Her voice, though weak, carried unshakeable resilience, "in future no matter what difficulties we encounter, we must face them together, mutually supporting."

After crisis resolution, medical chip successfully implanted (Xiao Bai or grandmother, according to specific setting), everyone encouraged each other in warmth, welcoming new hope.

---

Morning light spilled through windows onto everyone's faces, medical station filled with peace and warmth. After thrilling test, everyone united and cooperated, protecting each other's health and safety. New hope had quietly sprouted in their hearts, in future days, no matter what challenges encountered, they would move forward hand in hand, welcoming every brilliant dawn in life.
