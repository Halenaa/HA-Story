Driven by his vow to end the people's suffering, he kneels, presses his hand to the cracked earth, and feels the heat radiate through his skin. As he prepares his arrows, a shimmering portal opens amid swirling golden dust, and the Heavenly Envoy descends, robes fluttering in the searing wind. The Envoy raises a scroll and proclaims in a clipped, formal tone that the Jade Emperor forbids interference with celestial order. Hou Yi clenches his fist, then stands and meets the Envoy's gaze, declaring he will act regardless of the consequences. The Envoy, bound by duty, returns through the portal, leaving Hou Yi to notch his first arrow and take aim at the burning sky. His determination is clear: he will protect humanity, even if it means defying the heavens.",

She gestures with a slender, jeweled hand, presenting a porcelain vial filled with a shimmering elixir. Hou Yi bows deeply, his gaze fixed on the elixir, then extends his hands to accept it, fingers trembling with anticipation. The Queen Mother’s voice rings clear as she warns him, 'This elixir grants immortality—use it with wisdom, for it may divide as well as preserve.' Hou Yi nods solemnly, clutching the vial to his chest. A sudden breeze stirs his cloak, and the faint, sweet aroma of the elixir drifts upward. Determined to protect Chang'e, Hou Yi thanks the Queen Mother, then turns and strides from the pavilion, the vial concealed in his grasp and his purpose set.",

Feng Meng approaches, footsteps muffled by wet moss, carrying a battered practice bow. Without invitation, Feng Meng sets the bow down with a sharp thud beside Hou Yi and demands to know the whereabouts of the Queen Mother’s elixir, his tone edged with barely concealed resentment. Hou Yi rises, careful not to let his guard down, and replies that such matters are not for mortals to covet, his voice steady but wary. As Hou Yi turns to secure the quiver inside the armory, Feng Meng glances around, eyes narrowing on the half-open door to Hou Yi’s private chamber. Driven by ambition, he slips inside, rifling through shelves and knocking aside scrolls in his search for the elixir. Hou Yi, hearing the disturbance, rushes back and seizes Feng Meng’s arm, demanding an explanation. The confrontation escalates as Feng Meng shoves Hou Yi aside and bolts from the room, leaving behind scattered scrolls and a faint trail of mud across the polished floor. The objective is Feng Meng’s attempt to seize the elixir; the outcome is his betrayal now revealed to Hou Yi, who stands amid the disarray, realizing the extent of his apprentice’s envy.",

Chang'e notices and quickly slides the box behind her, voice steady as she asks his purpose. Feng Meng steps closer, demanding the elixir for himself, his words clipped and urgent. When Chang'e refuses and steps back, he lunges, knocking over a teacup, hot liquid splashing onto the floor. Chang'e, realizing the danger, snatches the elixir and, with trembling hands, drinks it in one swift motion. Instantly, a cold wind whirls through the cottage, extinguishing the lantern and sending loose leaves skittering across the floor. Feng Meng recoils, shielding his eyes from the sudden burst of silvery light that envelops Chang'e, who begins to rise from the earth, her form growing lighter as the cottage fills with the scent of jasmine and ozone.",

He opens a hidden alcove in the wall, revealing a set of shimmering keys, and nudges them toward Chang'e. 'Only those who complete the moon's tasks may hold these,' he says.

Hou Yi lifts his head, voice steady as he pleads, 'For the sake of mortals, I beg the Heavens for mercy—restore my wife to me.' The Envoy narrows his eyes, rolls the scroll closed, and commands Hou Yi to rise, stating that only the Jade Emperor may grant such a request. Hou Yi stands, bows low, and presents his bow as a token of humility, declaring his willingness to accept any trial. The Envoy gestures grandly towards the palace, signaling that Hou Yi may enter and make his case before the Jade Emperor. The gates swing open with a resonant groan, their surfaces cold and slick beneath Hou Yi's hands as he steps inside, the scent of jasmine and sandalwood thickening in the air. The Envoy follows, ensuring protocol is maintained, driven by his duty to enforce the Emperor's will.",

Without hesitation, Chang’e kneels and presents the moonflower she has cultivated in exile, offering it as proof of her growth and intent to restore balance. From the mist, two Moon Guardians emerge, their silver armor reflecting the lunar glow. One Guardian steps forward, extending a staff that hums with celestial energy, and demands Chang’e answer three riddles before the gate will open. Jade Rabbit circles Chang’e, sniffing the moonflower and watching her reactions. Chang’e, motivated by her longing to regain agency over her fate and return to Hou Yi, listens, considers, and answers each riddle with careful logic and humility. Satisfied, the Guardians raise their staffs, parting the palace gates with a resonant clang. Chang’e, guided by Jade Rabbit’s nod, steps forward into the inner sanctum, having earned the right to seek an audience with the Queen Mother of the West. The crisp scent of ice and the faint trace of jasmine linger as the doors close behind her.",
