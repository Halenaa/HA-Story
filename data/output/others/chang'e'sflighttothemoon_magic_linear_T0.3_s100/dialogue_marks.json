Driven by his vow to end the people's suffering, he kneels, presses his hand to the cracked earth, and feels the heat radiate through his skin. As he prepares his arrows, a shimmering portal opens amid swirling golden dust, and the Heavenly Envoy descends, robes fluttering in the searing wind. The Envoy raises a scroll and proclaims in a clipped, formal tone that the Jade Emperor forbids interference with celestial order. Hou Yi clenches his fist, then stands and meets the Envoy's gaze, declaring he will act regardless of the consequences. The Envoy, bound by duty, returns through the portal, leaving Hou Yi to notch his first arrow and take aim at the burning sky. His determination is clear: he will protect humanity, even if it means defying the heavens.",
