Driven by his vow to end the people's suffering, he kneels, presses his hand to the cracked earth, and feels the heat radiate through his skin. As he prepares his arrows, a shimmering portal opens amid swirling golden dust, and the Heavenly Envoy descends, robes fluttering in the searing wind. The Envoy raises a scroll and proclaims in a clipped, formal tone that the Jade Emperor forbids interference with celestial order. Hou Yi clenches his fist, then stands and meets the Envoy's gaze, declaring he will act regardless of the consequences. The Envoy, bound by duty, returns through the portal, leaving Hou Yi to notch his first arrow and take aim at the burning sky. His determination is clear: he will protect humanity, even if it means defying the heavens.",

Hou Yi nods solemnly, clutching the vial to his chest. A sudden breeze stirs his cloak, and the faint, sweet aroma of the elixir drifts upward.

Hou Yi rises, careful not to let his guard down, and replies that such matters are not for mortals to covet, his voice steady but wary. As Hou Yi turns to secure the quiver inside the armory, Feng Meng glances around, eyes narrowing on the half-open door to Hou Yi’s private chamber. Driven by ambition, he slips inside, rifling through shelves and knocking aside scrolls in his search for the elixir. Hou Yi, hearing the disturbance, rushes back and seizes Feng Meng’s arm, demanding an explanation. The confrontation escalates as Feng Meng shoves Hou Yi aside and bolts from the room, leaving behind scattered scrolls and a faint trail of mud across the polished floor.

She pauses, feeling the cold grit beneath her bare feet, and raises her hand to knock on the crystalline doors. The Jade Rabbit, alert and twitching his nose, leaps from a nearby boulder and blocks her path, his ears flicking in warning as he says, 'Only those who uphold the moon’s order may pass, Lady Chang’e.' Without hesitation, Chang’e kneels and presents the moonflower she has cultivated in exile, offering it as proof of her growth and intent to restore balance. From the mist, two Moon Guardians emerge, their silver armor reflecting the lunar glow. One Guardian steps forward, extending a staff that hums with celestial energy, and demands Chang’e answer three riddles before the gate will open. Jade Rabbit circles Chang’e, sniffing the moonflower and watching her reactions. Chang’e, motivated by her longing to regain agency over her fate and return to Hou Yi, listens, considers, and answers each riddle with careful logic and humility. Satisfied, the Guardians raise their staffs, parting the palace gates with a resonant clang. Chang’e, guided by Jade Rabbit’s nod, steps forward into the inner sanctum, having earned the right to seek an audience with the Queen Mother of the West. The crisp scent of ice and the faint trace of jasmine linger as the doors close behind her.",

The Jade Rabbit circles the pair, sniffing Hou Yi's cloak and muttering moon riddles, testing his resolve.

The marble arch shimmers, allowing Hou Yi and Chang'e to embrace briefly before the Guardians demand a choice: only one may return to earth.

Feng Meng is not just ambitious and sneaky; he is openly resentful and attempts to justify his actions as justice rather than simple envy. The dialogue also introduces themes of honor, justice, and personal worth, and references Chang’e as a potential target. The updated plot incorporates these elements to maintain consistency with the deeper motivations and arguments expressed in the dialogue.",

The argument is more drawn out, with increased emotional tension, fear, and pleas from Chang'e before the final act.

The original plot has Hou Yi addressing only the Envoy and entering the palace before making his case.

Their motivations and emotional states are explored more fully, and they discuss the possibility of sharing the burden or defying the Guardians, rather than immediately making a choice. The plot is updated to reflect these expanded negotiations and emotional exchanges, deepening Chang'e's agency and both characters' commitment to each other. No major deviation from character logic or motivation is present; the update primarily integrates these richer interactions into the plot.",
