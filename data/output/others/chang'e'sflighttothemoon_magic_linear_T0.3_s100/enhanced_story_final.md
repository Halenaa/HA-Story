# Chapter 1: Hou Yi Slays the Ten Suns

Hou Yi strides into the village square, bow slung across his back, sweat streaming down his brow as he surveys the devastation.

Driven by his vow to end the people's suffering, he kneels, presses his hand to the cracked earth, and feels the heat radiate through his skin.

As he prepares his arrows, a shimmering portal opens amid swirling golden dust, and the Heavenly Envoy descends, robes fluttering in the searing wind.

The Envoy raises a scroll and proclaims in a clipped, formal tone that the Jade Emperor forbids interference with celestial order.

Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy unfurls a golden-edged scroll, holding it aloft for all to witness, his expression resolute and his posture unwavering. With measured grace, the Heavenly Envoy unfurled the golden-edged scroll, its surface gleaming beneath the celestial light. He held it high, allowing every eye in the assembly to witness the Jade Emperor’s command. His expression remained resolute, posture unwavering, as he intoned in a clipped, formal tone that brooked no opposition. By decree of the Jade Emperor, he announced, no mortal nor spirit would henceforth meddle with the order of Heaven. The balance of the celestial realm, he declared, was sacrosanct—any interference, forbidden from this moment onward.
Hou Yi clenches his fist, then stands and meets the Envoy's gaze, declaring he will act regardless of the consequences.

Hou Yi rises from his seat, his hand clenched tight, meeting the Envoy’s gaze with unwavering resolve. Hou Yi rose from his seat, his hand clenched tight—a silent testament to the storm gathering within him. He met the Envoy’s gaze, eyes burning with a resolve that would not be shaken. “You speak of consequences as if they might sway me,” he said, his voice steady but edged with heat. The suffering of mortals weighed on him more heavily than any threat from the heavens; he would not stand idle while their pain deepened. If his choices drew the wrath of gods, then so be it—he was prepared to bear that burden, for honor demanded no less.
Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy steps forward, eyes narrowed, the weight of celestial judgment heavy in their voice. The Heavenly Envoy stepped forward, eyes narrowed, every movement measured beneath the weight of celestial judgment. Their voice, cool and unwavering, pressed into the tense air between them. “Heaven has cast down greater souls for less, Hou Yi,” the Envoy intoned, their gaze never wavering from his. “Are you prepared to lose everything you cherish for this defiance?”
Hou Yi steps forward, his gaze unwavering as he squares his shoulders, meeting the Envoy's eyes without flinching. Hou Yi clenched his fist, feeling the weight of the villagers’ silent hopes pressing against his chest. Without hesitation, he rose and stepped forward, squaring his shoulders as he met the Envoy’s gaze head-on. The flicker of uncertainty in the Envoy’s eyes did not escape him. Hou Yi’s voice rang out, steady and resolute, “If the price of mercy is all I hold dear, then let heaven strip me bare—for I will not betray those who look to me for hope.” The words hung in the air, defiant and unwavering, echoing his determination to face divine judgment rather than abandon those who depended on him.
The Envoy, bound by duty, returns through the portal, leaving Hou Yi to notch his first arrow and take aim at the burning sky.

His determination is clear: he will protect humanity, even if it means defying the heavens.

----------------------------------------

As the smoke from the fallen suns drifts across the scorched earth, word of Hou Yi’s defiance quickly spreads beyond the mortal realm. The heavens, unsettled by his boldness, begin to stir with whispers of consequence and recompense. In the midst of uncertainty, a new figure emerges from the celestial tapestry—one whose power rivals even the Jade Emperor’s decree. As Hou Yi contemplates the fate he has sealed for himself, the Queen Mother of the West descends from her ethereal palace, bearing an offer that could alter the course of his destiny.

# Chapter 2: The Queen Mother Offers the Elixir

Hou Yi ascends the wide marble steps, his boots scraping against the cool stone as he approaches the Queen Mother of the West, who stands regally beside a low jade table.

She gestures with a slender, jeweled hand, presenting a porcelain vial filled with a shimmering elixir.

Hou Yi bows deeply, his gaze fixed on the elixir, then extends his hands to accept it, fingers trembling with anticipation.

The Queen Mother’s voice rings clear as she warns him, 'This elixir grants immortality—use it with wisdom, for it may divide as well as preserve.

Queen Mother of the WestThe Queen Mother of the West stands tall, her gaze unwavering and regal, as she raises the vial, the shimmering liquid within casting ethereal reflections. Her words hang in the air, commanding respect and contemplation. The Queen Mother of the West stood tall, her poise unyielding as she lifted the delicate vial, its contents swirling with a light that seemed to bend the very air. Her gaze, ancient and inscrutable, settled upon him; the silence that followed was as heavy as the mountains she ruled. “This elixir I bestow is no mere gift,” she intoned, her voice carrying a chill clarity that left no room for doubt. “Its essence will shield you from the grasp of death, yet its power is double-edged.” The shimmering liquid caught the light, casting fleeting ripples across her austere features as she studied him, weighing his soul in that moment. “Immortality can be a blessing,” she continued, her tone both regal and somber, “but it may also set you apart from those you hold dear, forging distances no mortal bridge can span.” Her words lingered in the air, commanding him to consider the gravity of her offer. “Consider this truth deeply before you accept its embrace.”
' Hou Yi nods solemnly, clutching the vial to his chest.

A sudden breeze stirs his cloak, and the faint, sweet aroma of the elixir drifts upward.

Determined to protect Chang'e, Hou Yi thanks the Queen Mother, then turns and strides from the pavilion, the vial concealed in his grasp and his purpose set.

Hou Yi bows respectfully to the Queen Mother, his eyes shining with determination. He tightens his grip on the concealed vial, then straightens, ready to depart the pavilion. Hou Yi bowed low before the Queen Mother, his every movement marked by the reverence due to the celestial sovereign. As he rose, determination flickered in his eyes, the weight of purpose settling over him. Fingers closing tightly around the hidden vial—a gift more precious than gold—he offered his thanks, voice steady with resolve. He promised, no matter the cost, that Chang’e’s safety would be assured. With one last respectful nod, Hou Yi straightened, the resolve in his bearing unmistakable, and turned from the pavilion, striding into the uncertainty that awaited beyond.
Queen Mother of the WestThe Queen Mother inclines her head, her gaze lingering on Hou Yi as he turns to depart, her words echoing behind him like a subtle warning. The Queen Mother inclined her head, her regal bearing undiminished as her enigmatic gaze lingered on Hou Yi’s retreating figure. As he turned to depart, her voice—calm yet carrying the weight of cosmic judgment—trailed behind him, a subtle warning woven into its resonance. “May your heart remain steadfast, Hou Yi,” she intoned, the syllables threading through the perfumed air of the pavilion. “For the vial’s power is as perilous as it is precious.” The words hung between them, both benediction and admonition, as Hou Yi strode away, the fate of mortals and immortals alike balanced upon his choices.
----------------------------------------

As Hou Yi and Chang'e leave the celestial palace, the lingering weight of the Queen Mother's warning settles between them, casting a shadow over their journey home. Unbeknownst to them, envy and ambition stir in the heart of Hou Yi's trusted disciple, Feng Meng, whose gaze has already turned covetous. While Hou Yi seeks only to protect what he cherishes most, danger quietly begins to take root among those closest to him, threatening to unravel the fragile peace the couple hopes to preserve.

# Chapter 3: Feng Meng’s Betrayal

Hou Yi kneels near a wooden rack, methodically polishing a quiver of arrows while watching the horizon, his muscles tense.

Feng Meng approaches, carrying a battered practice bow, and immediately confronts Hou Yi about the Queen Mother’s elixir, his voice laced with resentment and frustration at being kept in the dark.

Their exchange is heated and philosophical, with Feng Meng openly challenging Hou Yi’s authority and motivations, arguing that mortals deserve to decide their own fate.

Feng Meng slams the bow down beside Hou Yi, standing over him with narrowed eyes and clenched fists, his voice tight with anger and wounded pride. Without warning, Feng Meng strode forward and slammed the bow down beside Hou Yi, the wood striking the floor with a sharp, accusatory thud. He loomed over his former master, fists clenched so tightly his knuckles whitened. His eyes narrowed, burning with a mix of anger and wounded pride that twisted his features.  

“Enough with your riddles, Hou Yi,” he said, voice taut with resentment. “Where is the Queen Mother’s elixir?” The words came out almost as a hiss, edged with jealousy. “Don’t pretend you don’t know—the whole palace whispers your name.” His gaze lingered, searching Hou Yi’s face for any flicker of guilt or fear. “Did you really think you could keep it hidden from me?”  

The tension between them crackled, Feng Meng’s ambition and envy finally erupting into accusation, his betrayal laid bare in the confrontation.
Hou Yi straightens, eyes narrowing as he places a protective hand over his satchel, bracing for Feng Meng’s next move. Hou Yi straightened, a protective hand instinctively settling over his satchel as his eyes narrowed, bracing for whatever challenge Feng Meng would hurl next. Feng Meng had set the bow down beside him with a sharp, deliberate thud, the sound echoing between them—a warning, a provocation. Hou Yi met Feng Meng’s glare, his voice steady but edged with compassion and caution. “Feng Meng, your anger blinds you,” he said, the words cutting through the tension. “What would you do with a power so dangerous?”
Feng Meng steps closer, fists clenched, eyes burning with accusation. Feng Meng stepped forward, his fists clenched tight at his sides and eyes burning with accusation. Without waiting for permission, he set the bow down beside Hou Yi with a sharp, deliberate thud—a challenge in itself. His voice was taut with resentment as he fixed his gaze on his master. “Spare me your warnings, Hou Yi,” he demanded, jealousy twisting each word. “I deserve what you hoard—so tell me, or must I tear this truth from you?”
Hou Yi stands, meeting Feng Meng’s glare, his hand hovering defensively near the bow. Hou Yi rose to his full height, unwavering beneath Feng Meng’s simmering gaze. His hand hovered instinctively near his bow, every muscle taut with the readiness born of countless battles. When Feng Meng slammed the bow down beside him, the sharp thud echoed through the silent room like a challenge. Hou Yi met Feng Meng’s demand head-on, his voice firm but edged with the frustration of a man misunderstood. “You mistake secrecy for greed,” he replied, his words cutting through the tension. “I have sworn to protect the elixir, not to claim it.” The oath weighed heavy on his heart, and in that moment, Hou Yi’s honor blazed brighter than any suspicion cast upon him.
Feng Meng steps closer, voice rising, eyes locked with Hou Yi’s in open challenge. Feng Meng stepped forward, the sharp thud of the bow on the stone floor echoing through the tense chamber. His voice, edged with resentment and rising above the hush, cut through the air as he locked eyes with Hou Yi—no trace of deference remaining. “Protect, or imprison?” he demanded, his lips curling with scorn. “You think yourself a guardian, but I see only a coward clutching what he fears to use.” The challenge lay naked in his gaze, ambition and jealousy simmering just beneath the surface as he awaited Hou Yi’s reply.
Hou Yi stands firm, his gaze unwavering as he subtly shifts between Feng Meng and the bow, ready for whatever confrontation may come. Hou Yi did not flinch, his posture resolute as Feng Meng slammed the bow down, its echo reverberating between them. Hou Yi’s eyes met Feng Meng’s with unwavering determination, darting briefly to the weapon as if weighing the cost of every possible move. The air around them grew taut with expectation, but Hou Yi remained steadfast, refusing to let pride or provocation sway him. If courage meant surrendering to reckless ambition, then so be it—let them call him coward. He would not, he resolved silently, betray the trust the gods had placed in him.
Feng Meng steps closer, his eyes narrowed and fists clenched, the tension between them thickening. Feng Meng stepped closer, the floorboards creaking under the force of his tightly coiled muscles. His eyes, narrowed with resentment, flicked to the bow as he set it down beside Hou Yi—a sharp, deliberate thud that cut through the heavy silence. The tension between them thickened, almost tangible. Voice low and edged with threat, Feng Meng hissed that Hou Yi had left him no choice; either the hiding place would be revealed willingly, or Feng Meng would find it himself, regardless of the cost.
Hou Yi, steadfast and honorable, rebuffs Feng Meng’s accusations and warns of the dangers of unchecked ambition.

Hou Yi straightens his posture, his eyes narrowed as he fixes his gaze on Feng Meng, every muscle ready for any sign of threat. Hou Yi drew himself up, shoulders squared, every muscle taut with vigilance. His gaze locked onto Feng Meng—a gaze sharpened by the weight of countless battles and divine expectation. "Feng Meng," he warned, voice low and unwavering, "there are realms and powers not meant for mortal hands, nor hearts." The words hung in the air, firm as the bow he often carried. Hou Yi’s compassion warred with his sense of honor, but determination steeled his tone. "To covet such things invites only ruin." He did not flinch, nor did he let his guard down, the threat of chaos pressing upon them both as the heavens seemed to listen.
Feng Meng steps forward, eyes narrowing with curiosity and a hint of defiance, watching Hou Yi's guarded posture. Feng Meng stepped forward, his eyes narrowing, curiosity flickering beneath the surface of his defiant stare. He watched Hou Yi’s every movement, noting the archer’s careful posture—a wariness that only stoked the resentment simmering inside him. “But Hou Yi,” he said, voice smooth yet edged with challenge, “who decides what mortals may reach for, if not mortals themselves?” The question hung in the air, as if daring Hou Yi to dismiss it, and Feng Meng’s ambition pulsed in the silence that followed, his gaze never wavering from his former master.
Hou Yi narrows his eyes, his hand instinctively resting near his bow as he watches Feng Meng's reaction. Hou Yi narrowed his eyes, the weight of centuries of judgment settling on his brow as his hand instinctively hovered near his bow. Rising to his feet, he kept his posture measured—never careless, never unguarded—every muscle ready should Feng Meng's intent shift. "It is wisdom, not mere desire, that draws such boundaries," he replied, his voice steady but edged with the conviction born of countless trials. His gaze lingered on Feng Meng, searching for any flicker of understanding. "Have you considered the cost of crossing them?" The words hung in the air, more challenge than warning, as if Hou Yi hoped compassion might temper recklessness before fate demanded its price.
Feng Meng steps closer, eyes fixed on Hou Yi, his tone both probing and edged with challenge. Feng Meng stepped closer, the glint of envy sharpened in his gaze as he fixed his attention on Hou Yi. His voice, probing and edged with challenge, slipped into the tense air between them. "Wisdom can be a shackle as much as a shield," he remarked, the words thick with accusation and longing. "Are you so certain that restraint is worth the dreams we must abandon?" The bitterness in his tone lingered, a subtle threat threaded through his ambition as he watched Hou Yi rise, every movement careful, the unspoken tension mounting between former master and apprentice.
Hou Yi's eyes narrow as he studies Feng Meng, his hand unconsciously drifting closer to the bow at his side. Hou Yi’s eyes narrowed, his gaze fixed intently on Feng Meng as tension crackled in the air between them. Almost without realizing it, his fingers drifted closer to the curve of the bow at his side—a silent promise of readiness. Rising with deliberate care, Hou Yi kept his posture guarded, refusing to betray any hint of vulnerability. His voice, steady and edged with the weight of experience, cut through the charged silence. “Dreams unchecked by caution become obsessions that consume all in their path, Feng Meng,” he warned, his words shaped by memories of devastation he’d witnessed before. “I have seen what such hunger leaves behind.” The echo of loss flickered in his eyes, but his stance remained resolute, a shield against both mortal folly and divine scrutiny.
Feng Meng's eyes narrow, a subtle challenge flickering in his gaze as he steps closer, searching Hou Yi's face for a crack in his resolve. Feng Meng’s eyes narrowed, a subtle challenge flickering in his gaze as he stepped closer, close enough to see the strain in Hou Yi’s jaw. He searched Hou Yi’s face, hungry for any crack in his legendary resolve. “Then perhaps it is not hunger, but fear, that truly binds you,” he murmured, voice low and edged with something sharper than envy. The words drifted between them like poison. Would Hou Yi deny others the chance to risk what he himself would not? Feng Meng let the question hang, daring the hero to flinch, his own ambition coiling in the shadows of the room.
Hou Yi's eyes narrow, his hand instinctively resting near his bow as he steps subtly between Feng Meng and the ancient jar on the altar. Hou Yi rose with deliberate care, his every movement measured, though vigilance flickered in his narrowed gaze. Instinctively, his hand drifted near the curve of his bow as he shifted, placing himself between Feng Meng and the ancient jar upon the altar. He met Feng Meng’s gaze unflinchingly, the weight of responsibility anchoring his words. “I do not deny the right to choose, Feng Meng,” he said, voice steady with resolve, “but I will not stand idle if that choice threatens to unleash calamity upon us all.”
The confrontation grows increasingly personal, as Feng Meng accuses Hou Yi of basking in glory and keeping those loyal to him in the shadows.

Hou Yi, sensing further duplicity, moves to secure the quiver inside the armory.

At this point, Feng Meng’s jealousy and sense of injustice boil over.

Hou Yi storms into the room, grabbing Feng Meng’s arm tightly, his eyes narrowed with suspicion and anger. Hou Yi burst into the chamber, his presence as fierce as a gathering storm. Without hesitation, he seized Feng Meng’s arm in an iron grip, the anger in his narrowed eyes barely contained. “Feng Meng! What are you doing here?” he demanded, his voice sharp with suspicion. The room seemed to shrink beneath the force of his gaze as he tightened his hold, unwilling to let any deception slip past him. “Why are you sneaking around my house?” he pressed, each word edged with the weight of his honor and protectiveness. “Speak now—what is it you want?”
Feng Meng struggles against Hou Yi’s grip, his eyes darting nervously toward the inner chamber. Feng Meng twisted desperately in Hou Yi’s iron grip, eyes flickering with unease toward the shadows of the inner chamber. Sweat gleamed at his brow as he stammered, his voice thin and pleading. He insisted he wasn’t sneaking—that he’d come searching for Hou Yi, and when he found the room empty, panic had seized him. “Please,” he gasped, his words tumbling over themselves as he tried to wrench his arm free, “let go of my arm!”
Hou Yi tightens his grip, eyes narrowed, forcing Feng Meng to meet his gaze. Hou Yi burst onto the scene, boots pounding against the earth, every muscle tensed with purpose. His hand shot out, seizing Feng Meng’s arm in a grip that brooked no denial. Eyes narrowed, he stared straight into Feng Meng’s face, holding him fast with the weight of his authority. “Don’t lie to me, Feng Meng,” he demanded, his voice low and edged with the steel of suspicion. “I’ve seen the fear in your eyes—tell me, what have you done while I was gone?”
Feng Meng tries to twist out of Hou Yi’s grip, his voice trembling between defiance and desperation. Feng Meng tried to wrench his arm free from Hou Yi’s iron grasp, his face contorting between defiance and desperation. “I haven’t done anything—yet,” he managed, the words spilling out in a tremulous rush. His eyes flickered with resentment as he glared at Hou Yi. “But you left Chang’e unguarded, and I had to know what secrets you two are hiding from the rest of us.”
Hou Yi tightens his grip, eyes blazing with suspicion as he steps closer, his stance blocking Feng Meng's escape. Hou Yi’s hand shot out, seizing Feng Meng’s arm in a vice-like grip. His eyes blazed with suspicion as he stepped in, planting himself squarely between Feng Meng and any hope of escape. “Secrets?” he demanded, his voice low but edged with steel. “Since when did you become so obsessed with what happens under my roof—tell me, Feng Meng, is it jealousy, or something far darker driving you?” The words came out sharp and swift, fueled by an impulsive mix of anger and concern, as Hou Yi’s honor and protectiveness warred with the chilling sense of betrayal stirring in his chest.
Feng Meng yanks his arm free, eyes blazing with resentment, stepping back as if ready to fight or flee. Feng Meng yanked his arm free from Hou Yi’s iron grip, his eyes blazing with a resentment that had simmered far too long. He stepped back, muscles coiled as if ready to fight or flee, and let out a bitter laugh. "Jealousy?" he spat, his voice edged with scorn. "Call it justice—while you bask in glory and hoard the elixir, the rest of us live in your shadow. I am done waiting for scraps." The words came out in a rush, as if years of envy and wounded pride had finally found their voice.
Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng’s arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps closer, looming over him. Hou Yi burst onto the scene, the chaos in the courtyard sharpening the edge of his temper. Without hesitation, he seized Feng Meng’s arm, his grip iron-strong, the sinews in his forearm taut with fury. He leaned in, towering over Feng Meng, eyes blazing. “Justice?” he spat, the word laced with contempt. “You dare twist your envy into righteousness while you scheme behind my back.” The accusation hung between them, heavy and dangerous. Hou Yi’s voice dropped, trembling with a deeper threat. “If you’ve laid a hand on Chang’e or the elixir,” he warned, his honor and love fueling every syllable, “I swear you’ll answer for it.”
Feng Meng wrenches his arm free, eyes burning with resentment as he squares his shoulders, defiance etched across his face. Feng Meng wrenched his arm free from Hou Yi’s grasp, his eyes burning with a resentment that refused to be concealed. Squaring his shoulders, he met Hou Yi’s gaze with defiance etched across every line of his face. “You think me a thief,” he spat, voice low and trembling with barely contained fury, “but what choice have you left me when you clutch immortality for yourself and cast aside those who fought beside you?” The accusation hung in the air between them, sharp and bitter, as Feng Meng glared at his former master, ambition and betrayal tangled in his posture.
Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng's arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps between Feng Meng and the door to the inner chambers. Hou Yi’s fingers dug into Feng Meng’s arm, his grip unyielding as he planted himself squarely between the intruder and the threshold to the inner chambers. Fury burned in his eyes, but beneath it flickered a deep, personal anguish. “You speak of fighting beside me,” he said, each word measured and heavy with disappointment, “but you forget honor.” His voice trembled with the sting of betrayal. “If you truly believed in justice, you would face me openly—not skulk in shadows and threaten what I hold most dear.” The accusation hung in the air, sharp as any arrow, and Hou Yi’s stance made it clear: he would allow no one, not even an old comrade, to cross the line he’d drawn to protect his home.
Feng Meng wrenches his arm free, eyes blazing with resentment as he squares his stance, defiant and unyielding before Hou Yi. Feng Meng wrenched his arm free from Hou Yi’s iron grip, his eyes blazing with bitter resentment. He squared his stance, refusing to yield, every line of his body tense with defiance. “Honor?” he spat, voice thick with years of envy and hurt. What had honor ever earned him but scars and empty hands? While Hou Yi basked in the adulation of the masses, parading as a hero, Feng Meng had been forced to beg for scraps—what should, by rights, be shared among them all. The words hung in the air between them, sharp as a drawn blade, as Feng Meng glared at his former master, ambition and betrayal warring in his heart.
Hou Yi releases Feng Meng’s arm with a hard shove, his stance rigid and eyes blazing, daring Feng Meng to make his move. Hou Yi released Feng Meng’s arm with a hard shove, his stance rigid and eyes blazing as he towered over him. “If you believe you’ve earned a share, Feng Meng,” he declared, voice taut with challenge, “then step into the light and claim it before my eyes, not by creeping like a thief in the night!” His words cracked through the tense air, daring Feng Meng to meet his gaze and prove his worth openly, rather than skulk in shadows.
Feng Meng wrenches his arm free from Hou Yi’s grip, eyes blazing with resentment as he backs away, poised to defend himself if Hou Yi advances. Feng Meng wrenched his arm free from Hou Yi’s grip, the movement sharp and defiant. His eyes blazed with a resentment that had been simmering for years, and as he backed away, every muscle taut, poised to defend himself should Hou Yi so much as step closer. His voice was low and bitter, barely restrained, yet every word cut deep: if only Hou Yi had recognized the worth of those who stood by his side, Feng Meng spat, perhaps there would have been no need to snatch away what was guarded so jealously. Sometimes, he added, voice thick with accusation and regret, the night was the only refuge left for those abandoned—left out in the cold by the very man they had once called master.
Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng's arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps between Feng Meng and the door to the inner chambers. Hou Yi’s fingers tightened like iron around Feng Meng’s arm, his grip unyielding. Fury smoldered in his gaze as he stepped forward, deliberately placing himself between Feng Meng and the inner chamber’s door. “Enough riddles, Feng Meng,” he demanded, voice taut with barely restrained anger. “If you’ve come for the elixir, say it plainly, and face the consequences of your ambition!” His presence filled the corridor, every muscle tensed with the promise of swift retribution.
Feng Meng wrenches his arm free with a sudden jerk, his eyes blazing as he squares his stance, defiance radiating from every line of his body. With a sudden, violent jerk, Feng Meng tore his arm free from Hou Yi's grasp. His eyes blazed with a fury that had long been festering, and he squared his stance, every muscle taut with defiance. "So be it, Hou Yi—I want the elixir, and I will no longer beg for what I deserve." The words hissed from his lips, bitter and sharp, as he glared at his former master. Ambition and resentment radiated from him, swirling in the charged air between them, making it clear that devotion had given way to something far darker.
He slips into Hou Yi’s private chamber, searching for the elixir while justifying his actions as a pursuit of justice.

Hou Yi catches Feng Meng rifling through his belongings, and a direct confrontation ensues—Hou Yi accuses Feng Meng of betrayal and warns him against harming Chang’e or stealing the elixir.

Feng Meng, feeling wronged and underappreciated, claims he is forced into this position by Hou Yi’s refusal to share what he believes is rightfully his.

The quarrel escalates until Feng Meng shoves Hou Yi aside and escapes, leaving behind a trail of mud and scattered scrolls.

Hou Yi stands amid the disarray, recognizing the depth of Feng Meng’s envy and the seriousness of his apprentice’s betrayal.

----------------------------------------

As the echoes of betrayal faded, Hou Yi rushed through the ruined chamber, his thoughts racing toward Chang'e and the elixir that now lay at the heart of Feng Meng’s desperate scheme. Unbeknownst to him, Chang'e faced her own moment of decision as the threat drew closer, the fate of the elixir—and her own destiny—hanging in the balance.

# Chapter 4: Chang'e Drinks the Elixir

Chang'e stands at the center table, preparing tea and keeping a watchful eye on the porcelain box containing the elixir.

Feng Meng bursts in, visibly distressed and desperate, demanding the box from Chang'e.

Unlike in the original plot, Feng Meng claims to seek the elixir not solely for personal gain but also out of a distorted belief that its misuse could doom them both—though his true ambition and willingness to use force quickly surface.

The confrontation escalates as both accuse each other of dangerous intentions;

Chang'e subtly shifts the ornate box further out of sight with her foot, her eyes never leaving Feng Meng as she straightens her posture and keeps her tone even, masking the tension in her voice. Chang’e’s bare foot, nimble and silent, nudged the ornate box deeper into the shadowed folds of her gown, keeping it just out of sight. Her gaze remained serene, fixed steadily on Feng Meng as he lingered in the doorway, his silhouette long and uncertain in the shifting moonlight. Straightening her spine, she carefully smoothed the tension from her voice, letting her words emerge calm and measured despite the wariness coiling beneath. “Feng Meng, you rarely visit without cause,” she said, her tone gentle but edged with quiet scrutiny. “What brings you here—at this hour?”
Feng Meng steps closer, his gaze fixed on the now-concealed box, voice low with an edge of warning. Feng Meng’s eyes narrowed, the glint of ambition sharpening as he watched Chang’e hastily slide the box out of sight. He stepped closer, his presence unmistakably menacing, and let his voice drop to a warning murmur. “I came for the box you’re hiding, Chang’e; you know there are things inside that belong to me.” The words slithered between them, heavy with accusation and a possessive edge that betrayed his simmering resentment.
Chang'e tightens her grip on the edge of the box, her eyes never leaving Feng Meng as she edges closer to the moonlit doorway. Chang'e’s fingers curled tighter around the edge of the lacquered box, a subtle tremor betraying her effort to remain composed. The moonlight spilled through the doorway, casting Feng Meng’s shadow across the threshold as he approached. She slid the box behind her with practiced calm, her gaze unwavering as she studied his intent. With a voice measured and gentle—yet laced with quiet defiance—she said, “You mistake my keeping for theft.” Her words floated between them, steady as the silver light. “Your claim over this box is no clearer than your reason for wanting it now.” In that moment, Chang’e’s longing and uncertainty mingled with her resolve, every syllable a shield against the loneliness that had become her constant companion.
Feng Meng steps closer, his eyes fixed on the box's barely concealed edge, voice low and threatening. Feng Meng stepped closer, his gaze glued to the box that Chang'e tried to conceal behind her back. Shadows flickered in his eyes, ambition and jealousy twisting his features into something almost unrecognizable. His voice dropped to a low, dangerous murmur, barely more than a whisper, but sharp enough to cut through the tension between them. "My reason is simple," he said, each word deliberate and cold. "Without that box, neither of us will see another sunrise."
Chang'e grips the edge of the box tighter, her eyes narrowed and voice low, poised between defense and demand. Chang’e’s fingers tightened around the edge of the lacquered box, the smooth wood pressing into her palm as she quickly slid it behind her, shielding it from view. Her eyes narrowed, searching his face with a mix of caution and curiosity, the low steadiness of her voice betraying both resolve and vulnerability. “If the stakes are truly life or death,” she said, her words measured yet edged with urgency, “then you must tell me what it is you seek inside this box—and why its contents could threaten us both.” The loneliness of the moon pressed in around her, but Chang’e stood her ground, resourceful as ever, unwilling to yield without understanding the dangers poised between them.
Feng Meng steps closer, eyes fixed on the box, his voice low and urgent as he tries to gauge Chang'e's resolve. Feng Meng stepped closer, his gaze riveted on the lacquered box Chang'e now guarded behind her back. The glint in his eyes sharpened, jealousy twisting his features as he tried to read her resolve. His voice dropped to a low, urgent murmur, edged with resentment. "What you guard so closely is the elixir," he said, the words almost a hiss. "If it falls into the wrong hands, it could doom us all." The accusation hung between them, heavy and unmistakable, as Chang'e straightened, her own voice steady—a shield against the ambition she saw flickering in Feng Meng’s eyes.
Chang'e tightens her grip on the box, eyes narrowed, shifting subtly to block any path Feng Meng might take toward it. Chang’e’s fingers tightened imperceptibly around the box, her knuckles paling as she drew it closer, slipping it behind her in one fluid motion. She shifted her stance, subtly placing herself between Feng Meng and the last remnant of her mortal life. Her voice remained composed, though a tremor of accusation lingered beneath the calm. “Then you admit you’d risk everything for power—who are you protecting, Feng Meng, if not yourself?” The question hung between them, sharp as moonlight on cold stone, her gaze never wavering even as uncertainty coiled in her chest.
Feng Meng steps forward, eyes narrowed, his hand outstretched as if to seize the box by force if words fail. Feng Meng stepped forward, his eyes narrowed to slits as ambition warred with resentment across his face. One hand stretched out, tense and ready to seize the box should words fail him. He fixed Chang’e with a cold, calculated gaze, voice low and urgent. “I protect the order of heaven itself—give me the box, Chang’e, before your doubt destroys us both.” 

Chang’e’s fingers curled protectively around the box, sliding it behind her with practiced subtlety. She kept her voice steady, refusing to betray the flicker of fear in her chest as she met his gaze and quietly asked his purpose, determined to reveal nothing.
Chang'e keeps her back pressed to the box, her eyes narrowed, watching Feng Meng's every movement for a sign of deception. Chang’e pressed her back firmly against the lacquered box, feeling the chill of its surface seep through her silk robes. Her gaze remained fixed on Feng Meng, sharp and unwavering, as she searched his face for the slightest hint of duplicity. With a steady voice that betrayed none of her inner turmoil, she slid the box further out of sight and asked, “If your cause is truly righteous, why must you veil your intentions in threats and shadows, instead of speaking plainly?”
Feng Meng steps forward, gaze fixed on the box, tension tightening his posture as Chang'e's grip on the hidden object tightens in response. Feng Meng stepped forward, his eyes never leaving the ornate box Chang’e guarded so closely. The tension in his shoulders was palpable, a silent battle of wills crackling between them. Sensing his intent, Chang’e’s fingers curled protectively around the hidden object, subtle but unyielding as she slid it behind her, her voice deliberately even when she asked his purpose. Feng Meng’s lips curled in a tight, almost mocking smile. “Perhaps because truth, in your hands, is as dangerous as the elixir itself,” he said, each word edged with resentment, his ambition barely concealed beneath the veneer of civility.
Chang'e rises, holding the box closer, her gaze never leaving Feng Meng as tension crackles in the air. Chang’e rose slowly, the ancient wooden box pressed protectively to her chest, its cool edges digging into her palms. Her gaze never wavered from Feng Meng, watching the hunger in his eyes, the subtle twitch of his fingers as tension rippled between them. Instinct urged her to shield what she held, and with one fluid motion she slid the box behind her, masking it from his view. Her voice, steady but edged with resolve, broke the charged silence. “Then you leave me no choice,” she said quietly, “but to protect what you fear—and what you covet—from both our hands.”
Feng Meng insists he must have the elixir to protect heavenly order (and himself), while Chang'e stands firm, willing to risk everything to keep the elixir from him.

Feng Meng advances another step, his eyes fixed on the vial in Chang'e's trembling hands, his fingers curling into fists as he tries to mask the tremor in his voice with anger. Feng Meng advanced another step, his gaze locked onto the vial clutched in Chang'e's trembling hands. His fingers curled into fists, knuckles whitening as he fought to steady the tremor in his voice, letting anger mask the desperation simmering beneath. "Hand it over, Chang'e. Now." The words came out clipped, almost a hiss, each syllable sharpened by his resentment. He refused to look away, as if sheer force of will could pry the elixir from her grip. "You know that elixir belongs to me—I've come too far to let you steal it," he pressed, urgency snapping at his tone. "Don't make this harder than it has to be."
Chang'e clutches the vial tightly behind her back, her eyes darting toward the door as she edges away from him. Chang’e’s fingers curled protectively around the vial, pressing it to the small of her back as she inched away from Feng Meng. Her heart hammered, breath catching with every step he took closer. His eyes glittered with a desperate hunger, and his voice was sharp with impatience. But Chang’e stood firm, her gaze unwavering even as uncertainty twisted inside her. “The elixir was never yours to claim, Feng Meng,” she said quietly, her tone gentle but edged with resolve. “I won’t let your greed doom us both.”
Feng Meng's fists clench at his sides as he takes another forceful step forward, his eyes narrowing with a mixture of desperation and anger. Feng Meng’s fists clenched tightly at his sides as he took another forceful step toward her, jaw set, eyes burning with a mixture of desperation and simmering anger. “Don’t play innocent, Chang’e,” he spat, voice clipped and urgent. “Without that elixir, everything I’ve sacrificed is for nothing, and I won’t let you ruin it!” The words cut through the tense silence, his resentment barely contained as he glared at her, every muscle taut with ambition and betrayal.
Chang'e clutches the vial to her chest, her voice trembling but her gaze unwavering as she edges backward, putting distance between them. Chang'e clutched the vial tightly against her chest, feeling the cool glass press into her trembling fingers. She took a cautious step back, widening the gap between herself and Feng Meng, whose shadow stretched menacingly across the moonlit chamber. Her voice wavered, but her eyes remained steady, refusing to yield. If only he could grasp the truth—Chang'e's words came out low and urgent, edged with sorrow: if he truly understood what this elixir could unleash, he would fear it just as fiercely as he craved its power.
Feng Meng lunges forward, eyes locked on the vial in Chang'e's trembling hands. Feng Meng’s eyes burned with a feverish intensity as he lunged forward, every muscle tensed with anticipation. The vial quivered in Chang’e’s trembling hands, but he paid her fear no heed. “Fear is for the weak, Chang’e—I won’t be denied what I deserve,” he snapped, voice clipped and urgent. The words cut through the heavy air, his ambition coiling around them like a snare as he stepped closer, shadows flickering across his face.
Chang'e clutches the elixir close, her gaze unwavering as she steps back, placing a trembling hand between them as a final barrier. Chang'e clutched the elixir to her chest, her gaze unwavering even as she retreated a step, the silk of her sleeve trembling with the motion of her raised hand—a final, fragile barrier between herself and Feng Meng. He advanced, his eyes sharp with hunger, his voice clipped as he demanded what was not his to claim. Yet Chang'e refused to yield. Gentle but resolute, she fixed her eyes on him, the pain of betrayal mingling with her determination. "Deserve?" she asked quietly, her words edged with sorrow. "You seek only power, Feng Meng, but I will not let your ambition destroy us all."
Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes wild with desperation as he reaches for Chang'e's hand. Feng Meng lurched forward, desperation blazing in his eyes as he reached for Chang'e's trembling hand. His voice, sharp and brittle with resentment, sliced through the tense air. "Enough stalling—give me the elixir, or I'll take it by force!" The threat in his words was unmistakable, his ambition and jealousy burning just beneath the surface as he closed the distance between them, every muscle taut with intent.
Chang'e steps back, clutching the vial tightly to her chest, her gaze unwavering despite the fear flickering in her eyes. Chang’e took an unsteady step back, the cool glass of the vial pressed tight against her chest. Though fear flickered in her eyes, her gaze never left Feng Meng’s advancing figure. He moved closer, desperation sharpening his features, his voice taut with urgency as he demanded the elixir. Chang’e’s voice was steady, though it trembled at the edges with conviction and dread. “You’d threaten violence over what you barely comprehend,” she said, her words quiet but unwavering. “But I will protect this elixir with my life if I must.” The weight of her resolve hung between them, more formidable than any weapon Feng Meng might wield.
Feng Meng clenches his fists and takes another step forward, his eyes burning with impatience and menace. Feng Meng’s fists clenched at his sides, the veins in his hands standing out starkly as he stepped closer, impatience flickering like fire behind his narrowed eyes. He regarded Chang’e with a cold, resentful glare, his voice clipped as he warned, "Don't test me, Chang'e—I won't hesitate to do what it takes to get what should be mine." The words cut through the tense silence, edged with menace and the desperate ambition that had festered within him for so long.
Chang'e clutches the elixir tight to her chest, her eyes flashing with fierce determination as she steps back, poised to flee or fight. Chang’e’s fingers tightened around the elixir, the glass vial pressed hard against her chest as if it alone could shield her from the darkness gathering in Feng Meng’s eyes. He advanced, each step a threat, his voice clipped and urgent as he demanded what was never meant for him. She felt the cold marble of the chamber against her bare heels as she retreated, heart pounding—a wild, desperate rhythm echoing her resolve. Fierce determination flared in her gaze, her body poised to flee or fight, and her voice—quiet but unyielding—cut through the thickening air: “Then you leave me no choice, Feng Meng—I would rather risk everything than see such power in your hands.”
Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes wild and desperate, reaching for the elixir with trembling hands. Feng Meng’s breath came in ragged spurts as he advanced, the flickering lamplight catching in his wild, desperate eyes. His hands shook, knuckles whitening as he reached toward the tiny vial clutched in Chang’e’s grasp. Jealousy and ambition twisted his features into something almost unrecognizable. Voice clipped and urgent, he spat the words like a curse, every syllable trembling with resentment. “You think I won’t cross that line, Chang’e?” His gaze never left the elixir, hunger and betrayal battling within him. “Watch me—I'd rather see the world burn than walk away empty-handed.”
Chang'e tightens her grip on the elixir, her gaze unwavering as she takes a defiant step back, placing herself between Feng Meng and the precious vial. Chang’e’s fingers tightened around the cool glass of the elixir, her knuckles paling as she drew a careful, deliberate step backward. The pale moonlight caught in her eyes, turning them hard and bright as she fixed her gaze on Feng Meng. He advanced, tense and hungry, the demand in his voice sharp as a blade. She stood her ground, body poised between him and the shimmering vial—an unspoken shield. 

“If you force my hand, Feng Meng,” she said quietly, her voice steady despite the tremor in her chest, “I will do what must be done—even if it means you lose everything you ever sought to gain.” The words were not a threat, but a promise born of desperation and love, echoing in the charged silence that stretched between them.
Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes blazing, hands outstretched toward the elixir clutched in Chang'e's trembling grip. Feng Meng lunged forward, his eyes blazing with a feverish intensity as he closed the distance between them. His hands reached out, fingers curled and desperate, toward the elixir that Chang’e clutched in her trembling grip. “Give it to me now, Chang’e,” he demanded, his voice clipped and sharp, every word edged with resentment. “Or I’ll tear it from your grasp—don’t mistake my desperation for mercy.” The threat hung in the air, heavy and real, as his ambition and jealousy twisted his features into something unrecognizable.
Chang'e clutches the elixir tighter, her eyes blazing with defiance as she steps back, placing herself between Feng Meng and the only escape. Chang’e’s grip tightened around the elixir, the fragile vial trembling beneath her fingers as she drew a measured breath. She stepped back, quietly but firmly placing herself between Feng Meng and the only escape, her silken sleeves whispering against the cold stone floor. Though fear coiled in her chest, it was defiance that lit her eyes as she met his gaze. If he wanted the elixir, he would have to reach for it himself—and she would not yield easily. “You may take it from my hands,” she told him, her voice steady and low, “only if you are prepared to meet the consequences, Feng Meng.”
Feng Meng takes another menacing step forward, his hand reaching for the hilt of his blade, eyes burning with ruthless determination. Feng Meng advanced, each deliberate step shrinking the distance between him and Chang'e. His fingers curled around the hilt of his blade, knuckles blanching with tension. The hunger in his eyes was unmistakable—ruthless, burning with ambition and resentment that had long festered in his heart. His voice, clipped and urgent, cut through the charged silence as he demanded, "You're not the only one willing to risk everything, Chang'e." The words hung in the air, heavy with threat. He paused, letting the menace seep in before continuing, "So choose: surrender the elixir, or watch what your defiance unleashes." The ultimatum was clear—Feng Meng would not be denied, and the choice he offered was laced with peril.
Their exchange grows more emotional and intense, with Chang'e showing fear and desperation as Feng Meng threatens and approaches.

Chang'e steps away from Feng Meng, eyes wide with fear. As he lunges toward her, his arm sweeps across the table, knocking over a teacup. Hot tea splashes onto the floor, the sharp smell rising between them, tension thick in the air. Chang’e stumbled back, her heart pounding, eyes wide as she fixed them on Feng Meng. “Stay back, Feng Meng! I told you—I won’t give you the elixir. Please, don’t come any closer!” Her voice trembled, both pleading and resolute. As she spoke, Feng Meng lunged forward, desperation twisting his features, his arm sweeping across the table. A porcelain teacup clattered to the floor, shattering the quiet with a sharp crack. Hot tea splashed onto the cold tiles, its bitter scent curling up between them, mingling with the thick tension that filled the air.
Feng Meng's voice trembles with urgency as he rushes forward, his arm sweeping the table and sending the teacup crashing to the ground, hot tea splattering between them. Feng Meng’s voice quivered with desperation as he surged forward, his jealousy crackling just beneath the surface. In a single, reckless motion, his arm swept across the table, sending the delicate teacup tumbling to the floor. The crash was sharp, and hot tea splattered across the polished wood and onto the space between them. He barely seemed to notice, his gaze fixed on Chang’e as she recoiled from him. “You don’t understand, Chang’e—I need that elixir!” The words tore from him, raw and urgent, as if the confession alone might bridge the chasm of mistrust and resentment widening between them.
Chang'e stumbles backward, her hand trembling as the teacup tumbles from the table, its contents splattering across the floor between them. Chang'e’s breath caught as she stumbled backward, her hand trembling so violently that the delicate teacup slipped from her grasp. Porcelain struck wood with a sharp crack, the cup tumbling to the floor, where hot liquid splattered between them in chaotic arcs. She pressed herself against the wall, voice quivering as she pleaded, "No, Feng Meng—you're scaring me!" The words trembled in the charged air, her fear as raw and unmistakable as the tea pooling at her feet.
Feng Meng lunges forward, knocking over a teacup, hot liquid splashing onto the floor. With a snarl twisting his lips, Feng Meng surged forward, his sleeve catching the edge of the lacquered table. The porcelain teacup toppled, spilling a scalding sheet of tea across the floor, but he paid it no mind. Eyes burning with resentment, he fixed Chang'e with a hard glare. "Give it to me now, Chang'e," he hissed, the words sharp as a drawn blade. "Or I'll take it by force."
Chang'e stumbles backward, clutching the elixir tightly as Feng Meng lunges forward, his arm sweeping across the table and sending a teacup crashing to the floor, hot tea splattering across their feet. Chang'e stumbled backward, her knuckles white around the tiny vial, as Feng Meng's lunge swept across the table. Porcelain shattered; hot tea splashed onto her bare feet, and the sting of it barely registered through her panic. Desperately, she pleaded, voice trembling as she pressed herself against the wall, “No—please, don’t do this!” Her heart hammered, torn between fear and the memory of gentler days, as Feng Meng’s shadow loomed closer, relentless and unyielding.
Feng MengHe lunges forward, his arm knocking over a teacup, sending hot liquid splashing onto the floor as Chang'e recoils in fear. Feng Meng’s eyes flashed with a venomous intensity as Chang’e stepped back, fear flickering across her face. In a sudden, desperate lunge, his arm swept across the table, knocking over a porcelain teacup. Scalding liquid splattered onto the floor between them, the sharp scent of tea mingling with the tension in the air. “I warned you, Chang’e—this is your last chance!” he hissed, his voice low and threatening, every word edged with resentment and wounded pride.
Chang'e stumbles backward, eyes wide with terror, as Feng Meng lunges forward, his arm sweeping across the table and knocking over a teacup, sending hot liquid splashing onto the floor. Chang’e stumbled backward, her heart pounding, eyes wide in terror as Feng Meng lunged at her. His arm swept across the low table in his haste, sending a teacup clattering to the floor—porcelain shattering, hot liquid splattering across the stone tiles. Fear twisted inside her, but her voice rang out, trembling and resolute: "No—I'd rather die than let you have it!"
Feng MengHe lunges forward, knocking over a teacup; hot liquid splashes onto the floor as Chang'e stumbles back in terror. Feng Meng’s eyes flashed, a storm of resentment twisting his features as Chang’e retreated, clutching the delicate vial close to her chest. In one swift, reckless motion, he lunged forward, sending the teacup clattering to the ground; scalding liquid splashed across the polished floor as Chang’e stumbled back in terror. His voice was low and sharp, vibrating with ambition and fury: “Fine—if you won’t give it to me, I’ll take it myself!”
Chang'e, cornered and realizing that Feng Meng would use any means necessary to take the elixir, ultimately chooses to drink it herself, unleashing its power, as a last resort to keep it from falling into his hands.

The magical transformation begins as in the original plot, with the cottage filling with light and wind, but the dialogue reveals deeper conflict and emotional stakes between the two.

----------------------------------------

As the dazzling radiance faded and the winds settled, Chang'e's form drifted ever higher, leaving behind the turmoil and heartbreak of the world below. The earth grew distant, her home receding into memory, as she surrendered to the pull of the elixir's magic. In that suspended moment between sky and stars, Chang'e found herself drawn inexorably toward a new, unfamiliar destiny—one that would soon reveal itself in the silent, silver expanse above.

# Chapter 5: Chang'e Arrives on the Moon

Jade Rabbit hops to the center of the chamber, dragging a heavy stone pestle.

He pours crushed herbs into the mortar, then gestures for Chang'e to help.

Chang'e rolls up her sleeves and presses her palm to the cool stone, grinding the mixture with steady force.

As they work, Jade Rabbit ponders aloud about the meaning of the moon's tasks and the significance of the keys, questioning whether holding them is a sign of honor or if they bestow special powers.

After sampling a pinch of the powder and nodding approvingly, Jade Rabbit opens a hidden alcove in the wall, revealing a set of shimmering keys, and nudges them toward Chang'e.

'Only those who complete the moon's tasks may hold these,' he says, his words now tinged with thoughtful curiosity.

Jade Rabbit tilts his head thoughtfully, ears twitching with curiosity as he studies the speaker, eager to understand more about the challenge and its rewards. Jade Rabbit’s ears twitched, eyes glinting with secret amusement as she traced a paw along the moon’s silvery surface. “The moon’s tasks,” she mused, voice lilting with ancient wisdom and a hint of playful mischief. “They must be rare and difficult, then.” She paused, gaze drifting toward the distant Earth as if weighing invisible scales. “If only a few can complete them, what does it truly mean to ‘hold these’?” Her tone softened, more contemplative now, as she settled back into the lunar dust. “Is it a sign of honor, or does it grant some special power?” Even as she spoke, the air around her seemed to shimmer with unspoken secrets, the moonlight itself bending to the will of its enigmatic guardian.
Chang'e collects the keys, the chamber vibrating with new energy as she prepares for her next challenge.

----------------------------------------

As Chang'e clutches the keys and the chamber trembles with anticipation, far below on the earth, another story is unfolding. Hou Yi, her beloved, senses the shift in fate and refuses to remain idle in the face of her absence. While Chang'e steels herself for the trials ahead on the moon, Hou Yi gazes upward, his heart heavy with longing, determined to seek help from the heavens themselves. Thus, as Chang'e embarks on her lunar quest, the threads of devotion and destiny begin to intertwine, setting the stage for Hou Yi's desperate appeal.

# Chapter 6: Hou Yi Pleads with the Heavens

Hou Yi kneels before the gates of the Celestial Palace, pouring his heart out in a passionate plea to the Heavens, invoking not only his own suffering but the suffering of all mortals as he begs for Chang'e's return.

The Heavenly Envoy, maintaining his formal composure, reminds Hou Yi that such a request can only be answered by the Jade Emperor, and instructs him to rise.

Hou Yi apologizes for his emotional outburst and acknowledges the Envoy's limited authority, demonstrating humility and understanding.

Hou Yi falls to his knees beneath the vast sky, tears gleaming in his eyes, arms outstretched in supplication as his voice echoes with raw, desperate hope. "Heavens above, I, Hou Yi, kneel before your boundless might. My heart aches with every beat for my beloved Chang'e, torn from my side by fate's cruel hand. I have vanquished the suns, saved the mortal realm from ruin, yet my soul knows no peace without her. I beg you, not for glory nor reward, but for love—a love as enduring as the mountains, as deep as the rivers. Have mercy, O august ones! Restore my wife to me. Let compassion move you, for the sake of all mortals who yearn and grieve, as I do now." ——Hou Yi

He then formally presents his bow as a token of respect and a sign of his willingness to accept any trial, not only to the Envoy but also in front of the assembled celestial court.

Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy closes the scroll with deliberate care, his gaze unwavering as he addresses Hou Yi, voice firm and resolute, allowing no room for negotiation. The Heavenly Envoy’s eyes narrowed, his expression inscrutable as he carefully rolled the scroll closed. Each movement was measured, deliberate, betraying not the slightest tremor of hesitation. He fixed his unwavering gaze upon Hou Yi, the weight of celestial authority pressing into the silence. “Hou Yi, enough,” he commanded, his tone firm and leaving no room for protest. With a subtle gesture, he indicated for Hou Yi to rise and compose himself. “Your plea is weighty,” he continued, voice steady and resolute, “but the decree of Heaven is not mine to bestow. Only the Jade Emperor himself may grant what you seek. Such is the order of the Celestial Court, and I am bound to uphold it.” The finality in his words was as unyielding as the heavens themselves.
Hou Yi bows his head deeply, hands clasped in humility, retreating a step to show respect. Hou Yi bowed his head deeply, hands clasped in humility, and retreated a respectful step. The Envoy narrowed his eyes, the parchment scroll snapping shut in his grasp as he commanded Hou Yi to rise, reminding him that only the Jade Emperor could decide his fate. Suppressing the urgency burning in his chest, Hou Yi forced his voice steady, the weight of his desperation evident despite his reverence. “Forgive my boldness, Envoy,” he said, acknowledging the breach of decorum. “My desperation outweighs my manners, but I understand the limits of your authority and will await the Jade Emperor’s judgment.” The words hung in the air—a mixture of humble submission and the fierce determination that had brought him before the gods.
The gates open, and Hou Yi enters the palace, ready to make his case before the Jade Emperor, with the Envoy and other celestial officials observing to ensure proper protocol is followed.

Hou Yi bows deeply, presenting his bow with both hands, gaze lowered in deference. Hou Yi stepped forward, his movements deliberate and unhurried. He bowed deeply, lowering his gaze in deference to the assembled immortals and mortals alike. With both hands, he offered up his bow—a weapon once renowned for feats of valor, now transformed in his grasp into a symbol of humility.  

“I do not come before you as a hero,” he declared, his voice steady but edged with the weight of his calling. “I am merely a humble servant of the people.” The bow trembled slightly in his hands, not from fear, but from the magnitude of what it now represented. “Let this bow stand as a sign of my respect, and my willingness to accept whatever trial you deem just.”  

A hush settled over the assembly as Hou Yi squared his shoulders, the lines of determination etched deeply into his face. “My heart is steadfast, my spirit prepared,” he continued, meeting the council’s gaze at last. “Let your judgment guide me. Whatever challenge lies ahead, I will face it with unwavering resolve.”
----------------------------------------

As Hou Yi’s final plea fades into the hush of the assembled gods, his fate hangs uncertain, suspended between humility and the judgment of celestial powers. Far above, the moon’s silver light shimmers—its distant surface home to another soul bound by consequence and longing. While Yi awaits the trial decreed by the Queen Mother, Chang’e herself is poised to confront the hidden guardians of the moon, whose ancient duty tests not only her isolation, but the choices that led her to this exile. As the heavens weigh Hou Yi’s heart, Chang’e must face her own reckoning beneath the watchful gaze of lunar sentinels.

# Chapter 7: Chang'e Faces the Moon Guardians

Chang'e, her silken robes trailing through the moon dust, approaches the towering gate of the inner palace.

She pauses, feeling the cold grit beneath her bare feet, and raises her hand to knock on the crystalline doors.

The Jade Rabbit, alert and twitching his nose, leaps from a nearby boulder and blocks her path, his ears flicking in warning as he says, 'Only those who uphold the moon’s order may pass, Lady Chang’e.

' Without hesitation, Chang’e kneels and presents the moonflower she has cultivated in exile, offering it as proof of her growth and intent to restore balance.

From the mist, two Moon Guardians emerge, their silver armor reflecting the lunar glow.

One Guardian steps forward, extending a staff that hums with celestial energy, and demands Chang’e answer three riddles before the gate will open.

Jade Rabbit circles Chang’e, sniffing the moonflower and watching her reactions.

Chang’e, motivated by her longing to regain agency over her fate and return to Hou Yi, listens, considers, and answers each riddle with careful logic and humility.

Satisfied, the Guardians raise their staffs, parting the palace gates with a resonant clang.

Chang’e, guided by Jade Rabbit’s nod, steps forward into the inner sanctum, having earned the right to seek an audience with the Queen Mother of the West.

The crisp scent of ice and the faint trace of jasmine linger as the doors close behind her.

----------------------------------------

The echo of the gates fading into silence leaves Chang’e alone with her thoughts, the weight of her journey pressing against her heart. Each step she takes into the sanctum draws her closer to the moment she has yearned for—yet she cannot ignore the bargain she made, nor the impossible task that awaits. As the shadows flicker along the ancient walls, anticipation and uncertainty entwine, preparing her for a reunion that will demand more than longing: it will require a choice that could shape the fate of both heaven and earth.

# Chapter 8: The Reunion and the Choice

Hou Yi ascends the marble steps towards the moon gate, where Chang'e waits with the silver key.

The Jade Rabbit and Moon Guardians challenge the couple, requiring proof of Hou Yi's intentions and Chang'e's devotion.

Chang'e offers her own spirit as collateral and swears an oath to uphold the Moon's harmony, deepening her agency and commitment.

Hou Yi answers the Jade Rabbit's riddles, demonstrating wisdom and love as his guiding force.

The Guardians permit Hou Yi to pass, but demand that only one may return to earth.

Chang'e steps forward, kneeling with grace as she presents the shimmering key in her outstretched hands, her gaze unwavering as she addresses the Guardians. Chang’e moved with measured grace, each step echoing the quiet dignity she wore like silk. She knelt before the Guardians, the shimmering key cradled in her outstretched hands, its glow casting delicate patterns across her pale fingers. Her gaze never faltered, steady and resolute despite the tremor of longing that pulsed beneath her calm exterior. The words she spoke emerged as a gentle plea, shaped by both hope and necessity. She addressed the Guardians with reverence, acknowledging their authority even as her heart ached with uncertainty. 

She explained that she came bearing not only the key but also a request that weighed heavily upon her—passage for Hou Yi, whose journey, she insisted, held significance beyond their own fates, touching the very balance of all realms. Chang’e’s voice was soft but unwavering as she assured them of Hou Yi’s pure intentions and the undeniable necessity of his presence. With a final, earnest tilt of her head, she entreated them to consider her plea, the sincerity in her gaze as luminous as the artifact she offered.
Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian steps forward, her eyes narrowed with cautious scrutiny as she studies both the key in Chang'e's hand and her unwavering expression. Guardian Lian stepped forward, her presence both commanding and inscrutable. Her gaze lingered on the slender key clasped in Chang’e’s hand, then rose to meet the goddess’s unwavering eyes. “Lady Chang’e,” Lian began, her voice a measured current beneath the hush of the lunar air, “you understand our duty—to preserve the sanctity of the Moon.” She surveyed Chang’e’s resolute face, searching for any flicker of doubt. “How can we be certain that Hou Yi’s arrival will not tip the scales or invite peril upon our realm?” The question hung in the silver-lit silence, weighted with centuries of vigilance and the burden of their charge.
Chang'e bows deeply, her hands clasped tightly around the key, meeting the Guardians' gaze without wavering. Chang’e bowed deeply, the key pressed tight between her palms, its cool weight grounding her trembling resolve. She met Guardian Lian’s gaze—steady, unwavering, though longing flickered beneath the surface. “I would not risk the Moon’s safety lightly,” she assured, her voice gentle but firm, each word measured with the careful intelligence she had learned through solitude. The promise lingered in the air, binding her to Hou Yi’s mission and its uncertain outcome. “Hou Yi seeks only to restore what has been fractured,” she continued, her eyes never leaving Lian’s, “and if he falters, I vow to answer for his actions.” The words, spoken with the certainty of someone who had lost much, hung between them—an offering, a plea, and a promise entwined.
Moon GuardiansGuardian Wei steps forward, his staff glowing faintly as he regards Chang'e with narrowed eyes, the air thick with anticipation. Guardian Wei stepped forward, the silvered staff in his hand pulsing with a quiet, spectral light that seemed to draw the shadows closer. His gaze, sharp and unreadable, settled on Chang’e as she held out the key, her posture unwavering. For a moment, silence pressed heavily between them, charged with the weight of ancient duty. Slowly, Wei’s eyes narrowed. “Words alone cannot guarantee safety, Lady Chang’e,” he intoned, his voice as measured as the phases of the moon. “What assurance can you offer that Hou Yi’s presence will not awaken forces beyond our control?” The air between them grew taut, as if the very moonlight awaited her reply.
Chang'e bows deeply, presenting the key with both hands as a sign of her unwavering commitment. Chang’e stepped forward, her silken sleeves whispering against the marble floor as she bowed deeply before the assembled Guardians. With both hands, she presented the key—a symbol of trust and consequence—her delicate fingers steady despite the storm of uncertainty within her heart. Her gaze met Guardian Wei’s, luminous yet resolute. “Guardian Wei,” she began, her voice gentle but unwavering, “I offer my own spirit as collateral. Should Hou Yi’s presence ever threaten the Moon, I will surrender myself to your judgment, without a moment’s hesitation.” The words hung in the air, solemn and binding, a testament to her devotion and the quiet strength she drew from longing and loss.
Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian’s eyes narrow, her hand tightening around her staff as moonlight flickers in the chamber. Guardian Lian’s eyes narrowed, the moonlight flickering across her impassive features as her grip tightened around the silvered staff. She regarded Chang’e with a gaze that seemed to pierce through mortal hopes and fears alike. “Your devotion is clear, Lady Chang’e,” she intoned, her voice echoing softly through the luminous chamber. “Yet even the noblest intentions may unleash unforeseen consequences.” The question hung in the air, cool and weighty as moonlit mist. “Can you promise us that Hou Yi’s heart remains unshadowed by vengeance or regret?”
Chang'e meets the Guardians' gaze unwaveringly, her grip tightening on the key as moonlight glimmers around her, signaling her unwavering resolve. Chang'e met Guardian Lian's gaze without hesitation, her slender fingers curling more tightly around the ancient key. Silver moonlight haloed her, illuminating the gentle strength in her eyes. "I have looked into Hou Yi’s heart," she said, her voice as steady as the light surrounding her, "and found only courage and sorrow." She paused, letting the weight of her words settle between them. "He comes not for vengeance, but for healing. If doubt or darkness arises, I stand ready to guide him." The resolve in her posture matched the conviction in her words, and as she stepped forward, presenting the key, it was clear she would not be swayed from her purpose.
Moon GuardiansGuardian Wei steps forward, her silver staff glowing faintly as the other Guardians exchange wary glances, the air thick with uncertainty and expectation. Guardian Wei stepped forward, the silver staff in her grasp casting pale ripples of light across the marble floor. The other Moon Guardians exchanged wary glances, their inscrutable faces betraying only the faintest flicker of uncertainty as the air thickened with expectation. Chang'e held out the key, her voice unwavering as she made her request. Wei regarded her for a long moment, gaze unblinking and impassive.

"The Moon has endured countless trials," Wei finally said, her words ringing with the quiet authority of someone accustomed to standing on the threshold between worlds. "Why should we place our trust in a mortal, even one so lauded as yourself, when the cost of failure could be the unraveling of all that we guard?" The question hung in the charged silence, echoing not only through the chambers but in the hearts of all who stood witness to Chang'e's petition.
Chang'e meets the Guardians' gaze unwaveringly, her hands clasping the key tightly as moonlight gleams around her, underscoring the gravity of her words. Chang’e met the Guardians’ gaze without flinching, her slender fingers tightening around the cold, intricate key. The moonlight traced delicate arcs across her face, casting her in a silvery resolve that seemed to hush the chamber. She stepped forward, the veil of solitude she wore every night shimmering behind her, and lifted her chin, voice unwavering. Hou Yi’s courage and humility, she reminded them, had already saved worlds. Only with his strength—tempered by their guidance—could the peril threatening the Moon be undone. The gravity of her words hung in the luminous air, as if the ancient stones themselves paused to listen.
Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian steps forward, her staff glowing softly as the other Guardians gather, awaiting Chang'e's reply. Guardian Lian stepped forward, the silver filigree of her staff pulsing with an inner luminescence. The other Moon Guardians formed a silent, watchful ring, their faces inscrutable as they waited for Chang’e’s response. Lian’s voice was calm and resonant, echoing across the alabaster stones. She regarded Chang’e with an unreadable gaze and said, “If we grant this passage, Lady Chang’e, you and Hou Yi must swear an oath before the silver gates.” Her words hung in the air, weighty and irrefutable. “You must vow to uphold the Moon’s harmony above all else—and accept the consequences should balance be broken.”

The staff’s glow intensified, as if underscoring the gravity of the promise being demanded. In the hush that followed, the gathered Guardians awaited Chang’e’s answer, the moonlight itself seeming to pause with them.
Chang'e kneels reverently before the silver gates, offering the key with both hands and meeting the Guardians' gaze with unwavering resolve. Chang'e knelt before the towering silver gates, the moonlight pooling around her like a silken mantle. With both hands, she offered the intricate key, her fingers steady despite the thrum of uncertainty in her chest. Meeting the Guardians’ gaze—ancient and unwavering—she drew a quiet breath, letting resolve settle over her gentle features. In a voice as clear as moonlight, she swore upon her soul and heart that she and Hou Yi would uphold the Moon’s harmony above all else. Whatever judgment the Guardians deemed necessary to restore balance, Chang'e silently accepted, her reverence echoing through the hush of the lunar court.
In the face of this ultimatum, Hou Yi and Chang'e openly express their anguish and longing, debating who should bear the burden of separation.

Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit circles Hou Yi with nimble hops, pausing to sniff at the hem of his cloak. Its whiskers twitch as it peers up, eyes gleaming with mischief and ancient wisdom. The Jade Rabbit hopped in tight, nimble circles around Hou Yi, each movement deliberate and light as moonlight itself. Pausing, it pressed its nose to the fringe of his weathered cloak, whiskers quivering with curiosity and a hint of sly amusement. Then, tilting its head, eyes shimmering with secrets older than the stars, it fixed Hou Yi with an appraising stare. “Ah, hero of a thousand arrows,” the Rabbit mused, its voice as soft as distant bells yet edged with playful challenge, “do you know why the moon wears shadows like a veil? Or is it you who brings the darkness with every step?” The air seemed to thicken with enchantment as the Rabbit waited, clearly expecting an answer. “Answer, if your heart is as fearless as your legend claims.”
Hou Yi stands tall, meeting the Jade Rabbit's gaze with steady determination, his hand tightening around his bow as if drawing strength from the memory of Chang'e.

Moon riddles spilled from the Rabbit’s lips, enigmas meant to test his resolve. Hou Yi met its gaze without flinching, his grip tightening, drawing strength from the memory of Chang’e—the promise that fueled every step. The moon’s shadows, he thought, were not of his doing. Like hope itself, they clung to the places light could not reach. Yet he searched only for the path that would lead him back to his beloved, undaunted by the trials the night conjured before him.
Jade Rabbit tilts its head, circling Hou Yi's feet, its whiskers twitching as if sensing the weight of every answer. Jade Rabbit cocked its head, eyes gleaming with secret knowledge as it wove slow, deliberate circles around Hou Yi’s feet. Its whiskers quivered, brushing against the hem of his cloak, as though searching for the truth hidden in his heart. Pausing, the rabbit looked up at him, voice soft and riddling, yet edged with a hint of mischief: "Yet what path is true, archer—one that leads to longing or one that ends in forgetting?" The question hung in the cool lunar air, weighty and mysterious, as if the rabbit itself measured every word for hidden meaning.
Hou Yi clenches his fist, meeting the Jade Rabbit's gaze as the moonlight glimmers on his trembling hand. Hou Yi clenched his fist, feeling the tremor of emotion as the moonlight glimmered across his knuckles. The Jade Rabbit circled him and Chang’e, its silver nose twitching at Hou Yi’s travel-worn cloak, murmuring riddles that twisted and tested his resolve. Hou Yi met the creature’s gaze, unwavering. Longing, he knew, was what kept his feet moving forward, even when the ground seemed lost beneath swirling mist. To forget—he felt it deep in his chest—would be to turn to stone, and he was still flesh, still hope. He stood tall, letting the echo of that truth steady him as the moon’s pale glow bathed the silent garden.
Jade Rabbit twitches its nose, circling Hou Yi with a sly glimmer in its eyes, paws tracing silent patterns on the moonlit ground.

Its paws traced silent, intricate patterns across the moonlit dust, leaving faint marks that shimmered in the silvery light. Pausing just beside Hou Yi’s cloak, the rabbit sniffed at the fabric, whiskers quivering as though testing for hidden truths. Then, with a sly tilt of its head, it murmured in a voice threaded with riddles, “If hope is your lantern, tell me this: what grows fuller the more you take away?” The question hung in the lunar air, as enigmatic and ancient as the moon itself.

The creature circled, nose twitching against Hou Yi’s weathered cloak, its whiskers brushing the fabric as it muttered riddles in a voice that seemed woven from moonlight and mist. Pausing, the Jade Rabbit cocked its head and spoke softly, “A hole grows fuller the more you take away.” The words hung in the cool night air—enigmatic, meant as a test.

Hou Yi’s chest tightened. He watched the moon’s pale glow spill across the earth, remembering Chang’e’s absence with every heartbeat. “Just as my heart grows heavier with every night I spend without Chang’e,” he murmured, the confession slipping out, equal parts riddle and truth. His honor demanded honesty, even if the pain made his voice rougher than he intended. The Jade Rabbit’s eyes lingered on him, as if weighing the depth of his longing and the strength of his resolve.
Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit circles closer, its ears flickering with amusement as it carves a winding pattern in the moon dust at Hou Yi's feet. The Jade Rabbit circled ever nearer, its silvery paws tracing elaborate spirals in the moon dust at Hou Yi’s feet. Mischief danced in its eyes as it paused to sniff at the hem of Hou Yi’s cloak, ears flickering with silent laughter. With a sly tilt of its head, the guardian murmured, half to itself and half as a challenge, “Hm, quick-witted and heavy-hearted—perhaps you are not so easily emptied, Hou Yi.” The rabbit’s whiskers twitched as its voice slipped into a riddle, weaving old moonlight and curiosity together. “But tell me, can you name the thing that always runs, yet never leaves its bed?”

The Jade Rabbit circled him, whiskers twitching, pausing to sniff the edge of Hou Yi’s weathered cloak. Unfazed by the cryptic riddles muttered under the Rabbit’s breath, Hou Yi let out a breath, his thoughts drifting to the rivers he’d crossed and the love that anchored him. “A river runs without rest,” he murmured, the words weaving through the moonlit silence, “yet its bed is the only home it knows—like my love, restless but bound to its purpose.” The admission lingered between them, earnest and unyielding, as Hou Yi’s hand hovered near his bow, the gods’ scrutiny pressing against his shoulders, but his heart remaining steadfastly true.

As it drew nearer, the rabbit sniffed at the archer’s cloak, breath stirring ancient magic in the air, and muttered moon riddles under its breath. Testing Hou Yi’s resolve, the guardian paused, voice low and clear as the frost on autumn grass: “One last riddle, archer,” it intoned, the words curling around the night like smoke. “What can you break without ever touching, and will you dare its answer?”
Hou Yi meets the Jade Rabbit’s gaze, voice steady but eyes shadowed by longing, clutching the cloak tighter as if it anchors him to his vow.

The Jade Rabbit circled him and Chang’e, whiskers twitching, muttering moon riddles beneath its breath while its nose pressed inquisitively at Hou Yi’s cloak. Yet Hou Yi did not flinch. He murmured, more to himself than to the celestial creature, that a promise could unravel without a single hand laid upon it—and that, no matter what riddles the Jade Rabbit spun, he dared not break his word to Chang’e.
Rather than making a swift choice, they seek a way to share the burden or defy fate together, but the Guardians warn that defiance means oblivion.

Hou Yi bows deeply, his voice steady and sincere. The Jade Rabbit studies him for a silent moment, then nods in solemn approval. At this signal, the Moon Guardians lower their spears, their faces softening, allowing Hou Yi to step forward toward his next challenge. Hou Yi bowed deeply, the weight of his longing pressing on his chest, but his voice remained steady and sincere. He met the unblinking gaze of the Jade Rabbit, knowing the creature saw straight through to the ache in his heart. “Great Jade Rabbit, my journey has been long, and my heart heavy with longing,” he began, each word resonant with both fatigue and hope. The memories of a thousand trials—storm and fire, arrow and shadow—flashed behind his eyes. “I have braved a thousand trials, not for glory, but for the hope of reuniting with my beloved Chang’e.” His voice did not waver as he revealed the truth that guided every step he took. “When you asked what guides my steps, my answer is simple: it is love—steadfast and unwavering—that draws me forward, lighting my path even in the darkest night.”

For a long, breathless moment, the Jade Rabbit studied him in silence, as if weighing his soul against the stars. Then, with a solemn nod, the guardian acknowledged what Hou Yi’s words and deeds had proven. At this silent signal, the Moon Guardians lowered their spears, the hard lines of their faces softening. The path ahead opened, and Hou Yi, heart pounding with renewed determination, stepped forward toward his next challenge.
Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit nods solemnly, and with a wave of his paw, the Guardians lower their spears, clearing the path ahead. The Jade Rabbit’s whiskers twitched as Hou Yi’s words settled into the moonlit stillness. With a solemn nod, the Rabbit acknowledged the truth within them—love that endures even the coldest distance is the surest guide of all. He lifted a delicate paw, and at his silent command, the Guardians lowered their gleaming spears, their armored forms shifting aside to clear the path. In that moment, Hou Yi felt the Rabbit’s ancient gaze linger on him, both mischievous and wise, as if hinting at riddles yet to come.
Ultimately, Hou Yi and Chang'e agree to make the decision as a promise to each other, vowing that wherever one goes, the other's love will follow, and their souls will remember this promise beyond the reach of gods.

Hou Yi clasps Chang'e's hands tightly, his voice trembling with longing and dread. He glances anxiously at the marble arch and the impassive Moon Guardians, the weight of their decree settling over him like a shroud. Tears glint in his eyes as he struggles to speak. Hou Yi pressed Chang'e close, his arms trembling as if he feared she might slip away like mist at dawn. Years had passed since he last held her, and the sensation was so overwhelming, so impossibly tender, that it felt as though he were awakening from a long and bitter winter. For this single instant, he thought, he would gladly suffer a thousand lifetimes of loneliness. Yet now, with the Guardians watching and their impossible choice looming over them, his heart faltered. How could he bear to lose her again, now that fate had finally brought her back into his arms? The knowledge that only one of them might return to the world below gnawed at him, and the words hovered on his lips: he would choose her over himself, always.
Chang'e clings tightly to Hou Yi, her eyes shining with tears as she turns to face the silent, imposing Guardians, searching for any sign of mercy in their gaze. Chang’e clung to Hou Yi as if she could anchor herself in his warmth, her tears glimmering with the desperation of countless lonely nights. She turned, searching the silent faces of the imposing Guardians for any flicker of mercy, her voice trembling with longing and sorrow as she pressed her cheek to Hou Yi’s shoulder. The shimmering marble arch cast shifting light across them, and Chang’e wondered at the cruelty of heaven—how it could grant reunion only to force upon them an impossible choice. If she returned to earth, she feared the depth of his loneliness; if Hou Yi joined her on the moon, she dreaded her own, and the aching emptiness that would stretch endlessly between earth and moon. The ache in her heart lingered, suspended in the charged hush before the Guardians' demand.
Moon GuardiansThe marble arch pulses with cold light as the Guardians' spectral forms loom closer, pressing the lovers together but casting a heavy shadow over their embrace. The marble arch pulsed with a cold, ethereal light, its glow pressing the lovers together even as it cast a heavy, chilling shadow over their embrace. From that darkness, the Moon Guardians emerged—spectral and imposing, their presence impossible to ignore. Their voices rang out in unison, neither cruel nor kind, but as inexorable as the tides: The arch will not hold forever—decide swiftly, mortals, or be sundered for all eternity; the realm of earth cannot bear you both. The weight of their decree settled on Hou Yi and Chang'e, time itself seeming to splinter beneath the Guardians' impartial gaze.
Hou YiChang'e reaches for Hou Yi's hands, her eyes shimmering with tears as the marble arch pulses ominously behind them. Chang’e reached for Hou Yi’s hands, her fingers trembling as tears shimmered in her eyes. Behind them, the marble arch pulsed with an ominous light, its magic threatening to part them at any instant. Hou Yi drew her close, their foreheads nearly touching, and in a low, urgent murmur he breathed, “Let us not rush—for even in this fleeting moment, our love defies the boundaries set by gods and fate itself.” The arch shivered, impatient, as if echoing the coming storm, but Hou Yi held Chang’e, determined to carve out one last heartbeat of defiant tenderness before the Guardians descended.
Chang'e clasps Hou Yi's hands tightly, tears shimmering in her eyes as the marble arch pulses with urgency behind them. Chang’e drew Hou Yi’s hands to her heart, her grip trembling with urgency as the marble arch behind them pulsed and shimmered. Tears welled in her eyes, threatening to spill as she searched his face for solace, her voice barely a whisper, yet weighted with longing. “Yet how can we measure which heart endures separation more bravely,” she murmured, the words spilling out between ragged breaths, “when both beat only for each other?” The Guardians’ footsteps echoed closer, but Chang’e held fast, refusing to let go, the ache of impending parting mirrored in the desperate strength of her embrace.
Hou Yi clasps Chang'e's hands tightly, his voice trembling, as the marble arch flickers and the Guardians' presence looms ever larger, pressing the urgency of their decision. Hou Yi clasped Chang’e’s hands tightly, his knuckles whitening as if sheer force might keep her beside him. The marble arch flickered with otherworldly light, and the looming presence of the Guardians pressed in, sharpening every heartbeat with urgency. His voice trembled, but his resolve did not waver as he drew her closer, searching her eyes. If a sacrifice was demanded, he would bear it. “Let it be mine,” he breathed, his words fierce and unyielding. Her radiance had guided not only the world but his very soul, and he could not fathom letting it be extinguished. Perhaps, he thought, he was strong enough to hold the darkness alone.
Chang'e clings to Hou Yi's hands, her gaze pleading as the marble arch’s glow begins to flicker and the Guardians’ presence intensifies. Chang'e clung desperately to Hou Yi’s hands, her fingers trembling as the marble arch shimmered above them, its glow already beginning to flicker. The cold presence of the Guardians pressed closer, urging haste, but she could not yet let go. Her gaze searched Hou Yi’s face, longing and conflicted. “Your strength has always sheltered me,” she whispered, voice barely audible above the rising hum of the moon’s magic. The thought of his warmth fading from the earth while she remained hidden in icy solitude sent a shiver through her. There had to be another way—some path for them to share this burden, or perhaps even defy the Guardians together. Chang’e’s words hung between them, gentle but fierce, as she tried to imprint this hope into the brief embrace the shimmering arch still allowed.
Moon GuardiansThe marble arch flickers, its light dimming as the Guardians' voices thunder, casting long shadows over Hou Yi and Chang'e as they cling to each other's hands, desperation and resolve trembling in their gazes. The marble arch flickered, its pale light dimming as the Moon Guardians stepped forth, their presence casting long, cold shadows over Hou Yi and Chang'e. The pair clung to each other's hands, desperation and resolve trembling in their gazes, as the air thickened with the Guardians' thunderous voices. Impartial and enigmatic, the Guardians pronounced their decree, their words echoing through the archway: defiance would bring only oblivion—Hou Yi and Chang'e must choose now, or face the certainty of being cast into shadow, never to meet again. The command lingered, heavy and absolute, as the couple braced themselves beneath the spectral gaze of the moon’s stoic sentinels.
Hou Yi takes Chang'e's hands in his, their fingers trembling as the marble arch pulses with waning light, the Guardians' presence looming ever closer. Hou Yi reached for Chang’e’s trembling hands, their fingers interlacing as the marble arch above them pulsed with a fading, uncertain light. All around, the presence of the Guardians pressed closer, heavy and unyielding. Hou Yi’s voice was low but steady, carrying the weight of a vow rather than a plea. If fate was to tear their love asunder, he would not let it be a mere offering to cruel destiny. Instead, he wanted them to choose—side by side—not as a sacrifice, but as a promise. Wherever one of them walked, the other’s love would follow, constant and luminous, just as the moon shadows the night sky. The words lingered between them, a fragile shield against the coming judgment.
Chang'e takes Hou Yi's hands firmly in hers, their foreheads touching, as the marble arch pulses with impatient light from the Guardians' power. Chang’e took Hou Yi’s hands, her slender fingers tightening as if she could hold back time itself. The marble arch behind them shimmered with restless, impatient light, the Guardians’ power surging in silent warning. Leaning in, she pressed her forehead gently to his, drawing in his warmth, the familiar scent of earth and sunlight she already longed for. 

Softly, as though weaving her words into the space between their heartbeats, Chang’e whispered that they should close their eyes together and speak their hearts’ truest wish—not for themselves, but for each other. If fate were to separate them, she wanted their souls to carry this promise, lasting even beyond the reach of gods. The pulse of the arch grew sharper, but for this suspended moment, it was only the two of them, bound by love and longing, committing themselves to memory before the world changed forever.
----------------------------------------

Hand in hand, Hou Yi and Chang’e step into the archway’s silver glow, their promise echoing through the realms, as moonlight weaves their love into legend and the world below stirs beneath the gentle harmony of their sacrifice.
