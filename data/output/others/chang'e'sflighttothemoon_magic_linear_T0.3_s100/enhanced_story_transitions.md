# Chapter 1: Hou Yi Slays the Ten Suns

Hou Yi strides into the village square, bow slung across his back, sweat streaming down his brow as he surveys the devastation.

Driven by his vow to end the people's suffering, he kneels, presses his hand to the cracked earth, and feels the heat radiate through his skin.

As he prepares his arrows, a shimmering portal opens amid swirling golden dust, and the Heavenly Envoy descends, robes fluttering in the searing wind.

The Envoy raises a scroll and proclaims in a clipped, formal tone that the Jade Emperor forbids interference with celestial order.

Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy unfurls a golden-edged scroll, holding it aloft for all to witness, his expression resolute and his posture unwavering. "By decree of the Jade Emperor, let it be known: no mortal nor spirit shall meddle with the order of Heaven. The balance of the celestial realm is sacrosanct, and all interference is henceforth forbidden." ——Heavenly Envoy

Hou Yi clenches his fist, then stands and meets the Envoy's gaze, declaring he will act regardless of the consequences.

Hou Yi rises from his seat, his hand clenched tight, meeting the Envoy’s gaze with unwavering resolve. "You speak of consequences as if they might sway me, Envoy. But I will not stand idle while the suffering of mortals deepens. If my actions incur heaven’s wrath, so be it—I will bear that burden." ——Hou Yi

Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy steps forward, eyes narrowed, the weight of celestial judgment heavy in their voice. "Heaven has cast down greater souls for less, Hou Yi; are you prepared to lose everything you cherish for this defiance?" ——Heavenly Envoy

Hou Yi steps forward, his gaze unwavering as he squares his shoulders, meeting the Envoy's eyes without flinching. "If the price of mercy is all I hold dear, then let heaven strip me bare—for I will not betray those who look to me for hope." ——Hou Yi

The Envoy, bound by duty, returns through the portal, leaving Hou Yi to notch his first arrow and take aim at the burning sky.

His determination is clear: he will protect humanity, even if it means defying the heavens.

----------------------------------------

As the smoke from the fallen suns drifts across the scorched earth, word of Hou Yi’s defiance quickly spreads beyond the mortal realm. The heavens, unsettled by his boldness, begin to stir with whispers of consequence and recompense. In the midst of uncertainty, a new figure emerges from the celestial tapestry—one whose power rivals even the Jade Emperor’s decree. As Hou Yi contemplates the fate he has sealed for himself, the Queen Mother of the West descends from her ethereal palace, bearing an offer that could alter the course of his destiny.

# Chapter 2: The Queen Mother Offers the Elixir

Hou Yi ascends the wide marble steps, his boots scraping against the cool stone as he approaches the Queen Mother of the West, who stands regally beside a low jade table.

She gestures with a slender, jeweled hand, presenting a porcelain vial filled with a shimmering elixir.

Hou Yi bows deeply, his gaze fixed on the elixir, then extends his hands to accept it, fingers trembling with anticipation.

The Queen Mother’s voice rings clear as she warns him, 'This elixir grants immortality—use it with wisdom, for it may divide as well as preserve.

Queen Mother of the WestThe Queen Mother of the West stands tall, her gaze unwavering and regal, as she raises the vial, the shimmering liquid within casting ethereal reflections. Her words hang in the air, commanding respect and contemplation. "Hear me well. The elixir I bestow is no mere gift. Its essence will shield you from the grasp of death, yet its power is double-edged. Immortality can be a blessing, but it may also set you apart from those you hold dear, forging distances no mortal bridge can span. Consider this truth deeply before you accept its embrace." ——Queen Mother of the West

' Hou Yi nods solemnly, clutching the vial to his chest.

A sudden breeze stirs his cloak, and the faint, sweet aroma of the elixir drifts upward.

Determined to protect Chang'e, Hou Yi thanks the Queen Mother, then turns and strides from the pavilion, the vial concealed in his grasp and his purpose set.

Hou Yi bows respectfully to the Queen Mother, his eyes shining with determination. He tightens his grip on the concealed vial, then straightens, ready to depart the pavilion. "Your Majesty, I am deeply grateful for this precious gift. With it, I will ensure Chang'e's safety, no matter the cost." ——Hou Yi

Queen Mother of the WestThe Queen Mother inclines her head, her gaze lingering on Hou Yi as he turns to depart, her words echoing behind him like a subtle warning. "May your heart remain steadfast, Hou Yi—for the vial's power is as perilous as it is precious." ——Queen Mother of the West

----------------------------------------

As Hou Yi and Chang'e leave the celestial palace, the lingering weight of the Queen Mother's warning settles between them, casting a shadow over their journey home. Unbeknownst to them, envy and ambition stir in the heart of Hou Yi's trusted disciple, Feng Meng, whose gaze has already turned covetous. While Hou Yi seeks only to protect what he cherishes most, danger quietly begins to take root among those closest to him, threatening to unravel the fragile peace the couple hopes to preserve.

# Chapter 3: Feng Meng’s Betrayal

Hou Yi kneels near a wooden rack, methodically polishing a quiver of arrows while watching the horizon, his muscles tense.

Feng Meng approaches, carrying a battered practice bow, and immediately confronts Hou Yi about the Queen Mother’s elixir, his voice laced with resentment and frustration at being kept in the dark.

Their exchange is heated and philosophical, with Feng Meng openly challenging Hou Yi’s authority and motivations, arguing that mortals deserve to decide their own fate.

Feng Meng slams the bow down beside Hou Yi, standing over him with narrowed eyes and clenched fists, his voice tight with anger and wounded pride. "Hou Yi, enough with your riddles. Where is the Queen Mother’s elixir? Don’t pretend you don’t know—the whole palace whispers your name. Did you really think you could keep it hidden from me?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi straightens, eyes narrowing as he places a protective hand over his satchel, bracing for Feng Meng’s next move. "Feng Meng, your anger blinds you—what would you do with a power so dangerous?" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng steps closer, fists clenched, eyes burning with accusation. "Spare me your warnings, Hou Yi; I deserve what you hoard—so tell me, or must I tear this truth from you?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi stands, meeting Feng Meng’s glare, his hand hovering defensively near the bow. "You mistake secrecy for greed—I have sworn to protect the elixir, not to claim it." ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng steps closer, voice rising, eyes locked with Hou Yi’s in open challenge. "Protect, or imprison? You think yourself guardian, but I see only a coward clutching what he fears to use." ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi stands firm, his gaze unwavering as he subtly shifts between Feng Meng and the bow, ready for whatever confrontation may come. "If courage means yielding to reckless ambition, then call me coward, but I will not betray what was entrusted to me." ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng steps closer, his eyes narrowed and fists clenched, the tension between them thickening. "Then you leave me no choice, Hou Yi—either you reveal its hiding place, or I’ll find it myself, no matter the cost." ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi, steadfast and honorable, rebuffs Feng Meng’s accusations and warns of the dangers of unchecked ambition.

Hou Yi straightens his posture, his eyes narrowed as he fixes his gaze on Feng Meng, every muscle ready for any sign of threat. "Feng Meng, tread carefully. There are realms and powers not meant for mortal hands, nor hearts. To covet such things invites only ruin." ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng steps forward, eyes narrowing with curiosity and a hint of defiance, watching Hou Yi's guarded posture. "But Hou Yi, who decides what mortals may reach for, if not mortals themselves?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi narrows his eyes, his hand instinctively resting near his bow as he watches Feng Meng's reaction. "It is wisdom, not mere desire, that draws such boundaries—have you considered the cost of crossing them?" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng steps closer, eyes fixed on Hou Yi, his tone both probing and edged with challenge. "Wisdom can be a shackle as much as a shield, Hou Yi; are you so certain that restraint is worth the dreams we must abandon?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi's eyes narrow as he studies Feng Meng, his hand unconsciously drifting closer to the bow at his side. "Dreams unchecked by caution become obsessions that consume all in their path, Feng Meng; I have seen what such hunger leaves behind." ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng's eyes narrow, a subtle challenge flickering in his gaze as he steps closer, searching Hou Yi's face for a crack in his resolve. "Then perhaps it is not hunger, but fear, that truly binds you, Hou Yi—would you deny others the chance to risk what you yourself will not?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi's eyes narrow, his hand instinctively resting near his bow as he steps subtly between Feng Meng and the ancient jar on the altar. "I do not deny the right to choose, Feng Meng, but I will not stand idle if that choice threatens to unleash calamity upon us all." ——Hou Yi

The confrontation grows increasingly personal, as Feng Meng accuses Hou Yi of basking in glory and keeping those loyal to him in the shadows.

Hou Yi, sensing further duplicity, moves to secure the quiver inside the armory.

At this point, Feng Meng’s jealousy and sense of injustice boil over.

Hou Yi storms into the room, grabbing Feng Meng’s arm tightly, his eyes narrowed with suspicion and anger. "Feng Meng! What are you doing here? Why are you sneaking around my house? Speak now—what is it you want?" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng struggles against Hou Yi’s grip, his eyes darting nervously toward the inner chamber. "Hou Yi, I—I'm not sneaking; I came looking for you, but when I saw you weren't here, I panicked—please, let go of my arm!" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi tightens his grip, eyes narrowed, forcing Feng Meng to meet his gaze. "Don't lie to me, Feng Meng—I've seen the fear in your eyes; tell me, what have you done while I was gone?" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng tries to twist out of Hou Yi’s grip, his voice trembling between defiance and desperation. "I haven’t done anything—yet—but you left Chang’e unguarded, and I had to know what secrets you two are hiding from the rest of us." ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi tightens his grip, eyes blazing with suspicion as he steps closer, his stance blocking Feng Meng's escape. "Secrets? Since when did you become so obsessed with what happens under my roof—tell me, Feng Meng, is it jealousy, or something far darker driving you?" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng yanks his arm free, eyes blazing with resentment, stepping back as if ready to fight or flee. "Jealousy? Call it justice—while you bask in glory and hoard the elixir, the rest of us live in your shadow, and I am done waiting for scraps." ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng’s arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps closer, looming over him. "Justice? You dare twist your envy into righteousness while you scheme behind my back—if you’ve laid a hand on Chang’e or the elixir, I swear you’ll answer for it!" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng wrenches his arm free, eyes burning with resentment as he squares his shoulders, defiance etched across his face. "You think me a thief, but what choice have you left me when you clutch immortality for yourself and cast aside those who fought beside you?" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng's arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps between Feng Meng and the door to the inner chambers. "You speak of fighting beside me, but you forget honor—if you truly believed in justice, you would face me openly, not skulk in shadows and threaten what I hold most dear." ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng wrenches his arm free, eyes blazing with resentment as he squares his stance, defiant and unyielding before Hou Yi. "Honor? What has honor ever earned me but scars and empty hands—while you parade as a hero, I am left to beg for what should be shared by all!" ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi releases Feng Meng’s arm with a hard shove, his stance rigid and eyes blazing, daring Feng Meng to make his move. "If you believe you’ve earned a share, Feng Meng, then step into the light and claim it before my eyes, not by creeping like a thief in the night!" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng wrenches his arm free from Hou Yi’s grip, eyes blazing with resentment as he backs away, poised to defend himself if Hou Yi advances. "If you’d only recognized the worth of those who stood by you, Hou Yi, I wouldn’t have to snatch what you guard so jealously—sometimes, the night is the only refuge left for those you leave in the cold." ——Feng Meng

Hou Yi tightens his grip on Feng Meng's arm, his eyes blazing with fury as he steps between Feng Meng and the door to the inner chambers. "Enough riddles, Feng Meng—if you’ve come for the elixir, say it plainly, and face the consequences of your ambition!" ——Hou Yi

Feng Meng wrenches his arm free with a sudden jerk, his eyes blazing as he squares his stance, defiance radiating from every line of his body. "So be it, Hou Yi—I want the elixir, and I will no longer beg for what I deserve." ——Feng Meng

He slips into Hou Yi’s private chamber, searching for the elixir while justifying his actions as a pursuit of justice.

Hou Yi catches Feng Meng rifling through his belongings, and a direct confrontation ensues—Hou Yi accuses Feng Meng of betrayal and warns him against harming Chang’e or stealing the elixir.

Feng Meng, feeling wronged and underappreciated, claims he is forced into this position by Hou Yi’s refusal to share what he believes is rightfully his.

The quarrel escalates until Feng Meng shoves Hou Yi aside and escapes, leaving behind a trail of mud and scattered scrolls.

Hou Yi stands amid the disarray, recognizing the depth of Feng Meng’s envy and the seriousness of his apprentice’s betrayal.

----------------------------------------

As the echoes of betrayal faded, Hou Yi rushed through the ruined chamber, his thoughts racing toward Chang'e and the elixir that now lay at the heart of Feng Meng’s desperate scheme. Unbeknownst to him, Chang'e faced her own moment of decision as the threat drew closer, the fate of the elixir—and her own destiny—hanging in the balance.

# Chapter 4: Chang'e Drinks the Elixir

Chang'e stands at the center table, preparing tea and keeping a watchful eye on the porcelain box containing the elixir.

Feng Meng bursts in, visibly distressed and desperate, demanding the box from Chang'e.

Unlike in the original plot, Feng Meng claims to seek the elixir not solely for personal gain but also out of a distorted belief that its misuse could doom them both—though his true ambition and willingness to use force quickly surface.

The confrontation escalates as both accuse each other of dangerous intentions;

Chang'e subtly shifts the ornate box further out of sight with her foot, her eyes never leaving Feng Meng as she straightens her posture and keeps her tone even, masking the tension in her voice. "Feng Meng, you rarely visit without cause. What brings you here—at this hour?" ——Chang'e

Feng Meng steps closer, his gaze fixed on the now-concealed box, voice low with an edge of warning. "I came for the box you’re hiding, Chang’e; you know there are things inside that belong to me." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e tightens her grip on the edge of the box, her eyes never leaving Feng Meng as she edges closer to the moonlit doorway. "You mistake my keeping for theft—your claim over this box is no clearer than your reason for wanting it now." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng steps closer, his eyes fixed on the box's barely concealed edge, voice low and threatening. "My reason is simple: without that box, neither of us will see another sunrise." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e grips the edge of the box tighter, her eyes narrowed and voice low, poised between defense and demand. "If the stakes are truly life or death, then tell me what you seek inside—and why it threatens us both." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng steps closer, eyes fixed on the box, his voice low and urgent as he tries to gauge Chang'e's resolve. "What you guard so closely is the elixir—if it falls into the wrong hands, it could doom us all." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e tightens her grip on the box, eyes narrowed, shifting subtly to block any path Feng Meng might take toward it. "Then you admit you’d risk everything for power—who are you protecting, Feng Meng, if not yourself?" ——Chang'e

Feng Meng steps forward, eyes narrowed, his hand outstretched as if to seize the box by force if words fail. "I protect the order of heaven itself—give me the box, Chang'e, before your doubt destroys us both." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e keeps her back pressed to the box, her eyes narrowed, watching Feng Meng's every movement for a sign of deception. "If your cause is so righteous, why do you cloak your words in threats and shadows instead of truth?" ——Chang'e

Feng Meng steps forward, gaze fixed on the box, tension tightening his posture as Chang'e's grip on the hidden object tightens in response. "Perhaps because truth, in your hands, is as dangerous as the elixir itself." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e rises, holding the box closer, her gaze never leaving Feng Meng as tension crackles in the air. "Then you leave me no choice but to protect what you fear—and what you covet—from both our hands." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng insists he must have the elixir to protect heavenly order (and himself), while Chang'e stands firm, willing to risk everything to keep the elixir from him.

Feng Meng advances another step, his eyes fixed on the vial in Chang'e's trembling hands, his fingers curling into fists as he tries to mask the tremor in his voice with anger. "Hand it over, Chang'e. Now. You know that elixir belongs to me—I've come too far to let you steal it. Don't make this harder than it has to be." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e clutches the vial tightly behind her back, her eyes darting toward the door as she edges away from him. "The elixir was never yours to claim, Feng Meng, and I won't let your greed doom us both." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng's fists clench at his sides as he takes another forceful step forward, his eyes narrowing with a mixture of desperation and anger. "Don't play innocent, Chang'e—without that elixir, everything I've sacrificed is for nothing, and I won't let you ruin it!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e clutches the vial to her chest, her voice trembling but her gaze unwavering as she edges backward, putting distance between them. "If you truly understood what this elixir could unleash, you'd fear it as much as you crave it." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng lunges forward, eyes locked on the vial in Chang'e's trembling hands. "Fear is for the weak, Chang'e—I won't be denied what I deserve." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e clutches the elixir close, her gaze unwavering as she steps back, placing a trembling hand between them as a final barrier. "Deserve? You seek only power, Feng Meng, but I will not let your ambition destroy us all." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes wild with desperation as he reaches for Chang'e's hand. "Enough stalling—give me the elixir, or I'll take it by force!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e steps back, clutching the vial tightly to her chest, her gaze unwavering despite the fear flickering in her eyes. "You'd threaten violence over what you barely comprehend, but I will protect this elixir with my life if I must." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng clenches his fists and takes another step forward, his eyes burning with impatience and menace. "Don't test me, Chang'e—I won't hesitate to do what it takes to get what should be mine." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e clutches the elixir tight to her chest, her eyes flashing with fierce determination as she steps back, poised to flee or fight. "Then you leave me no choice, Feng Meng—I would rather risk everything than see such power in your hands." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes wild and desperate, reaching for the elixir with trembling hands. "You think I won't cross that line, Chang'e? Watch me—I'd rather see the world burn than walk away empty-handed." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e tightens her grip on the elixir, her gaze unwavering as she takes a defiant step back, placing herself between Feng Meng and the precious vial. "If you force my hand, Feng Meng, I will do what must be done—even if it means you lose everything you ever sought to gain." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng lunges forward, his eyes blazing, hands outstretched toward the elixir clutched in Chang'e's trembling grip. "Give it to me now, Chang'e, or I'll tear it from your grasp—don't mistake my desperation for mercy." ——Feng Meng

Chang'e clutches the elixir tighter, her eyes blazing with defiance as she steps back, placing herself between Feng Meng and the only escape. "You may take it from my hands only if you are prepared to meet the consequences, Feng Meng." ——Chang'e

Feng Meng takes another menacing step forward, his hand reaching for the hilt of his blade, eyes burning with ruthless determination. "You're not the only one willing to risk everything, Chang'e—so choose: surrender the elixir, or watch what your defiance unleashes." ——Feng Meng

Their exchange grows more emotional and intense, with Chang'e showing fear and desperation as Feng Meng threatens and approaches.

Chang'e steps away from Feng Meng, eyes wide with fear. As he lunges toward her, his arm sweeps across the table, knocking over a teacup. Hot tea splashes onto the floor, the sharp smell rising between them, tension thick in the air. "Stay back, Feng Meng! I told you—I won't give you the elixir. Please, don't come any closer!" ——Chang'e

Feng Meng's voice trembles with urgency as he rushes forward, his arm sweeping the table and sending the teacup crashing to the ground, hot tea splattering between them. "You don't understand, Chang'e—I need that elixir!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e stumbles backward, her hand trembling as the teacup tumbles from the table, its contents splattering across the floor between them. "No, Feng Meng—you're scaring me!" ——Chang'e

Feng Meng lunges forward, knocking over a teacup, hot liquid splashing onto the floor. "Give it to me now, Chang'e, or I'll take it by force!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e stumbles backward, clutching the elixir tightly as Feng Meng lunges forward, his arm sweeping across the table and sending a teacup crashing to the floor, hot tea splattering across their feet. "No—please, don't do this!" ——Chang'e

Feng MengHe lunges forward, his arm knocking over a teacup, sending hot liquid splashing onto the floor as Chang'e recoils in fear. "Feng Meng: I warned you, Chang'e—this is your last chance!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e stumbles backward, eyes wide with terror, as Feng Meng lunges forward, his arm sweeping across the table and knocking over a teacup, sending hot liquid splashing onto the floor. "No—I'd rather die than let you have it!" ——Chang'e

Feng MengHe lunges forward, knocking over a teacup; hot liquid splashes onto the floor as Chang'e stumbles back in terror. "Feng Meng: Fine—if you won't give it to me, I'll take it myself!" ——Feng Meng

Chang'e, cornered and realizing that Feng Meng would use any means necessary to take the elixir, ultimately chooses to drink it herself, unleashing its power, as a last resort to keep it from falling into his hands.

The magical transformation begins as in the original plot, with the cottage filling with light and wind, but the dialogue reveals deeper conflict and emotional stakes between the two.

----------------------------------------

As the dazzling radiance faded and the winds settled, Chang'e's form drifted ever higher, leaving behind the turmoil and heartbreak of the world below. The earth grew distant, her home receding into memory, as she surrendered to the pull of the elixir's magic. In that suspended moment between sky and stars, Chang'e found herself drawn inexorably toward a new, unfamiliar destiny—one that would soon reveal itself in the silent, silver expanse above.

# Chapter 5: Chang'e Arrives on the Moon

Jade Rabbit hops to the center of the chamber, dragging a heavy stone pestle.

He pours crushed herbs into the mortar, then gestures for Chang'e to help.

Chang'e rolls up her sleeves and presses her palm to the cool stone, grinding the mixture with steady force.

As they work, Jade Rabbit ponders aloud about the meaning of the moon's tasks and the significance of the keys, questioning whether holding them is a sign of honor or if they bestow special powers.

After sampling a pinch of the powder and nodding approvingly, Jade Rabbit opens a hidden alcove in the wall, revealing a set of shimmering keys, and nudges them toward Chang'e.

'Only those who complete the moon's tasks may hold these,' he says, his words now tinged with thoughtful curiosity.

Jade Rabbit tilts his head thoughtfully, ears twitching with curiosity as he studies the speaker, eager to understand more about the challenge and its rewards. "The moon's tasks. They must be rare and difficult, then. If only a few can complete them, what does it truly mean to 'hold these'? Is it a sign of honor, or does it grant some special power?" ——Jade Rabbit

Chang'e collects the keys, the chamber vibrating with new energy as she prepares for her next challenge.

----------------------------------------

As Chang'e clutches the keys and the chamber trembles with anticipation, far below on the earth, another story is unfolding. Hou Yi, her beloved, senses the shift in fate and refuses to remain idle in the face of her absence. While Chang'e steels herself for the trials ahead on the moon, Hou Yi gazes upward, his heart heavy with longing, determined to seek help from the heavens themselves. Thus, as Chang'e embarks on her lunar quest, the threads of devotion and destiny begin to intertwine, setting the stage for Hou Yi's desperate appeal.

# Chapter 6: Hou Yi Pleads with the Heavens

Hou Yi kneels before the gates of the Celestial Palace, pouring his heart out in a passionate plea to the Heavens, invoking not only his own suffering but the suffering of all mortals as he begs for Chang'e's return.

The Heavenly Envoy, maintaining his formal composure, reminds Hou Yi that such a request can only be answered by the Jade Emperor, and instructs him to rise.

Hou Yi apologizes for his emotional outburst and acknowledges the Envoy's limited authority, demonstrating humility and understanding.

Hou Yi falls to his knees beneath the vast sky, tears gleaming in his eyes, arms outstretched in supplication as his voice echoes with raw, desperate hope. "Heavens above, I, Hou Yi, kneel before your boundless might. My heart aches with every beat for my beloved Chang'e, torn from my side by fate's cruel hand. I have vanquished the suns, saved the mortal realm from ruin, yet my soul knows no peace without her. I beg you, not for glory nor reward, but for love—a love as enduring as the mountains, as deep as the rivers. Have mercy, O august ones! Restore my wife to me. Let compassion move you, for the sake of all mortals who yearn and grieve, as I do now." ——Hou Yi

He then formally presents his bow as a token of respect and a sign of his willingness to accept any trial, not only to the Envoy but also in front of the assembled celestial court.

Heavenly EnvoyThe Envoy closes the scroll with deliberate care, his gaze unwavering as he addresses Hou Yi, voice firm and resolute, allowing no room for negotiation. "Hou Yi, enough. Stand and compose yourself. Your plea is weighty, but the decree of Heaven is not mine to bestow. Only the Jade Emperor himself may grant what you seek. Such is the order of the Celestial Court, and I am bound to uphold it." ——Heavenly Envoy

Hou Yi bows his head deeply, hands clasped in humility, retreating a step to show respect. "Forgive my boldness, Envoy; my desperation outweighs my manners, but I understand the limits of your authority and will await the Jade Emperor's judgment." ——Hou Yi

The gates open, and Hou Yi enters the palace, ready to make his case before the Jade Emperor, with the Envoy and other celestial officials observing to ensure proper protocol is followed.

Hou Yi bows deeply, presenting his bow with both hands, gaze lowered in deference. "Honored assembly, I stand before you not as a hero, but as a humble servant of the people. This bow, once an instrument of valor, I now offer as a symbol of my respect and my willingness to accept any trial you deem fit. My heart is steadfast, and my spirit prepared. Let your judgment guide me, and I shall face whatever challenge lies ahead with unwavering resolve." ——Hou Yi

----------------------------------------

As Hou Yi’s final plea fades into the hush of the assembled gods, his fate hangs uncertain, suspended between humility and the judgment of celestial powers. Far above, the moon’s silver light shimmers—its distant surface home to another soul bound by consequence and longing. While Yi awaits the trial decreed by the Queen Mother, Chang’e herself is poised to confront the hidden guardians of the moon, whose ancient duty tests not only her isolation, but the choices that led her to this exile. As the heavens weigh Hou Yi’s heart, Chang’e must face her own reckoning beneath the watchful gaze of lunar sentinels.

# Chapter 7: Chang'e Faces the Moon Guardians

Chang'e, her silken robes trailing through the moon dust, approaches the towering gate of the inner palace.

She pauses, feeling the cold grit beneath her bare feet, and raises her hand to knock on the crystalline doors.

The Jade Rabbit, alert and twitching his nose, leaps from a nearby boulder and blocks her path, his ears flicking in warning as he says, 'Only those who uphold the moon’s order may pass, Lady Chang’e.

' Without hesitation, Chang’e kneels and presents the moonflower she has cultivated in exile, offering it as proof of her growth and intent to restore balance.

From the mist, two Moon Guardians emerge, their silver armor reflecting the lunar glow.

One Guardian steps forward, extending a staff that hums with celestial energy, and demands Chang’e answer three riddles before the gate will open.

Jade Rabbit circles Chang’e, sniffing the moonflower and watching her reactions.

Chang’e, motivated by her longing to regain agency over her fate and return to Hou Yi, listens, considers, and answers each riddle with careful logic and humility.

Satisfied, the Guardians raise their staffs, parting the palace gates with a resonant clang.

Chang’e, guided by Jade Rabbit’s nod, steps forward into the inner sanctum, having earned the right to seek an audience with the Queen Mother of the West.

The crisp scent of ice and the faint trace of jasmine linger as the doors close behind her.

----------------------------------------

The echo of the gates fading into silence leaves Chang’e alone with her thoughts, the weight of her journey pressing against her heart. Each step she takes into the sanctum draws her closer to the moment she has yearned for—yet she cannot ignore the bargain she made, nor the impossible task that awaits. As the shadows flicker along the ancient walls, anticipation and uncertainty entwine, preparing her for a reunion that will demand more than longing: it will require a choice that could shape the fate of both heaven and earth.

# Chapter 8: The Reunion and the Choice

Hou Yi ascends the marble steps towards the moon gate, where Chang'e waits with the silver key.

The Jade Rabbit and Moon Guardians challenge the couple, requiring proof of Hou Yi's intentions and Chang'e's devotion.

Chang'e offers her own spirit as collateral and swears an oath to uphold the Moon's harmony, deepening her agency and commitment.

Hou Yi answers the Jade Rabbit's riddles, demonstrating wisdom and love as his guiding force.

The Guardians permit Hou Yi to pass, but demand that only one may return to earth.

Chang'e steps forward, kneeling with grace as she presents the shimmering key in her outstretched hands, her gaze unwavering as she addresses the Guardians. "Honored Guardians of the Moon, I come before you bearing the key and a request that weighs heavily on my heart. I humbly ask that you grant passage for Hou Yi, for his journey is of great significance—not only to us, but to the balance of all realms. I assure you, his intentions are pure and his presence here is necessary. I beseech you to consider this plea." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian steps forward, her eyes narrowed with cautious scrutiny as she studies both the key in Chang'e's hand and her unwavering expression. "Guardian Lian: Lady Chang'e, you know our duty is to protect the sanctity of the Moon—how can we be certain that Hou Yi's arrival will not tip the scales or invite peril upon our realm?" ——Moon Guardians

Chang'e bows deeply, her hands clasped tightly around the key, meeting the Guardians' gaze without wavering. "Guardian Lian, I would not risk the Moon’s safety lightly—Hou Yi’s mission seeks to restore what has been fractured, and I vow to answer for his actions should he falter." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansGuardian Wei steps forward, his staff glowing faintly as he regards Chang'e with narrowed eyes, the air thick with anticipation. "Guardian Wei: Words alone cannot guarantee safety, Lady Chang'e; what assurance can you offer that Hou Yi's presence will not awaken forces beyond our control?" ——Moon Guardians

Chang'e bows deeply, presenting the key with both hands as a sign of her unwavering commitment. "Guardian Wei, I offer my own spirit as collateral—if Hou Yi’s presence threatens the Moon, I will surrender myself to your judgment without hesitation." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian’s eyes narrow, her hand tightening around her staff as moonlight flickers in the chamber. "Guardian Lian: Your devotion is clear, Lady Chang'e, yet even the noblest intentions may unleash unforeseen consequences—can you promise us that Hou Yi’s heart remains unshadowed by vengeance or regret?" ——Moon Guardians

Chang'e meets the Guardians' gaze unwaveringly, her grip tightening on the key as moonlight glimmers around her, signaling her unwavering resolve. "Guardian Lian, I have looked into Hou Yi’s heart and found only courage and sorrow—he comes not seeking vengeance, but healing, and I stand ready to guide him should doubt or darkness arise." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansGuardian Wei steps forward, her silver staff glowing faintly as the other Guardians exchange wary glances, the air thick with uncertainty and expectation. "Guardian Wei: Even so, Lady Chang'e, the Moon has endured countless trials—why should we place our trust in a mortal, even one so lauded, when the cost of failure could be the unraveling of all we guard?" ——Moon Guardians

Chang'e meets the Guardians' gaze unwaveringly, her hands clasping the key tightly as moonlight gleams around her, underscoring the gravity of her words. "Because Hou Yi's courage and humility have already saved worlds, and it is only with his strength—and our guidance—that the peril threatening the Moon can be undone." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansGuardian Lian steps forward, her staff glowing softly as the other Guardians gather, awaiting Chang'e's reply. "Guardian Lian: If we grant this passage, Lady Chang'e, you and Hou Yi must swear an oath before the silver gates—to uphold the Moon’s harmony above all else, and to accept the consequences should balance be broken." ——Moon Guardians

Chang'e kneels reverently before the silver gates, offering the key with both hands and meeting the Guardians' gaze with unwavering resolve. "By the light of the Moon and all its guardians, I swear upon my soul and heart that Hou Yi and I shall uphold the Moon’s harmony above all else, and accept whatever judgment you deem fit should balance be broken." ——Chang'e

In the face of this ultimatum, Hou Yi and Chang'e openly express their anguish and longing, debating who should bear the burden of separation.

Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit circles Hou Yi with nimble hops, pausing to sniff at the hem of his cloak. Its whiskers twitch as it peers up, eyes gleaming with mischief and ancient wisdom. "Ah, hero of a thousand arrows, do you know why the moon wears shadows like a veil? Or is it you who brings the darkness with every step? Answer, if your heart is as fearless as your legend claims." ——Jade Rabbit

Hou Yi stands tall, meeting the Jade Rabbit's gaze with steady determination, his hand tightening around his bow as if drawing strength from the memory of Chang'e. "The moon's shadows are not my doing, clever Rabbit—like hope, they linger where light cannot reach, but I seek only the path back to my beloved, no matter how the night tests me." ——Hou Yi

Jade Rabbit tilts its head, circling Hou Yi's feet, its whiskers twitching as if sensing the weight of every answer. "Yet what path is true, archer—one that leads to longing or one that ends in forgetting?" ——Jade Rabbit

Hou Yi clenches his fist, meeting the Jade Rabbit's gaze as the moonlight glimmers on his trembling hand. "Longing keeps my feet moving, even when the ground is lost beneath mist—forgetting would turn me to stone, and I am still flesh, still hope." ——Hou Yi

Jade Rabbit twitches its nose, circling Hou Yi with a sly glimmer in its eyes, paws tracing silent patterns on the moonlit ground. "If hope is your lantern, tell me this: what grows fuller the more you take away?" ——Jade Rabbit

Hou Yi meets the Jade Rabbit's gaze, steady and unblinking, though his hands clench tight around his bow. "A hole grows fuller the more you take away, just as my heart grows heavier with every night I spend without Chang'e." ——Hou Yi

Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit circles closer, its ears flickering with amusement as it carves a winding pattern in the moon dust at Hou Yi's feet. "Hm, quick-witted and heavy-hearted—perhaps you are not so easily emptied, Hou Yi; but tell me, can you name the thing that always runs, yet never leaves its bed?" ——Jade Rabbit

Hou Yi meets the Jade Rabbit's gaze, his voice steady as he steps closer, determination flickering in his eyes despite the ache beneath his words. "A river runs without rest, yet its bed is the only home it knows—like my love, restless but bound to its purpose." ——Hou Yi

Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit's whiskers twitch as it circles closer, eyes gleaming silver in the moonlight, testing Hou Yi's resolve with a sly, challenging grin. "Sharp as frost on autumn grass—one last riddle, archer: what can you break without ever touching, and will you dare its answer?" ——Jade Rabbit

Hou Yi meets the Jade Rabbit’s gaze, voice steady but eyes shadowed by longing, clutching the cloak tighter as if it anchors him to his vow. "A promise can be broken without a hand laid upon it—and I dare not break mine to Chang'e, no matter what your riddles demand." ——Hou Yi

Rather than making a swift choice, they seek a way to share the burden or defy fate together, but the Guardians warn that defiance means oblivion.

Hou Yi bows deeply, his voice steady and sincere. The Jade Rabbit studies him for a silent moment, then nods in solemn approval. At this signal, the Moon Guardians lower their spears, their faces softening, allowing Hou Yi to step forward toward his next challenge. "Great Jade Rabbit, my journey has been long and my heart heavy with longing. I have braved a thousand trials, not for glory, but for the hope of reuniting with my beloved Chang'e. When you asked what guides my steps, my answer is simple: it is love—steadfast and unwavering—that draws me forward, lighting my path even in the darkest night." ——Hou Yi

Jade RabbitThe Jade Rabbit nods solemnly, and with a wave of his paw, the Guardians lower their spears, clearing the path ahead. "Your answer rings true, Hou Yi—love that endures even the coldest distance is the surest guide of all." ——Jade Rabbit

Ultimately, Hou Yi and Chang'e agree to make the decision as a promise to each other, vowing that wherever one goes, the other's love will follow, and their souls will remember this promise beyond the reach of gods.

Hou Yi clasps Chang'e's hands tightly, his voice trembling with longing and dread. He glances anxiously at the marble arch and the impassive Moon Guardians, the weight of their decree settling over him like a shroud. Tears glint in his eyes as he struggles to speak. "Chang'e, after all these years, to hold you again feels like waking from a long, cold dream. I would endure a thousand lifetimes apart for just this moment. But now. faced with the Guardians' choice, my heart trembles. How can I bear to lose you again, now that I have found you? Yet, if only one of us may return to the world beneath, I—" ——Hou Yi

Chang'e clings tightly to Hou Yi, her eyes shining with tears as she turns to face the silent, imposing Guardians, searching for any sign of mercy in their gaze. "Hou Yi, your words are the warmth I have yearned for through endless nights, but how cruel the heavens are, to reunite us only to force such an impossible choice—if I return, I fear your loneliness; if you return, I fear my own, and the ache that will linger between earth and moon." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansThe marble arch pulses with cold light as the Guardians' spectral forms loom closer, pressing the lovers together but casting a heavy shadow over their embrace. "Moon Guardians: The arch will not hold forever—decide swiftly, mortals, or be sundered for all eternity; the realm of earth cannot bear you both." ——Moon Guardians

Hou YiChang'e reaches for Hou Yi's hands, her eyes shimmering with tears as the marble arch pulses ominously behind them. "Chang'e, let us not rush—for even in this fleeting moment, our love defies the boundaries set by gods and fate itself." ——Hou Yi

Chang'e clasps Hou Yi's hands tightly, tears shimmering in her eyes as the marble arch pulses with urgency behind them. "Yet how can we measure which heart endures separation more bravely, when both beat only for each other?" ——Chang'e

Hou Yi clasps Chang'e's hands tightly, his voice trembling, as the marble arch flickers and the Guardians' presence looms ever larger, pressing the urgency of their decision. "Chang'e, if sacrifice must be made, let it be mine—your light has guided the world and my soul alike; perhaps I am strong enough to hold the darkness alone." ——Hou Yi

Chang'e clings to Hou Yi's hands, her gaze pleading as the marble arch’s glow begins to flicker and the Guardians’ presence intensifies. "Hou Yi, your strength has always been my shelter, but I cannot let your warmth fade from the earth while I remain hidden in cold solitude; perhaps there is a way to share this burden, or defy the Guardians together." ——Chang'e

Moon GuardiansThe marble arch flickers, its light dimming as the Guardians' voices thunder, casting long shadows over Hou Yi and Chang'e as they cling to each other's hands, desperation and resolve trembling in their gazes. "Moon Guardians: Defiance brings only oblivion—choose now, or both shall be cast into shadow, never to meet again." ——Moon Guardians

Hou Yi takes Chang'e's hands in his, their fingers trembling as the marble arch pulses with waning light, the Guardians' presence looming ever closer. "Chang'e, if our love is to be torn by fate's decree, then let us choose together—not as sacrifice, but as promise, that wherever one walks, the other's love follows like the moon in the night sky." ——Hou Yi

Chang'e takes Hou Yi's hands firmly in hers, their foreheads touching, as the marble arch pulses with impatient light from the Guardians' power. "Chang'e: Then let us close our eyes, Hou Yi, and speak our hearts' truest wish—not for ourselves, but for each other—so that, even if parted, our souls will remember this promise beyond the reach of gods." ——Chang'e

Hand in hand, Hou Yi and Chang’e step into the archway’s silver glow, their promise echoing through the realms, as moonlight weaves their love into legend and the world below stirs beneath the gentle harmony of their sacrifice.
