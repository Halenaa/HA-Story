        "plot": "The ugly duckling shuffled through the damp grass, webbed feet sinking into the soft mud at the lake's edge. He paused when he saw the swans gliding in the shallows, their feathers gleaming in the pale light. Driven by a longing he could not name, he moved closer, lowering his head and making himself small. The largest swan, standing tall among the flock, lifted its head and fixed him with a calm gaze, then glided forward, sending ripples through the water. The rest of the swans slowed their paddling, watching in silence. The ugly duckling's feathers bristled from the cold and the unfamiliar attention. The swan leader called out with a low, musical note, beckoning him into the water. Shivering, the ugly duckling hesitated, then waded in, water lapping against his sides. The swans parted to make space, their eyes following his every movement. The leader dipped its head in greeting, signaling acceptance. The ugly duckling drifted forward, uncertainty in every step, as the flock closed their circle around him, their wings brushing gently against his own.",

The Brood Mother leans in, tilting her head to inspect the newcomer, her eyes narrowing as she gently nudges the shell away with her beak. Alpha Duckling, already puffed up and dry, circles the Ugly Duckling, flapping his wings and snapping, 'You look odd—stay over there.' One Beta Duckling, following Alpha's lead, scoots closer to the others, their soft bodies huddling away from the newcomer. The Brood Mother turns, ruffling her feathers as she ushers the Beta Ducklings toward the pond, casting only a brief glance back at the Ugly Duckling and muttering, 'Quickly now, keep the line.' The Ugly Duckling stumbles after them, his webbed feet slipping in the wet grass, the smell of the pond sharp in his nostrils. The group moves toward the water, but the Ugly Duckling lags behind, uncertain, as the Brood Mother sets a brisk pace and Alpha Duckling keeps an eye on him, ready to intervene if he gets too close.",

On a splintered crate, the Old Cat lies curled, tail flicking, eyes narrow and unblinking as he surveys the stranger. The Hen, perched beside an overturned bucket, clucks sharply and fluffs her feathers, blocking the duckling’s path. The Ugly Duckling lowers his head and asks, 'May I stay here until the wind settles?' The Old Cat, stretching his claws into the wood, replies with a slow, deliberate yawn, 'Only those who are useful may stay.' The Hen scratches the straw, pecking at a stray grain, and adds, 'You don’t look like you belong. What can you do?' The Ugly Duckling glances at his webbed feet, shifting uncertainly, before offering, 'I can swim.' The Cat arches his back, unimpressed, and flicks his tail toward a puddle near the door. The Hen turns away, dismissing him with a sharp shake of her comb. The Ugly Duckling, sensing their unwillingness, edges quietly to a corner, settling among the straw as the wind howls outside, his presence tolerated but not welcomed.",

He thrusts his chest forward, feathers bristling, and snaps, 'Why do you always lag behind? You're ruining our swim.' Beta Ducklings huddle under the willow's low-hanging branches, their heads ducked and eyes flicking between Alpha Duckling and the Ugly Duckling, unwilling to intervene. Brood Mother glides closer, scanning the scene with tight, anxious movements, then turns her back, nudging the rest of the brood away and murmuring, 'Stay together, away from trouble.' Ugly Duckling shuffles at the water's edge, feeling the cold mud seep between his webbed toes; he looks up at the circling dragonflies and, after Alpha Duckling lunges a second time, flees into the tall reeds, wings flapping awkwardly as he escapes into the mist.

Driven by the need for food and profit, the Farmer throws a battered sack toward the duckling, intending to trap him for the barn. Ugly Duckling, instinctively sensing danger, flaps his wings in a frantic burst, scattering icy crystals and narrowly evading the closing sack, leaving the Farmer muttering and stomping away. The pond surface ripples with Ugly Duckling's panicked escape, his heart pounding against the chill as he dives beneath a low-hanging willow branch for cover.",

Driven by longing, he lowered his head and tried to mimic the geese's calls, hoping to be accepted. The Wild Geese Leader snapped his wings sharply, cutting across the duckling's attempt, and stepped forward, neck arched. He hissed, 'You don’t belong with our flock. Move along.' Several geese shuffled closer, stomping their feet and flaring their wings in warning. One goose snapped its beak inches from the duckling’s face, and another splashed water at him, driving him backward into the reeds. The ugly duckling hesitated, then retreated, his feathers snagging on thorny stems, as the flock regrouped and moved away. The creek echoed with the geese's honking calls fading into the mist, leaving the duckling shivering and alone on the muddy bank.",
