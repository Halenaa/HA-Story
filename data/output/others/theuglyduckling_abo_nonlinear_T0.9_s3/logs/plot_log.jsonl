The largest swan, standing tall among the flock, lifted its head and fixed him with a calm gaze, then glided forward, sending ripples through the water. The rest of the swans slowed their paddling, watching in silence. The ugly duckling's feathers bristled from the cold and the unfamiliar attention. The swan leader called out with a low, musical note, beckoning him into the water. Shivering, the ugly duckling hesitated, then waded in, water lapping against his sides. The swans parted to make space, their eyes following his every movement. The leader dipped its head in greeting, signaling acceptance. The ugly duckling drifted forward, uncertainty in every step, as the flock closed their circle around him, their wings brushing gently against his own."}}
