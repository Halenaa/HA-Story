The Beta Ducklings are uneasy but not actively ostracizing the Ugly Duckling. The Ugly Duckling's struggle for acceptance is more openly verbalized, and the Brood Mother is brisk but not overtly dismissive. The updated plot shifts the group's dynamic from exclusion and strict hierarchy to reluctant tolerance and uneasy inclusion, consistent with the dialogue.",

This change in characterization required updating the plot: instead of outright dismissing the Ugly Duckling, the Hen now experiences her own moment of hesitation and reflection, making her response more nuanced and less immediately rejecting. The updated plot incorporates this more thoughtful, self-questioning behavior while maintaining the natural progression of the scene.",
