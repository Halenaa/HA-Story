He paused when he saw the swans gliding in the shallows, their feathers gleaming in the pale light. Driven by a longing he could not name, he moved closer, lowering his head and making himself small. The largest swan, standing tall among the flock, lifted its head and fixed him with a calm gaze, then glided forward, sending ripples through the water. The rest of the swans slowed their paddling, watching in silence. The ugly duckling's feathers bristled from the cold and the unfamiliar attention. The swan leader called out with a low, musical note, beckoning him into the water. Shivering, the ugly duckling hesitated, then waded in, water lapping against his sides. The swans parted to make space, their eyes following his every movement. The leader dipped its head in greeting, signaling acceptance. The ugly duckling drifted forward, uncertainty in every step, as the flock closed their circle around him, their wings brushing gently against his own.",

Alpha Duckling, while initially puffed up and wary, adopts a slightly conciliatory stance, telling the Beta Ducklings to stick together and keep quiet, rather than actively rejecting the newcomer. The Beta Ducklings remain timid and uneasy, murmuring doubts and hoping the Ugly Duckling will not cause trouble, but they do not fully ostracize him. The Ugly Duckling, confused and longing for acceptance, expresses his desire to fit in and worries about his differences, stumbling as he tries to keep up. Alpha Duckling, instead of outright exclusion, offers reluctant reassurance, suggesting that with time things may become easier. The group moves toward the pond, with the Brood Mother focused on keeping pace and maintaining order, urging the Ugly Duckling to keep up but not fully casting him out. The Ugly Duckling lags behind, struggling to fit in, but is not completely isolated by the flock, as Alpha Duckling now keeps a watchful, if not entirely unfriendly, eye on him, and the Beta Ducklings remain distant but not hostile.",

On a splintered crate, the Old Cat lies curled, tail flicking, eyes narrow and unblinking as he surveys the stranger. The Hen, perched beside an overturned bucket, clucks sharply and fluffs her feathers, blocking the duckling’s path. The Ugly Duckling lowers his head and asks, 'I know I look different, and I don't quite fit in anywhere... but may I stay here until the wind settles? I promise I won't be any trouble.' The Old Cat, stretching his claws into the wood, replies with a slow, deliberate yawn, 'Only those who are useful may stay. The world is wide—and the hearth is warm—but not every paw is meant for this place.' The Hen, at first dismissive, pauses, her feathers ruffling as she seems lost in thought. She mutters, 'You don’t look like you belong here.' Then, unusually introspective, the Hen begins to question her own stance aloud: 'What can I do? The question echoes in my mind, louder each time I hesitate. I feel uncertain—do I really have what it takes to face this challenge? There are choices before me, yet none seem easy. Should I take a risk and try something new, or play it safe and wait for things to change on their own? My heart wants to leap, but my head warns me of consequences. I need to figure out what I'm truly capable of.' She glances at the Ugly Duckling, considering. 'Maybe if I look at the problem from a different angle, I'll find a way forward that doesn't feel so overwhelming. If I break the challenge into smaller steps, maybe I won't feel so powerless and can discover what I'm really able to handle.' The Ugly Duckling, sensing a flicker of hope, says softly, 'Um... I—I can swim, if that's helpful. My feet, they're, um, good for that, I think.' The Hen, still uncertain, does not dismiss him outright, and the Ugly Duckling edges quietly to a corner, settling among the straw as the wind howls outside, his presence tolerated as the barn's inhabitants reflect on the meaning of belonging and usefulness.",

Ugly Duckling, feeling deeply hurt and isolated, pleads, 'P-please, just leave me alone! Why do you always pick on me?' He then mutters to himself about feeling out of place and longing for acceptance, his thoughts running: 'Why do I always feel so out of place, even here by the water? The others never seem to notice me, or if they do, it's only to laugh. Maybe there's nowhere I truly belong... The chill from the mud isn't nearly as sharp as the ache in my heart, wondering if I'll ever find someone who understands me.' Alpha Duckling sneers, 'Keep dreaming, freak—maybe the dragonflies will want you!' The Beta Ducklings huddle silently under the willow's low-hanging branches, unwilling to intervene. Brood Mother glides closer, scanning the scene with anxious movements, then turns her back, nudging the rest of the brood away and murmuring, 'Stay together, away from trouble.'

Driven by the need for food and profit, the Farmer throws a battered sack toward the duckling, intending to trap him for the barn. The Farmer addresses the duckling directly, harshly insisting that he will be caught for food, and the Ugly Duckling, in a state of fear and desperation, pleads for his life, begging the Farmer to let him go and insisting he is searching for his family. The Farmer, unmoved by these pleas, continues to try to catch him, but the Ugly Duckling, propelled by terror and instinct, flaps his wings in a frantic burst, scattering icy crystals and narrowly evading the closing sack. The Farmer mutters angrily and stomps away, vowing not to let the duckling escape next time.

The Wild Geese Leader snapped his wings sharply, cutting across the duckling's attempt, and stepped forward, neck arched. He hissed, 'You don’t belong with our flock. Your scent is wrong, your flight is clumsy, and your eyes carry secrets we don’t share. Turn back before you bring trouble on us all.' Without further delay, the leader barked orders to the flock, 'Keep moving! We don't have time to waste—fall in, everyone. Eyes sharp. Let's go! No stragglers—I want everyone accounted for when we reach the ridge.' Several geese shuffled closer, stomping their feet and flaring their wings in warning, a clear show of exclusion and vigilance. One goose snapped its beak inches from the duckling’s face, and another splashed water at him, driving him backward into the reeds. The ugly duckling hesitated, then retreated, his feathers snagging on thorny stems, as the flock regrouped and moved away in tight formation under their leader's command. The creek echoed with the geese's honking calls fading into the mist, leaving the duckling shivering and alone on the muddy bank.",
