With trembling steps, it moved forward, feeling the water embrace its newly elongated neck and strong, sleek body. Awe suffused every movement, each breath a discovery, each heartbeat a question. The world felt unfamiliar—not hostile, but immense, brimming with possibilities as untested as the wings at its sides.

With a dismissive flick of his beak, he turned away from the newcomer, muttering to Flock's Beta Enforcer, whose sharp tongue whispered warnings to the others.

This time, however, Mother Duck found her voice, openly challenging the cruelty and urging compassion, despite her own conflicted loyalties. The Jealous Duckling, feeling the pressure of the flock’s conformity and his own insecurity, replied defensively, revealing his fear of exclusion and the necessity to protect himself by targeting the outsider. The air turned heavy with tense words and silences, as the Omega Swan, wounded but resilient, questioned whether kindness could ever exist in such a place.

The Winter Fox emerged, its red fur stark against the white snow, eyes bright and hungry. The Omega Swan’s heart hammered as it shrank low, hoping to blend into the ice and shadow. The fox paced at the periphery, circling, testing the frozen surface with careful steps. Fear clawed at the Omega Swan, but it stayed motionless, breath shallow, knowing any movement would betray it.
