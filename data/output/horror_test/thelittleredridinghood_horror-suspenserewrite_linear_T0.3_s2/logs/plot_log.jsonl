She breaks the seal, unfolds the parchment, and scans the cryptic message inside. Red's Mother enters, arms laden with kindling, and sets it down with a thud, glancing warily at the letter. She warns Red not to venture near the woods, recounting the echoing howls she heard the night before. Red, driven by concern and curiosity, copies the letter’s strange markings onto a scrap of cloth, tucks it into her cloak, and steps outside to question the villagers about the symbols, ignoring her mother's protests.
