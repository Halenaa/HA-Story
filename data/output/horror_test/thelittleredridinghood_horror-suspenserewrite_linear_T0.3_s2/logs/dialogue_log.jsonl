Red, troubled but resolute, discusses her concerns and curiosity about the sounds, and reveals the symbols from her grandmother's message to her mother and the villagers.

Several villagers share legends and personal stories about the symbols, revealing their connection to an old forest cult and warning that those marked are sometimes changed or cursed. Despite her mother's heightened protests and the villagers' warnings, Red insists she must learn the truth, seeking out anyone who might help her understand the dangers ahead.
