She breaks the seal, unfolds the parchment, and scans the cryptic message inside. Red's Mother enters, arms laden with kindling, and sets it down with a thud, glancing warily at the letter. She warns Red not to venture near the woods, recounting the echoing howls she heard the night before, and pleads with Red to promise she will stay close to the cottage. Red, troubled but resolute, discusses her concerns and curiosity about the sounds, and reveals the symbols from her grandmother's message to her mother and the villagers. Instead of immediately sneaking away, Red openly questions the villagers about the markings, drawing fearful and superstitious responses. Several villagers share legends and personal stories about the symbols, revealing their connection to an old forest cult and warning that those marked are sometimes changed or cursed. Despite her mother's heightened protests and the villagers' warnings, Red insists she must learn the truth, seeking out anyone who might help her understand the dangers ahead. The scene ends with Red more determined than ever, having gathered new, unsettling information, and resolved to uncover the meaning behind her grandmother's warning—even if it means facing the secrets of the forest herself.",

Her mother stands blocking the narrow path, gripping Red's arm and glancing nervously at the forest. Red pulls her arm free, checks the contents of her satchel—bread, lantern, knife—and pushes past her mother, determined to reach her grandmother. Red's Mother calls after her in a low, urgent voice, warning her not to stray from the path and to return before nightfall, but Red does not look back. This time, however, Red pauses for a brief moment in response to her mother's pleading and reassures her: 'I promise I'll be careful, Mother.' With that, she turns and continues into the woods, the crisp snap of twigs under Red's boots marking her entry into the forbidden woods as her mother's warnings fade into the thickening trees.",

The Wolf proposes a sinister bargain: if Red brings him the Woodsman's silver axe, he will let her grandmother go unharmed. He flicks his ear, waiting for Red's decision.

Red narrows her eyes, refusing to back away. 'My grandmother's missing. I have to find her.' The Woodsman glances at the gnawed marks on the cabin door, then steps closer, lowering his axe.
