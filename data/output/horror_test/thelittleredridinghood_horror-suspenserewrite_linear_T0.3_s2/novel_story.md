# Chapter 1: Red Receives Her Grandmother's Cryptic Letter

Red sits at the rough wooden table, sorting through a bundle of letters when her fingers pause on an envelope sealed with wax and her grandmother's symbol.

She breaks the seal, unfolds the parchment, and scans the cryptic message inside.

Red's Mother enters, arms laden with kindling, and sets it down with a thud, glancing warily at the letter.

She warns Red not to venture near the woods, recounting the echoing howls she heard the night before, and pleads with Red to promise she will stay close to the cottage.

Red's MotherShe pulls Red gently aside, her hands trembling slightly as she brushes a strand of hair behind Red's ear, her voice hushed and urgent. "Red, listen to me—stay away from the woods today. Last night, I heard howls echoing through the trees. It sounded closer than ever before, and I couldn't sleep for worry. Whatever's out there, it's dangerous. Promise me you won't go near." ——Red's Mother

Red twists her fingers in her cloak, eyes darting toward the shadowed tree line beyond the cottage window. "But Mama, what if someone needs help out there—what if they're calling for us?" ——Red

Red's MotherShe kneels beside Red, gripping her hands tightly, her eyes filled with fear and pleading. "Oh, Red, those weren't cries for help—they were warnings, wild and sharp, and no good ever comes from answering them." ——Red's Mother

Red’s mother clutches Red’s hand tightly, her eyes searching her daughter’s face for reassurance. "Please, Red, for my peace of mind, promise me you'll stay within sight of the cottage today." ——Red

Red glances toward the dark line of the trees, her curiosity warring with her mother's fear. "Mama, I'll stay close, but those sounds haunt me—they make me wonder what's truly out there." ——Red

Red's MotherRed's mother pulls Red gently into a protective embrace, her hands trembling ever so slightly as she glances anxiously toward the dark line of trees beyond the cottage window. "Wonder all you wish from the safety of our doorstep, child, but remember—curiosity is no match for the shadows in those woods." ——Red's Mother

Red, troubled but resolute, discusses her concerns and curiosity about the sounds, and reveals the symbols from her grandmother's message to her mother and the villagers.

Red holds out the scrap of cloth, displaying the copied symbols to the gathered villagers, her voice steady despite her mother's anxious calls from the doorway. "Excuse me, everyone—could you take a look at this? I found these strange markings in a letter, and I have to know what they mean. Has anyone seen symbols like these before?" ——Red

VillagersHe shuffles backwards, making a warding gesture, while a hush falls over the gathered villagers. "Old Man Harris squints at the cloth, his voice trembling, 'Those marks. they belonged to the old forest cult, child—best you leave such things be.'" ——Villagers

Red's MotherShe reaches for Red's arm, her grip gentle but urgent, eyes darting nervously to the other villagers. "Red's Mother: Red, please, don't go stirring up trouble—those symbols are nothing but bad luck, and you know how stories about the forest end." ——Red's Mother

Red clutches the cloth tighter, scanning the crowd for any sign of recognition or willingness to speak, her resolve deepening despite her mother's anxious grip on her arm. "But I can't just ignore this—if these symbols are tied to the forest cult, someone has to know what they wanted, or what danger they might bring." ——Red

VillagersShe pulls her shawl tighter and backs away, eyes darting toward the shadowy edge of the woods. "Aunt Marla glances around nervously, whispering, 'Some say the cult marked their chosen with those signs—if you’re showing them, you might draw their attention.'" ——Villagers

Red squares her shoulders, meeting the villagers’ wary eyes, determination burning in her own as she tucks the cloth safely away and begins scanning the crowd for anyone willing to speak further. "If knowing the truth means risking their attention, then so be it—someone in this village remembers more, and I intend to find out who." ——Red

VillagersRed leans in, her eyes bright with determination, as the circle of villagers grows tense, some edging away and others watching her with wary fascination. "Young Tom, voice barely above a whisper, admits, 'My grandfather used to tell tales of the symbols—said they were warnings, meant to keep outsiders from stumbling on secrets buried deep in the woods.'" ——Villagers

Red steps closer to Tom, her eyes earnest and determined, clutching the cloth tightly as the villagers exchange uneasy glances. "Then I need to hear those tales, Tom—please, anything your grandfather told you could help me understand what we’re facing." ——Red

VillagersTom glances around warily as a hush falls over the villagers, a chill settling in the air. "Tom hesitates, then nods, 'He said the symbols meant danger followed those who sought the heart of the forest—that some secrets were guarded by more than just shadows.'" ——Villagers

RedShe holds the cloth higher, her gaze sweeping the wary faces gathered around, determined to break their silence. "Red, undeterred, turns to the rest of the crowd and calls out, 'If anyone else knows anything—anything at all—about these markings or what lies in the heart of the forest, now’s the time to speak up.'" ——Red

VillagersWidow Lark clutches her shawl tighter, voice shaking as she glances warily at the tree line, the other villagers drawing back in uneasy silence. "A hush falls over the villagers as Widow Lark steps forward, her eyes haunted, 'My late husband once bore such a mark after a night lost in the woods—and he was never the same again.'" ——Villagers

Red's hand tightens around the scrap of cloth, her determination unwavering as she waits for the widow's reply. "Red steps closer to Widow Lark, her voice gentle but resolute, 'Please, Widow Lark—can you tell me what changed in him after he returned, or what he saw among those trees?'" ——Red

VillagersThe villagers murmur anxiously, some backing away, while Red stands her ground, determination flickering in her eyes despite her mother's anxious gasp. "Widow Lark shivers, her fingers twisting her shawl, 'He spoke in riddles, claimed the trees whispered and the shadows watched—said the symbols were a warning to turn back, or lose yourself to the forest’s will.'" ——Villagers

RedShe clutches the scrap of cloth tightly and steps toward the woods, her resolve unwavering despite the fearful murmurs behind her. "Red straightens, determination burning in her eyes, 'If the forest wants to keep its secrets, it will have to try harder—because I won't turn back until I know the truth.'" ——Red

Instead of immediately sneaking away, Red openly questions the villagers about the markings, drawing fearful and superstitious responses.

Several villagers share legends and personal stories about the symbols, revealing their connection to an old forest cult and warning that those marked are sometimes changed or cursed.

Despite her mother's heightened protests and the villagers' warnings, Red insists she must learn the truth, seeking out anyone who might help her understand the dangers ahead.

The scene ends with Red more determined than ever, having gathered new, unsettling information, and resolved to uncover the meaning behind her grandmother's warning—even if it means facing the secrets of the forest herself.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: Crossing Into the Forbidden Forest

Red tightens her red cloak around her shoulders and steps toward the shadowed treeline, scanning the fog for any sign of movement.

Her mother stands blocking the narrow path, gripping Red's arm and glancing nervously at the forest.

Red pulls her arm free, checks the contents of her satchel—bread, lantern, knife—and pushes past her mother, determined to reach her grandmother.

Red's Mother calls after her in a low, urgent voice, warning her not to stray from the path and to return before nightfall, but Red does not look back.

Red walks steadily forward, her eyes fixed on the winding path ahead, not looking back at her mother calling from behind. "I hear Mother's voice behind me, soft but edged with worry: 'Red, don't wander off! Stay on the path, and be home before the sun sets!' But my feet keep moving, quick and sure, and I don't turn around. There's something ahead that pulls me on, stronger than her warning." ——Red

Red's MotherMy voice trembles as I call after her, watching her small figure grow distant, heart tight with fear and hope. "Red, please listen—there are dangers in the woods you cannot see, and I need you safe with me before darkness falls!" ——Red's Mother

RedI call back over my shoulder without slowing down, eyes fixed on the winding path ahead. "I promise I'll be careful, Mother!" ——Red

This time, however, Red pauses for a brief moment in response to her mother's pleading and reassures her: 'I promise I'll be careful, Mother.

' With that, she turns and continues into the woods, the crisp snap of twigs under Red's boots marking her entry into the forbidden woods as her mother's warnings fade into the thickening trees.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Wolf's Sinister Bargain

Red unlocks the cabin door and steps inside, scanning the dark corners for any sign of her grandmother.

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from behind a tattered curtain, his fur slick from the rain and eyes glinting with intent.

He circles Red, sniffing the air and brushing his tail against the wooden floor.

Red grips her lantern tighter, demands to know where her grandmother is, and refuses to back down.

Red stands tall, her knuckles white around the lantern handle, eyes fierce and unwavering as she stares into the darkness. "I won't leave until you tell me where my grandmother is. I'm not afraid of you. Now, answer me—where is she?" ——Red

The Wolf proposes a sinister bargain: if Red brings him the Woodsman's silver axe, he will let her grandmother go unharmed.

Red clenches her fists, voice trembling as she tries to mask her fear with defiance. "If I do as you ask, how can I trust you'll keep your word and let her go?" ——Red

The Wolf bares his teeth in a wicked grin, his eyes glinting with cruel anticipation. "Trust is a luxury you can't afford, little Red—bring me the axe by moonrise, or your grandmother will pay the price." ——The Wolf

Red clenches her fists, voice trembling as she tries to stand her ground, eyes darting between the Wolf's cold gaze and the path leading deeper into the woods. "And if I refuse, or if I fail—what then?" ——Red

He flicks his ear, waiting for Red's decision.

Red, suspicious but desperate, agrees to the terms and backs out of the cabin, lantern swinging and boots sinking into the wet earth as she hurries towards the Woodsman's hut.

Red clutches the lantern tighter, her breath coming quick and shallow. She glances over her shoulder at the cabin, eyes narrowed, before turning toward the looming shadows of the Woodsman's hut. Her boots squelch in the mud as she forces herself onward, jaw set, determination flickering behind her wary gaze. "Fine. If that's what it takes. but I swear, if this is another trick—no. No time for doubts. I need answers, whatever the cost." ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Red Finds the Abandoned Cabin

Red grips her woven basket tightly, stepping over a fallen branch as she approaches the creaking cabin.

She scans the perimeter, her boots sinking slightly into the mud, and peers through a cracked window, searching for signs of her grandmother.

Suddenly, the Woodsman emerges from behind a cedar, axe in hand, his boots scraping against gravel.

'You shouldn't be here, girl,' he warns, voice low and urgent.

Red narrows her eyes, refusing to back away.

Red clenches her fists, standing her ground and meeting the challenge head-on. "I won't step aside—not now, not ever. If you think you can scare me into turning back, you're wrong. There's too much at stake for me to run." ——Red

'My grandmother's missing.

I have to find her.

' The Woodsman glances at the gnawed marks on the cabin door, then steps closer, lowering his axe.

The Woodsman runs a rough fingertip over the deep grooves in the wood, eyes narrowed, listening for any movement beyond the tree line. "Those ain’t no squirrel teeth… Something big’s been here, and it’s hungry." ——The Woodsman

The WoodsmanHe runs his rough fingers along the ragged wood, eyes scanning the treeline for movement. "I’ve seen marks like these before, out past the ridge—never this close to home." ——The Woodsman

The WoodsmanHe runs his fingers along the deep grooves, eyes narrowing as he scans the treeline for movement. "If it’s bold enough to come this close, it won’t stop at the wood next time." ——The Woodsman

'Wolf's been near.

Tracks everywhere.

' He gestures at muddy paw prints near the threshold.

The Woodsman stoops low, tracing a finger along one of the paw prints, his brow furrowing with concern as he scans the shadows beyond the threshold. "Well now, those weren't there this morning. Looks like something wandered close to the door—heavy paws, judging by the spread and depth. Not a fox, nor the neighbor's dog, I reckon. Might've been searching for shelter from the rain, or something even hungrier. Best keep the lantern handy tonight, just in case." ——The Woodsman

Red kneels, tracing the claw marks with her finger, then stands.

Red frowns, glancing over her shoulder at the shadowy treeline, her fingers still tingling from the rough grooves. "These aren't from any animal I've seen before. they're too deep, too deliberate." ——Red

Red glances over her shoulder, unease flickering across her face as she scans the shadowy woods. "Whatever did this was hunting—and it knew exactly what it wanted." ——Red

Red glances warily over her shoulder, her hand moving instinctively to the hilt of her knife. "I need to be careful—whatever left these marks could still be close." ——Red

'Help me search inside,' she insists.

The Woodsman nods, pushing the door open with his shoulder.

The Woodsman nods, pushes the door open with his shoulder, and steps quietly inside, eyes scanning the dim light ahead. "Alright then. let's see what waits beyond." ——The Woodsman

Together, they enter the shadowy cabin, the floorboards creaking beneath their weight, determined to uncover any trace of Grandmother's fate.

Red clutches her cloak tighter, eyes darting to the corners where the flickering lantern light can't reach. She glances at the Woodsman, seeking reassurance before carefully stepping further into the dim cabin. "Stay close, Woodsman. Every shadow in here feels alive. I know Grandmother must have left some sign. We have to find her, no matter what." ——Red

The WoodsmanHe scans the dim corners, gripping his axe tightly, stepping protectively beside Red as the wind rattles the windowpanes. "I'm right behind you, Red—my axe ready, heart pounding; whatever waits in this cabin, we’ll face it together." ——The Woodsman

Red gently pushes open a dusty door, her breath catching as the hinges groan and darkness spills into the narrow hallway. "If we listen carefully, maybe we'll hear something—a whisper, a creak, anything that could guide us to her." ——Red

The Woodsman edges forward, scanning the dim corners, his grip tightening on the axe as a cold draft stirs dust across the warped floorboards. "Let’s move slow, Red—every step might reveal a clue or wake whatever’s hiding in these shadows." ——The Woodsman

Red lifts the trembling lantern higher, casting shaky light over faded photographs and a battered rocking chair, her eyes searching every corner for a sign of Grandmother. "My lantern’s barely holding back the darkness, but I won’t let fear stop us—the answer has to be here, somewhere." ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: The Wolf Sets His Trap

Red crouches behind a thicket, scanning the forest for movement, her hand tightening around a basket filled with supplies for Grandmother.

She senses the Wolf is near, catching his scent on the wind, and her urgency grows.

Red insists they take a shortcut through the woods to save time.

The Woodsman, recognizing her determination and the danger, agrees and follows her lead as she navigates the forest with boldness.

Red tightens her grip on the basket, scanning the shadowed trees for any sign of movement. Her breath is shallow, every muscle tensed for flight or fight. "The Wolf's close. I can smell him in the wind—fresh earth, raw hunger. If I don't move now, he'll find me first." ——Red

Together, they move swiftly and quietly, Red pushing them onward, both intent on reaching Grandmother's cabin before the Wolf does.

Red grabs her basket and starts running down the forest path, glancing nervously over her shoulder. "We have to hurry—if he gets to Grandmother first, who knows what he'll do! I can't let anything happen to her. Come on, this way!" ——Red

Red breaks into a run along the winding forest path, glancing anxiously over her shoulder. "We can't waste a single second—every moment we lose puts Grandmother in more danger." ——Red

Red grabs your hand and starts running toward the narrow forest path, glancing anxiously over her shoulder. "If we keep moving and stick to the shortcut through the woods, we might just beat him there!" ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Red Fights Back

Red crouches behind a fallen log, gripping a makeshift sling in her hand while scanning the underbrush for movement.

The Woodsman strides quietly into the clearing, boots crunching on twigs, and signals Red to stay low.

He unsheathes his axe, its metal reflecting the dying light, and whispers, 'The wolf’s trail leads west.

Are you ready?

' Red nods, stuffing a stone into her sling and replying, 'We have to reach Grandmother before it does.

' Together, they advance, Red marking trees with chalk as they move and the Woodsman pausing to listen for rustling in the brush, their coordinated actions driven by the urgency to rescue Grandmother and outsmart the wolf.

Red grips a piece of chalk tightly, her hands trembling just a little as she draws another mark on the rough bark. She glances nervously at the Woodsman, her eyes darting between the shadowy trees and the path ahead. "I'll keep marking the trees so we don't lose our way, and you listen for anything unusual. We have to stay sharp—Grandmother's counting on us, and the wolf could be anywhere." ——Red

The Woodsman crouches low, axe ready, scanning the shadows for any sign of movement while keeping pace with Red. "Every time the wind shifts, I catch a new sound—stay close and keep your eyes open; if we move together, we’ll be harder to ambush." ——The Woodsman

Red crouches beside a tree, swiftly drawing two chalk lines while scanning the shadows for movement. "If we spot any fresh tracks or fur, I'll mark it with a double line so you know it's wolf sign." ——Red

The WoodsmanHe grips his axe tighter, eyes scanning the undergrowth as he nods to Red, silently rehearsing their plan. "If I signal with my axe raised, drop low and stay behind me—I'll draw its attention while you slip past to Grandmother." ——The Woodsman

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Final Confrontation

Red enters the cabin, clutching the iron poker, as Grandmother urgently warns her to stay back, seeking to protect Red and buying time by pleading with The Wolf for mercy.

The Wolf, unmoved by appeals and taunting their fear, reveals his predatory intent but is momentarily distracted by Grandmother's offer to sacrifice herself for Red.

Grandmother clutches the quilt tighter around her trembling shoulders, her eyes wide with terror as she glances from the flickering shadows to The Wolf's gleaming fangs. "Please, stay back—I've nothing here for you but old bones and colder soup. Mercy, I beg you, leave me be!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf edges closer, claws scraping against the hearthstones, his yellow eyes never leaving Grandmother's face. "Mercy is a word for the weak, old woman—what I seek is not your scraps, but the taste of your trembling fear." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches the quilt tighter, her voice quavering as she edges further from the hearth, eyes locked on The Wolf's advancing shadow. "If you have any heart, think of your own mother—she would weep to see you like this." ——Grandmother

The Wolf prowls closer, claws scratching softly against the floorboards, eyes glinting hungrily in the gloom. "My mother taught me to hunt, not to heed the whimpers of prey." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches the quilt tighter to her chest, her eyes darting desperately toward the cottage door, voice quavering as she pleads. "Then take pity, if not on me, on the little one who will soon come through that door—let her find me alive, I beg you." ——Grandmother

The Wolf's eyes gleam hungrily as he shifts closer to the firelight, casting a long, monstrous shadow across Grandmother's bed. "Little ones make for sweeter stories—and sweeter meals; perhaps I shall wait for her after all." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches the quilt to her chest, her voice quavering as she lifts pleading eyes to The Wolf, desperate to shield her granddaughter from the looming danger. "No—take me, but spare her, I implore you!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf slinks closer, eyes gleaming in the firelight, claws scraping softly against the hearthstones as Grandmother shrinks back, clutching the quilt tighter around her shaking frame. "Such bargains are wasted on wolves, old woman—fear tastes richest when shared between kin." ——The Wolf

The Wolf refuses any bargain, emphasizing the thrill of shared fear between kin.

As Red arrives, Grandmother points out The Wolf's aversion to rue and wormwood, throwing herbs into the fire to create acrid smoke that forces The Wolf to retreat.

Red and Grandmother coordinate closely, reaffirming their unity and resolve as they block The Wolf's escape, trading words of courage and warning while The Wolf circles, seeking a weakness.

Grandmother tosses another pinch of herbs into the fire, producing even thicker, acrid smoke. She steps protectively in front of Red, eyes never leaving the snarling Wolf who retreats, hackles raised and eyes gleaming with malevolence. Red clutches her cloak, half-hiding behind Grandmother, her face a mix of fear and awe. "Stay back, Red! This beast cannot stand the scent of rue and wormwood—see how he recoils? He is not invincible, but we must not let our guard down. Even wounded, a wolf is most dangerous when cornered." ——Grandmother

Red clutches her cloak tighter, eyes darting from the curling smoke to the Wolf's glinting fangs, her voice trembling but urgent. "Red: But Grandmother, what if the smoke fades—what do we do then?" ——Red

Grandmother tosses another pinch of herbs onto the flames, the smoke thickening as she positions herself protectively between Red and the snarling Wolf. "We keep the fire alive and our wits sharper still, for knowledge is our shield and his hunger our greatest peril." ——Grandmother

The Wolf circles just beyond the smoky haze, his eyes glinting with both fury and cunning, testing the shifting edge of the smoke as he searches for a weakness. "You may drive me back with your bitter herbs, old woman, but your fire will not burn forever—and when it dies, so does your hope." ——The Wolf

Red vows not to let harm come to Grandmother again, while Grandmother hints at deeper secrets and old magic.

Red steps sideways, eyes fixed on the Wolf, mirroring Grandmother's movements to close off another gap, her stance firm and ready. "Stay close, Grandmother—don't let him through. We have him trapped; he won't slip past us this time." ——Red

Grandmother plants her cane firmly, moving in sync with Red to cut off the Wolf's path, her gaze unwavering as she tracks the creature's every twitch. "Keep your eyes sharp, Red—every move he makes is a trick, but together we can hold the line." ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his fangs, circling low and quick, testing the resolve of Red and Grandmother as he searches for the weakest point in their defense. "You think you can block every path, little ones, but a cornered wolf bites hardest—step aside, or I’ll show you just how sharp my teeth are." ——The Wolf

Red and Grandmother shift in perfect sync, closing the gap between them and forcing the Wolf into an increasingly smaller space. "We’re not afraid of your threats, Wolf; every time you circle, we tighten our guard—there’s nowhere left for you to run." ——Red

The Wolf lowers his stance, muscles coiled, eyes darting for any weakness in their defense as he feints left, testing their resolve. "You underestimate me, Red—I've slipped through tighter nets than this, and your courage won't shield you forever." ——The Wolf

Grandmother shifts her stance, planting herself solidly beside Red, eyes never leaving the Wolf as he prowls the perimeter, searching for weakness. "Stand firm, Red—his bluster is nothing but desperation, and together we'll outlast his cunning." ——Grandmother

The Wolf feints left, then darts right, testing the barricade with a low, menacing snarl. "You claim courage, but I see your hands trembling—how long before your resolve cracks and you leave a gap?" ——The Wolf

Red and Grandmother shift in perfect tandem, blocking the Wolf's attempted feint toward the doorway, forcing the creature to retreat and reassess, hackles raised. "Red: My hands may tremble, but my will does not—and every heartbeat, our net draws closer around you." ——Red

The WolfHe feints toward Red, then pivots sharply, testing their coordination as he searches for an opening. "The Wolf snarls, circling faster, his eyes darting for any sign of weakness—'You may draw closer, but every beast finds a crack to slip through.'" ——The Wolf

RedGrandmother shifts her stance, mirroring Red, both moving in unison to cut off the Wolf's latest attempt to dart past, their eyes locked on his every twitch. "Grandmother: We know these woods better than you, Wolf—every path, every shadow, and we will not falter now." ——Red

The WolfHis muscles coil, ready to spring, but Red and Grandmother shift in perfect tandem, barring each feint with unwavering resolve. "The Wolf growls low, feinting left before lunging right—'Then let us see whose patience breaks first, for I am tireless when hunger drives me.'" ——The Wolf

Red shifts, mirroring the Wolf's lunge, her stance unwavering as Grandmother edges closer, blocking the last open gap. "Red: We match your hunger with our resolve, Wolf, and every move you make only tightens our snare." ——Red

The WolfHe darts toward a narrow gap between Red and Grandmother, testing their coordination as his muscles coil for a sudden burst. "The Wolf bares his teeth, voice edged with both threat and desperation—'Resolve may hold the line, Red, but the wild always finds a way.'" ——The Wolf

Red and Grandmother shift in perfect synchrony, cutting off the Wolf’s latest feint and forcing him into a shrinking circle. "Not this time, Wolf—our unity is stronger than your wildness, and together, we close every gap you chase." ——Red

The Wolf, cornered and growing desperate, threatens them, but the pair stand firm, matching his hunger with their determination and knowledge of the woods.

Red squares her shoulders, knuckles white around the poker, eyes fixed on The Wolf. Her voice shakes, but her stance is unyielding as she steps forward, placing herself between Grandmother and the advancing threat. "I won't let you hurt her again, Wolf. Not this time. Whatever happens, I will protect my family." ——Red

Grandmother crushes the dried leaves with trembling but deliberate fingers, casting a pungent cloud between herself and The Wolf. "Grandmother: The old ways have power yet, Wolf—choose your next move wisely, for my herbs are not all for healing." ——Grandmother

The Wolf lowers his stance, muscles tensed, eyes flicking between Red's raised poker and Grandmother's swirling herbs, as a low growl rumbles in his throat. "The Wolf: Brave words, child—but courage tastes as sweet as fear when the hunt ends, and tonight, I feast." ——The Wolf

The scene closes as all three face off, each poised for a final confrontation, with Red and Grandmother united in defense and The Wolf more menacing, but also increasingly desperate.

# Chapter 8: Escape from the Woods

Red crouches behind a fallen log, scanning the fog for movement while clutching a sturdy branch.

Grandmother limps beside her, clutching a torn shawl and pointing toward a narrow animal trail leading away from their cabin.

Red whispers, 'Stay close, the path's safer by the stream.

' Grandmother nods, pulling Red's sleeve to urge her onward.

They push through brambles, snapping twigs beneath their boots, both intent on escaping the Wolf's territory.

Their goal is to reach the village before the Wolf catches their scent.

As they round a mossy boulder, Grandmother signals for silence and Red freezes, listening to the muted crunch of heavy paws nearby.

They slip deeper into the thick brush, leaving only broken branches and crushed leaves behind.
