She breaks the seal, unfolds the parchment, and scans the cryptic message inside. Red's Mother enters, arms laden with kindling, and sets it down with a thud, glancing warily at the letter. She warns Red not to venture near the woods, recounting the echoing howls she heard the night before. Red, driven by concern and curiosity, copies the letter’s strange markings onto a scrap of cloth, tucks it into her cloak, and steps outside to question the villagers about the symbols, ignoring her mother's protests. The scene ends with Red determined to uncover the meaning behind her grandmother's warning, setting her on the path to the woods.",

Her mother stands blocking the narrow path, gripping Red's arm and glancing nervously at the forest. Red pulls her arm free, checks the contents of her satchel—bread, lantern, knife—and pushes past her mother, determined to reach her grandmother. Red's Mother calls after her in a low, urgent voice, warning her not to stray from the path and to return before nightfall, but Red does not look back. The crisp snap of twigs under Red's boots marks her entry into the forbidden woods, and the muffled warnings of her mother fade into the thickening trees.",

Red grips her lantern tighter, demands to know where her grandmother is, and refuses to back down. The Wolf proposes a sinister bargain: if Red brings him the Woodsman's silver axe, he will let her grandmother go unharmed. He flicks his ear, waiting for Red's decision. Red, suspicious but desperate, agrees to the terms and backs out of the cabin, lantern swinging and boots sinking into the wet earth as she hurries towards the Woodsman's hut.",

Red narrows her eyes, refusing to back away. 'My grandmother's missing. I have to find her.' The Woodsman glances at the gnawed marks on the cabin door, then steps closer, lowering his axe. 'Wolf's been near. Tracks everywhere.' He gestures at muddy paw prints near the threshold. Red kneels, tracing the claw marks with her finger, then stands. 'Help me search inside,' she insists. The Woodsman nods, pushing the door open with his shoulder. Together, they enter the shadowy cabin, the floorboards creaking beneath their weight, determined to uncover any trace of Grandmother's fate.",
