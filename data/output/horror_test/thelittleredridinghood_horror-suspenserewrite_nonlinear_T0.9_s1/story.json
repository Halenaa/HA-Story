Her red cloak snapped in the wind, rain beginning to needle her cheeks. A low growl rolled from the shadows behind a gnarled oak, and The Wolf emerged, hackles raised, his yellow eyes fixed on her. He circled slowly, paws silent on the wet leaves. Red took a step back, pressing herself against the slick bark, then shifted her weight, ready to dart. The Wolf bared his teeth, voice rumbling with false sweetness, 'Lost, little one?' Red's breathing quickened, but she squared her shoulders and replied, 'Stay back. I won't let you near me.' The Wolf flicked his tail, calculating, edging closer to block her escape. Thunder rolled overhead as Red scanned the clearing, searching for a stick or stone, determined to defend herself and reach safety.",

She paused to listen: a branch snapped ahead, followed by the low crunch of paws pressing into the undergrowth. From behind a thicket, a tall figure stepped onto the path—fur bristling, eyes sharp as broken glass. The Wolf, lips curled in a facsimile of a smile, inclined his head and blocked her way. Red gripped her basket tighter, recalling her mother's warning, but kept her voice steady. 'Good morning, sir. I'm going to visit my grandmother at the edge of the woods.' The Wolf’s nose twitched, catching the scent of bread and wildflowers. He flicked his tail and replied, his voice oily with false concern, 'Such a brave girl to walk the woods alone. Is your grandmother expecting you soon?' Red nodded, stepping sideways to keep her distance, determined to move past this stranger and continue her journey. The Wolf, motivated by hunger and cunning, angled his body to keep her talking, pretending interest in her errand while his eyes darted toward the direction of her grandmother’s house. As Red edged forward, the Wolf’s shadow stretched across the path, a silent reminder of the danger lurking beneath his courteous words. The encounter ended with Red forcing a polite farewell and quickening her pace, while the Wolf melted back into the shadows, plotting his next move.",

She noticed a clump of gray fur snagged on a bramble and bent down to inspect it, fingers brushing the coarse strands. As she straightened, the Wolf stepped onto the path ahead, disguised as a weary traveler with a tattered cloak. Red gripped her basket tighter, recalling her mother's warning. The Wolf dipped his head, voice smooth, 'You seem far from home, little one. Where are you headed?' Red answered cautiously, 'Just visiting my grandmother. She lives close by.' The Wolf's nostrils flared, catching the scent of bread and fruit. He smiled, taking a step closer, 'The woods can be dangerous. Would you like company?' Red shook her head, stepping back and glancing at the fur in her hand. She said, 'No, I know the way.' The Wolf's eyes lingered on her, but he merely nodded and melted into the shadows, his presence leaving a chill in the still air. Red quickly tucked the fur into her pocket and hurried on, scanning the path for further signs of trouble.",

Mother moved around her, checking the contents and pushing a folded cloth deeper into the basket, her brow furrowed with concern. She stepped close to Red, placing a firm hand on her shoulder, and spoke in a low voice: 'You must stay on the path. The woods are not safe, Red. Strange things have happened.' Red met her mother's gaze, squaring her shoulders, and replied, 'I’ll be careful, I promise.' Mother leaned over, securing the red cloak around Red’s shoulders, pulling it snugly before handing her the basket. The wind rattled the door, and Mother glanced toward it, eyes narrowing, before she pressed the latch closed. Red adjusted her cloak, feeling its weight, and walked toward the threshold, basket in hand, determined to show she could handle the journey. Mother watched her go, standing guard by the door until Red disappeared down the winding path toward the woods.",

Driven by hunger, he circles the cottage, nose twitching as he catches the scent of old bread and herbal tea wafting from a cracked window. Hearing the clatter of a teacup inside, the Wolf lowers his body and creeps to the door, claws scraping softly on the wooden boards. He raps on the door with a single, deliberate paw, mimicking the pattern of a human knock. Inside, Grandmother, wary after recent rumors of prowling beasts, approaches slowly and calls through the door, 'Who’s there?' The Wolf, voice gravelly but practiced, replies, 'It’s Red, come with food and a scarf for you.' Grandmother, still suspicious, slides the bolt just enough to peer through, but the Wolf shoves the door with his shoulder, forcing his way in. The sudden movement knocks over a basket of mending, scattering spools across the uneven floor. Grandmother, determined to protect herself, grabs a heavy iron candlestick and swings at the Wolf, who dodges and corners her by the hearth. The Wolf’s objective is clear: to overpower Grandmother and take her place, driven by his hunger and cunning. Grandmother’s actions, fueled by the need to survive and warn Red, result in a brief struggle that ends with the Wolf seizing control of the room and Grandmother silenced, leaving the cottage eerily still except for the ticking of the old clock and the rain tapping against the windows.",

She scanned the dim room, noting the heavy quilt pulled up over Grandmother's form in bed and the familiar teapot steaming faintly on the table. The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightgown and cap, slowly lifted his head and beckoned Red closer with a trembling, claw-tipped hand hidden beneath the covers. Red stepped forward, her gaze narrowing as she noticed the gnarled fingernails and the sharpness of the disguised Wolf’s teeth when he spoke, 'Come closer, my dear, so I can see you better.' Driven by suspicion and her need to protect her grandmother, Red set the basket down, purposefully knocking it over to spill its contents as a distraction. She then moved to the window, unlatching it slightly to let in the cool, rain-fresh air, her actions deliberate as she searched the room for any sign of her real grandmother. The Wolf, impatient and hungry, sat up further in bed, voice growing more insistent, 'Why not sit by me, child? It's cold away from the fire.' Red hesitated, her hand brushing the heavy iron poker by the hearth, readying herself for whatever trap lay ahead.",

As the Wolf’s claws scraped across the hallway floorboards, Red snatched up a jar from the shelf and hurled it across the room. The jar shattered against the hearth, echoing through the cottage and drawing the Wolf’s attention. Seizing the moment, Grandmother edged toward the door, opening it just enough for Red to slip through. The icy air outside bit at Red’s cheeks as Grandmother followed, shutting the door softly behind them. Together, they darted along the mud-slick path, weaving between dripping fir trees, their breath clouding in the chill, while behind them, the Wolf’s furious howl split the dusk.",

The Woodsman knocks, his boots thudding against the cracked floor as he enters, scanning the room for threats. He kneels beside Grandmother, examines the bruises on her wrist, and asks Red to describe what happened. Red points to the splintered doorframe where the Wolf had forced entry, recounting the Wolf's deception and her own decision to hide behind the cupboard. The Woodsman listens closely, then moves to secure the windows and sweep away broken glass, his actions purposeful and protective. Grandmother, regaining her composure, thanks him, her gratitude evident as she presses a hand to his arm. Red helps gather spilled herbs and replace the scattered supplies, her hands steady, her movements careful. As dusk deepens outside, the Woodsman promises to patrol the woods more often, Grandmother assures Red of her pride in her bravery, and Red quietly straightens her red cloak, casting one last wary glance toward the forest beyond the window.",
