Her red cloak snapped in the wind, rain beginning to needle her cheeks. A low growl rolled from the shadows behind a gnarled oak, and The Wolf emerged, hackles raised, his yellow eyes fixed on her. He circled slowly, paws silent on the wet leaves. Red took a step back, pressing herself against the slick bark, then shifted her weight, ready to dart. The Wolf bared his teeth, voice rumbling with false sweetness, 'Lost, little one?' Red's breathing quickened, but she squared her shoulders and replied, 'Stay back. I won't let you near me.' The Wolf flicked his tail, calculating, edging closer to block her escape. Thunder rolled overhead as Red scanned the clearing, searching for a stick or stone, determined to defend herself and reach safety.",

She paused to listen: a branch snapped ahead, followed by the low crunch of paws pressing into the undergrowth. From behind a thicket, a tall figure stepped onto the path—fur bristling, eyes sharp as broken glass. The Wolf, lips curled in a facsimile of a smile, inclined his head and blocked her way. Red gripped her basket tighter, recalling her mother's warning, but kept her voice steady. 'Good morning, sir. I'm going to visit my grandmother at the edge of the woods.' The Wolf’s nose twitched, catching the scent of bread and wildflowers. He flicked his tail and replied, his voice oily with false concern, 'Such a brave girl to walk the woods alone. Is your grandmother expecting you soon?' Red nodded, stepping sideways to keep her distance, determined to move past this stranger and continue her journey. The Wolf, motivated by hunger and cunning, angled his body to keep her talking, pretending interest in her errand while his eyes darted toward the direction of her grandmother’s house. As Red edged forward, the Wolf’s shadow stretched across the path, a silent reminder of the danger lurking beneath his courteous words. The encounter ended with Red forcing a polite farewell and quickening her pace, while the Wolf melted back into the shadows, plotting his next move.",

The Wolf's nostrils flared, catching the scent of bread and fruit. He smiled, taking a step closer, 'The woods can be dangerous. Would you like company?'

He raps on the door with a single, deliberate paw, mimicking the pattern of a human knock. Inside, Grandmother, wary after recent rumors of prowling beasts, approaches slowly and calls through the door, 'Who’s there?' The Wolf, voice gravelly but practiced, replies, 'It’s Red, come with food and a scarf for you.' Grandmother, still suspicious, slides the bolt just enough to peer through, but the Wolf shoves the door with his shoulder, forcing his way in. The sudden movement knocks over a basket of mending, scattering spools across the uneven floor. Grandmother, determined to protect herself, grabs a heavy iron candlestick and swings at the Wolf, who dodges and corners her by the hearth. The Wolf’s objective is clear: to overpower Grandmother and take her place, driven by his hunger and cunning. Grandmother’s actions, fueled by the need to survive and warn Red, result in a brief struggle that ends with the Wolf seizing control of the room and Grandmother silenced, leaving the cottage eerily still except for the ticking of the old clock and the rain tapping against the windows.",

Red stepped forward, her gaze narrowing as she noticed the gnarled fingernails and the sharpness of the disguised Wolf’s teeth when he spoke, 'Come closer, my dear, so I can see you better.'
