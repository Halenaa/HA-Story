Red is slightly more trusting and shares more information than in the original plot, but her motivation and stance remain consistent—she is polite, cautious, determined to continue her journey, and aware of the Wolf's threat. The Wolf's manipulation aligns with his cunning nature. The plot is updated to reflect the more detailed and open exchange, but the overall character logic and narrative progression are unchanged.",
