# Chapter 6: A Desperate Fight for Survival

Red tightened her grip on the wicker basket, eyes darting as she stepped over twisted roots littering the muddy path.

Her red cloak snapped in the wind, rain beginning to needle her cheeks.

A low growl rolled from the shadows behind a gnarled oak, and The Wolf emerged, hackles raised, his yellow eyes fixed on her.

He circled slowly, paws silent on the wet leaves.

Red took a step back, pressing herself against the slick bark, then shifted her weight, ready to dart.

The Wolf bared his teeth, voice rumbling with false sweetness, 'Lost, little one?

' Red's breathing quickened, but she squared her shoulders and replied, 'Stay back.

I won't let you near me.

' The Wolf flicked his tail, calculating, edging closer to block her escape.

Thunder rolled overhead as Red scanned the clearing, searching for a stick or stone, determined to defend herself and reach safety.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: A Sinister Encounter on the Path

Red adjusted the strap of her wicker basket, careful not to bruise the bread and cakes inside as she navigated a tangle of roots.

She paused to listen: a branch snapped ahead, followed by the low crunch of paws pressing into the undergrowth.

From behind a thicket, a tall figure stepped onto the path—fur bristling, eyes sharp as broken glass.

The Wolf, lips curled in a facsimile of a smile, inclined his head and blocked her way.

Red gripped her basket tighter, recalling her mother's warning, but kept her voice steady.

'Oh, thank you, sir!

I'm just bringing some cakes and honey to my dear grandmother—she lives in the cottage at the very end of this path, just past the big oak tree.

' The Wolf’s nose twitched, catching the scent of bread and wildflowers.

He flicked his tail and replied, his voice oily with false concern, 'How thoughtful you are—surely your grandmother will be delighted;

tell me, does she live alone in that cozy cottage, or does someone stay with her?

' Red answered, 'She lives all by herself, sir—she’s been feeling poorly, so Mama asked me to visit and bring her these treats.

' The Wolf, motivated by hunger and cunning, angled his body to keep her talking, pretending interest in her errand while his eyes darted toward the direction of her grandmother’s house.

The Wolf leans in with a warm, toothy smile, his ears pricked for any hint of direction. He tilts his head, feigning concern while his eyes flicker down the path, tracing where Red might go next. "My, what a lovely basket you carry, child. It looks quite heavy for someone so small. Are you traveling far, or is your grandmother’s house nearby in these woods? I do hope she’s well—what brings you out here all alone this fine morning?" ——The Wolf

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hugs her basket closer, her eyes shining with innocent pride as she gestures vaguely down the winding trail. "Oh, thank you, sir! I'm just bringing some cakes and honey to my dear grandmother—she lives in the cottage at the very end of this path, just past the big oak tree." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tilts his head in feigned curiosity, his gaze lingering toward the distant bend in the path as he subtly inches closer to Red. "How thoughtful you are—surely your grandmother will be delighted; tell me, does she live alone in that cozy cottage, or does someone stay with her?" ——The Wolf

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hugs her basket tighter, glancing down the path with innocent concern, while the Wolf’s ears perk up, a sly grin flickering across his face. "She lives all by herself, sir—she’s been feeling poorly, so Mama asked me to visit and bring her these treats." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in slightly, voice soft and inviting, while his tail flicks with anticipation, eyes narrowing as he glances slyly down the sun-dappled trail. "Ah, how fortunate your grandmother is to have such a caring granddaughter; may I ask, do you always take this same path or do you sometimes choose another way through the woods?" ——The Wolf

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red smiles brightly, swinging her basket as she glances down the familiar trail, unaware of the Wolf's intense, calculating gaze. "Oh, I always take this path—I know it so well, and Mama says it's the quickest way to Grandmother's cottage." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

He asked, 'May I ask, do you always take this same path or do you sometimes choose another way through the woods?

' Red replied, 'Oh, I always take this path—I know it so well, and Mama says it's the quickest way to Grandmother's cottage.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red forces a small, tight smile, clutching her basket closer to her chest. She takes a careful step backward, glancing nervously at the darkening path ahead before turning to quicken her steps, her heart thudding. "Well, it was. nice seeing you, Mr. Wolf. I really must hurry along now—Grandmother's expecting me and I wouldn't want to keep her waiting." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf's eyes linger a moment longer, his smile sharpening as he melts into the shadows, watching Red's hurried steps. "Of course, dear Red—do give your grandmother my regards; the woods can be so lonely, after all." ——The Wolf

' As Red edged forward, the Wolf’s shadow stretched across the path, a silent reminder of the danger lurking beneath his courteous words.

Red forced a polite farewell, 'Well, it was. nice seeing you, Mr.

Wolf.

I really must hurry along now—Grandmother's expecting me and I wouldn't want to keep her waiting.

' The Wolf melted back into the shadows, offering, 'Of course, dear Red—do give your grandmother my regards;

the woods can be so lonely, after all.

' He watched her disappear, already plotting his next move armed with details about her route and her grandmother's solitude.

# Chapter 4: Red Discovers Signs of Trouble

Red paused beside a toppled birch, adjusting the basket on her arm and scanning the undergrowth.

She noticed a clump of gray fur snagged on a bramble and bent down to inspect it, fingers brushing the coarse strands.

As she straightened, the Wolf stepped onto the path ahead, disguised as a weary traveler with a tattered cloak.

Red gripped her basket tighter, recalling her mother's warning.

The Wolf dipped his head, voice smooth, 'You seem far from home, little one.

Where are you headed?

' Red answered cautiously, 'Just visiting my grandmother.

She lives close by.

' The Wolf's nostrils flared, catching the scent of bread and fruit.

He smiled, taking a step closer, 'The woods can be dangerous.

Would you like company?

' Red shook her head, stepping back and glancing at the fur in her hand.

She said, 'No, I know the way.

' The Wolf's eyes lingered on her, but he merely nodded and melted into the shadows, his presence leaving a chill in the still air.

Red quickly tucked the fur into her pocket and hurried on, scanning the path for further signs of trouble.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning

Red stood at the table, tying the coarse string around a basket filled with bread and small jars of preserves, her fingers working quickly.

Mother moved around her, checking the contents and pushing a folded cloth deeper into the basket, her brow furrowed with concern.

She stepped close to Red, placing a firm hand on her shoulder, and spoke in a low voice: 'You must stay on the path.

The woods are not safe, Red.

Strange things have happened.

' Red met her mother's gaze, squaring her shoulders, and replied, 'I’ll be careful, I promise.

' Mother leaned over, securing the red cloak around Red’s shoulders, pulling it snugly before handing her the basket.

The wind rattled the door, and Mother glanced toward it, eyes narrowing, before she pressed the latch closed.

Red adjusted her cloak, feeling its weight, and walked toward the threshold, basket in hand, determined to show she could handle the journey.

Mother watched her go, standing guard by the door until Red disappeared down the winding path toward the woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House

The Wolf, fur slick with rain, pads silently through the thick underbrush, his paws pressing damp leaves into the mud.

Driven by hunger, he circles the cottage, nose twitching as he catches the scent of old bread and herbal tea wafting from a cracked window.

Hearing the clatter of a teacup inside, the Wolf lowers his body and creeps to the door, claws scraping softly on the wooden boards.

He raps on the door with a single, deliberate paw, mimicking the pattern of a human knock.

Inside, Grandmother, wary after recent rumors of prowling beasts, approaches slowly and calls through the door, 'Who’s there?

' The Wolf, voice gravelly but practiced, replies, 'It’s Red, come with food and a scarf for you.

' Grandmother, still suspicious, slides the bolt just enough to peer through, but the Wolf shoves the door with his shoulder, forcing his way in.

The sudden movement knocks over a basket of mending, scattering spools across the uneven floor.

Grandmother, determined to protect herself, grabs a heavy iron candlestick and swings at the Wolf, who dodges and corners her by the hearth.

The Wolf’s objective is clear: to overpower Grandmother and take her place, driven by his hunger and cunning.

Grandmother’s actions, fueled by the need to survive and warn Red, result in a brief struggle that ends with the Wolf seizing control of the room and Grandmother silenced, leaving the cottage eerily still except for the ticking of the old clock and the rain tapping against the windows.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: The Wolf Springs His Trap

As Red prepares to enter the cottage, the Wolf is not yet inside, but instead lingers outside in the cold shadows, observing the warm light from within.

The Wolf, shivering and driven by hunger and discomfort, debates whether to risk entering the inviting warmth of the cottage, knowing that stepping into the light could expose him.

He reflects on the ache in his bones and his longing for the fire, which momentarily distracts him from his predatory purpose.

Meanwhile, inside, Grandmother remains hidden or bound, and Red approaches the door, basket in hand, ready to confront whatever danger awaits her grandmother.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: Escape and Confrontation

Red crouched behind the heavy oak table, her knees pressed into the splintered wood, eyes darting to the battered iron poker clutched in Grandmother’s trembling hands.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red whispers urgently, her voice shaking as she glances between the doorway and Grandmother's pale face, gripping the edge of the table so tightly her knuckles blanch. "Grandmother, he's still out there—I heard him scraping against the door. What if he gets in? What do we do?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother tightens her grip on the poker, forcing a shaky smile for Red even as her own eyes flick anxiously to the shadow flickering beneath the doorframe. "Stay quiet, my darling—if he comes through, I'll do what I must, but you keep low and don't let him see you, no matter what happens." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on the table leg, her voice barely above a whisper as she leans closer to her grandmother, eyes wide with terror. "But what if he smells us, Grandmother? I can hear him breathing—so close, like he's just waiting for us to slip." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother shifts her grip on the poker, her knuckles white, eyes fixed on the shadow flickering beneath the door. "Hush now, Red—hold your breath if you must, and trust me; I've outwitted worse than wolves before." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grips the edge of the table, her knuckles white, as a low growl rumbles from the other side of the door. "But this one’s smart—I saw his eyes through the crack, and he’s not leaving until he gets what he wants." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother tightens her grip on the iron poker, her knuckles white, and shifts closer to Red, shielding her with a trembling arm as the sound of claws rakes against the door. "Then we must be smarter still, child—he’ll find no easy prey here tonight." ——Grandmother

Grandmother pressed a finger to her lips, then pointed toward the cracked back door, its hinges groaning faintly with every gust.

Grandmother tightens her grip on Red's sleeve, her eyes wide and darting toward the trembling door, as she edges them both back into the shadowy corner of the kitchen. "Hush now, Red. Not a sound—there's something out there. Stay close to me and don't even breathe too loud." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket tighter, eyes wide, inching closer to Grandmother while casting a fearful glance toward the creaking door. "Grandmother, is it the wolf—you saw him, didn't you?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother draws Red closer, her eyes darting to the trembling door as another gust rattles the latch. "I glimpsed a shadow slipping past the window, too tall and too quiet for comfort." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes darting nervously between Grandmother and the trembling door. "What if it comes in—should we hide, or run?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother gently takes Red's hand, her eyes wide with fear as she leads her towards the narrow cellar door, careful not to let the floorboards creak. "We mustn't run—if we move too quickly, it might hear us, so crouch low and follow me to the cellar, silent as a whisper." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red clutches Grandmother's sleeve, her eyes wide, as they inch toward the cellar door, each footstep measured and slow. "Okay, Grandmother—I'm right behind you, and I won't make a sound." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

As the Wolf’s claws scraped across the hallway floorboards, Red snatched up a jar from the shelf and hurled it across the room.

The jar shattered against the hearth, echoing through the cottage and drawing the Wolf’s attention.

Instead of escaping outside, Grandmother quietly led Red toward the cellar door, urging her to move silently, as the Wolf prowled just beyond.

Together, they slipped into the dark cellar, closing the door softly behind them, breath held in the chill air, while above them, the Wolf’s furious howl split the dusk.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Rescue and Aftermath

Red untangles herself from a toppled chair and rushes to Grandmother, who sits propped against the wall, clutching a shawl.

Grandmother urgently instructs Red to check and lock the door, clearly rattled by strange noises outside.

Grandmother's trembling hand reaches toward Red, her knuckles pale against the quilt, eyes wide and fixed on the shadow flickering beneath the threshold. "Red, dear, please—check the door, quickly. I heard something. strange. Lock it, if you can." ——Grandmother

RedShe glances nervously back at Grandmother, then reaches out with a shaking hand to test the lock. "Red hesitates, her heart pounding, then nods, clutching her basket tighter as she creeps toward the creaking door." ——Red

RedShe pauses just short of the door, her hand hovering over the latch, uncertain whether to open it or turn the key. "Red glances back at Grandmother, her voice barely above a whisper, 'What did you hear, Grandmother?'" ——Red

Grandmother's hand shakes more violently now, her eyes wide with fear as she urges Red on. "It was a low growl, child—like nothing I've ever heard before—please, Red, hurry." ——Grandmother

RedShe pauses for a heartbeat, listening intently for any further sound before steeling herself to peek through the crack. "Red swallows hard, her fingers trembling as she reaches for the latch, eyes wide and searching the shadows beyond the door." ——Red

RedHer breath catches, and every muscle in her body tenses, poised to slam the door shut at the first sign of danger. "Red steels herself, whispering, 'Stay back, Grandmother,' as she slowly eases the door open just a crack, peering into the darkness beyond." ——Red

Grandmother clutches the blanket to her chest, her breath shallow, eyes locked on Red with terrified anticipation. "Be careful, Red—don't let it see you first." ——Grandmother

RedShe keeps her body pressed close to the wall, ready to slam the door shut at the slightest movement. "Red holds her breath, the cold night air slipping through the crack as she whispers, 'I don't see anything—yet.'" ——Red

Grandmother grips the edge of her quilt, her knuckles white, eyes darting anxiously between Red and the shadowy doorway. "Keep the door shut tight, child—whatever it is, we mustn't invite it in." ——Grandmother

Red anxiously asks about the sound, and Grandmother describes a low growl, urging caution.

Red carefully approaches and inspects the door, trying not to be seen, while Grandmother warns her to keep the door shut.

The Woodsman arrives shortly after, finds Grandmother bruised, and questions Red about what happened.

Woodsman kneels beside Grandmother, gently but urgently inspecting her wrist, his brow furrowed with worry. He glances up at Red, voice trembling with concern. "Red, these bruises—how did this happen to Grandmother? Tell me everything you saw, and quickly." ——Woodsman

Red clutches her cloak tightly, her voice trembling as she glances anxiously at Grandmother. "I—I found her like this, Woodsman, just after I came in; the door was open, and I heard her whisper for help." ——Red

Woodsman gently holds Grandmother's hand, his eyes darting anxiously between Red and the doorway. "Was anyone else here, Red—did you see or hear anything unusual before you came inside?" ——Woodsman

Red glances nervously at the shuttered window, clutching her basket tighter. "I heard footsteps running away through the back garden, and Grandmother kept saying 'the wolf,' over and over." ——Red

Woodsman leans closer to Grandmother, his voice trembling with urgency, while Red clutches Grandmother's hand, eyes wide with fear. "Grandmother, can you hear me—did the wolf hurt you, or did you see who it was?" ——Woodsman

Grandmother clutches Woodsman's hand, her fingers shaking, while Red kneels closer, eyes wide with fear and worry. "Grandmother (voice trembling): It was the wolf, dear—he grabbed my wrists and tried to silence me, but I fought him off as best I could." ——Grandmother

Woodsman rises, checking windows and listening intently for any sign of danger outside. "Woodsman (voice firm, scanning the room): We must secure the house—Red, lock the doors, and Grandmother, stay close to me; the wolf may not be far." ——Woodsman

Red reveals she found Grandmother injured, heard running footsteps in the garden, and Grandmother was repeating 'the wolf.

Red gestures shakily at the jagged wood, her hands trembling. Her eyes flicker back to the Wolf, searching his face for any hint of remorse or recognition, her body tense and ready to flee if he moves too suddenly. "Do you see what you did to the doorframe? Splinters everywhere—like the bones you’d snap without a second thought. I heard you before I saw you, your voice all syrupy sweet, pretending to be someone you’re not. My heart was pounding so loud I thought you’d hear it. I knew something was wrong—Grandmother never sounded like that. So I hid, pressed tight behind the cupboard, barely daring to breathe. I had to. If I hadn’t, I wouldn’t be standing here now." ——Red

Wolf steps closer, eyes glinting with predatory amusement, nostrils flaring as if scenting Red's lingering fear. "Clever little mouse, but even the cleverest prey trembles when the wolf is hungry—did you really think a cupboard could keep you safe from me?" ——Wolf

Red glances nervously at the ruined doorframe, clutching her cloak tighter around her shoulders as her eyes flicker between the Wolf’s teeth and the exit. "Maybe not, but behind that cupboard I held onto hope—enough to keep quiet while you prowled and sniffed, turning every shadow into a threat." ——Red

WolfThe Wolf circles closer, his gaze locked on Red, a slow, deliberate grin spreading across his muzzle as he inhales deeply, savoring the memory. "Hope is a feeble shield, Red, especially when your scent fills every corner—I could almost taste your fear, thick and sweet in the air." ——Wolf

Red's hands clench at her sides as she glances at the doorframe, then back at the Wolf, her voice trembling but defiant. "Maybe my fear was sweet to you, but behind that cupboard it felt like poison—paralyzing, yes, but sharp enough to remind me my life was my own to protect." ——Red

' The Woodsman asks Grandmother to confirm, and she reveals the wolf attacked her but she resisted.

The Woodsman, taking charge, directs Red to secure the house and vows to keep watch over the cottage.

Grandmother gently presses her trembling hand to the Woodsman's arm, her eyes soft with gratitude and a shaky smile forming on her lips. "Oh, thank you, dear. I don't know what I would've done without you—my heart was pounding out of my chest. You're a blessing." ——Grandmother

WoodsmanHe gives her arm a gentle, reassuring squeeze, offering a warm smile. "I'm just glad I was here to help, ma'am—you're safe now." ——Woodsman

Red then recounts to all present, including the Wolf (who appears in a tense confrontation), her fearful hiding behind the cupboard and how she recognized the Wolf's deception.

The Wolf taunts Red for her fear, but Red stands her ground, expressing her hope and determination to survive.

WoodsmanThe Woodsman stands by the door, gripping his axe handle with quiet resolve, casting a protective glance toward Red and Grandmother. "I'll make it my duty to walk these woods at sundown from now on. No harm will come near this cottage again, not while I keep watch." ——Woodsman

Grandmother gently squeezes Red's hand, her eyes warm with love and relief. "Oh, my dear Red, you were so brave today—I am so proud of you, and I promise you are safe here with us." ——Grandmother

Red pulls her cloak a little tighter around her shoulders, her eyes lingering on the darkening line of trees beyond the window. "Thank you, both of you—I just hope the shadows stay outside, where they belong." ——Red

Grandmother expresses deep gratitude for Red's bravery, and the Woodsman reassures them of his protection.

As dusk falls, Grandmother comforts Red, proud of her actions, and Red quietly hopes the threat remains outside.
