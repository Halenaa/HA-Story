The mother presses a folded letter into Red's palm, her voice low and urgent: 'Grandmother is worse. Take this medicine, but stay on the main path.' Red nods, adjusting the basket's weight and tightening her grip on the letter. She listens to the distant caw of crows and the soft rustle of wind in the trees as her mother inspects the basket, ensuring the jars of broth and cloth-wrapped bread are secure. Red promises not to stray, then steps onto the path, boots crunching over damp gravel as the forest looms ahead. Red's mother watches from the threshold, her hand lingering on the door, eyes tracking Red until the mist swallows her form.",

Her mother steps forward, placing a firm hand on Red’s arm, and points to a narrow path winding between the gnarled trunks. 'Stay on the trail, Red. Don’t stray, no matter what you hear,' she warns, her voice low and urgent. Red nods, determined, and steps onto the leaf-carpeted path. Behind her, her mother watches until Red disappears among the trees, then turns back to the cottage, gathering firewood as she listens for any unusual sounds from the forest. The objective is for Red to begin her journey and for her mother to ensure she follows instructions. The result is Red’s entry into the woods and her mother’s vigilant retreat to the home.",

Suddenly, the Wolf pads from behind a thicket, his fur bristling and eyes fixed on her basket. He circles Red, sniffing the air and flicking his tail, then blocks her path with a low growl. Red grips her basket tighter and lifts her chin. The Wolf tilts his head and speaks, his voice gravelly: 'Where are you going, little one, wandering so far from home?' Red replies, steady and clear, 'To my grandmother's cottage, to bring her food and medicine.' The Wolf narrows his eyes, pacing closer, and asks, 'Which path will you take, the sunny lane or the shadowed trail?' Red hesitates, then points to the sunlit track, keeping her gaze locked on the Wolf. The Wolf nods, feigning innocence, before darting into the shadows, paws silent on the damp leaves. Red watches him vanish, then quickens her pace, determined to reach her grandmother before the Wolf can. The encounter leaves the forest quiet again, except for the beating of her heart and the rustle of leaves overhead.",

Grandmother pauses mid-sweep, peers through the window, and hesitantly unlocks the door. As the Wolf lunges, Grandmother grabs a nearby iron poker and swings, but the Wolf knocks it aside, forcing his way into the cottage. The Wolf's objective is to deceive and overpower Grandmother to set a trap for Red; Grandmother's objective is to defend herself and survive. The result: the Wolf subdues Grandmother and locks her in the wardrobe, quickly donning her nightcap and shawl to impersonate her, setting his trap for Red.",

Inside, the Wolf, disguised beneath a quilt, stiffens and pulls the covers higher, replying in a raspy imitation, 'Come in, dear.' Red hesitates, glancing at the door's scratched wood, then slowly pushes it open, scanning the dim interior for signs of her grandmother. She edges closer, setting her basket on a wooden stool, her senses alert to the odd silence and the heavy breathing from the bed. The Wolf narrows his eyes, watching Red's careful movements, ready to spring if she draws too near. Red, noticing the sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt, tightens her grip on the basket handle and inches back toward the door, preparing to act if needed.
