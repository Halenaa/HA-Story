Red nods, adjusting the basket's weight and tightening her grip on the letter.

Don’t stray, no matter what you hear,' she warns, her voice low and urgent. Red nods, determined, and steps onto the leaf-carpeted path. Behind her, her mother watches until Red disappears among the trees, then turns back to the cottage, gathering firewood as she listens for any unusual sounds from the forest.

Red grips her basket tighter and lifts her chin. The Wolf tilts his head and speaks, his voice gravelly: 'Where are you going, little one, wandering so far from home?' Red replies, steady and clear, 'To my grandmother's cottage, to bring her food and medicine.' The Wolf narrows his eyes, pacing closer, and asks, 'Which path will you take, the sunny lane or the shadowed trail?' Red hesitates, then points to the sunlit track, keeping her gaze locked on the Wolf. The Wolf nods, feigning innocence, before darting into the shadows, paws silent on the damp leaves. Red watches him vanish, then quickens her pace, determined to reach her grandmother before the Wolf can. The encounter leaves the forest quiet again, except for the beating of her heart and the rustle of leaves overhead."}}

The Wolf's objective is to deceive and overpower Grandmother to set a trap for Red; Grandmother's objective is to defend herself and survive.

She edges closer, setting her basket on a wooden stool, her senses alert to the odd silence and the heavy breathing from the bed. The Wolf narrows his eyes, watching Red's careful movements, ready to spring if she draws too near. Red, noticing the sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt, tightens her grip on the basket handle and inches back toward the door, preparing to act if needed.
