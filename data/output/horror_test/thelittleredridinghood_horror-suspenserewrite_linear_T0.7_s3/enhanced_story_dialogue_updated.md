# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Urgent Message

Red stands by the wooden gate, a wicker basket hanging from her arm, as her mother fastens Red's crimson cloak beneath her chin.

The mother presses a folded letter into Red's palm, her voice low and urgent: 'Grandmother is worse.

Take this medicine, but stay on the main path.

' Red nods, adjusting the basket's weight and tightening her grip on the letter.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts the basket to her other arm, glancing at the folded letter tucked on top. She takes a steadying breath and starts down the path with renewed determination. Red hefted the basket onto her arm, noticing with a determined frown how much heavier it felt than usual. She paused at the edge of the familiar trail, her gaze lingering on the carefully folded letter tucked beneath a loaf of bread. Grandmother’s words—her trust—rested inside. Red pressed her fingers gently against the basket, silently promising herself that nothing would happen to its precious contents. Grandmother was counting on her this time, and Red was resolved: she would keep everything safe, no matter what the forest held.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red straightens her shoulders, glancing nervously at the shadowy trees as she presses the letter closer to her chest. Red nodded, shifting the basket on her arm and pulling the letter tighter against her chest. The looming trees whispered secrets in the wind, their shadows stretching across the path ahead. She straightened her shoulders, determined not to let her nerves show. Whatever she encountered in these woods, she resolved silently, she would not let go of Grandmother’s letter. Today, her words mattered, and Red was determined that nothing would stand in the way of delivering them.
She listens to the distant caw of crows and the soft rustle of wind in the trees as her mother inspects the basket, ensuring the jars of broth and cloth-wrapped bread are secure.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red watches her mother’s careful hands, her own fingers fidgeting with her red cloak, eyes bright with excitement and a hint of worry as the wind stirs the edges of the basket. Red watched her mother’s hands move with careful precision, fingers deftly tying the cloth around the warm jar of broth. The wind teased the edges of the basket, carrying with it the distant caw of crows and the gentle rustle of the forest beyond. Red’s own fingers fidgeted with her red cloak, her heart beating with a mixture of excitement and worry. She wanted so much to prove she was ready for this responsibility. “I’ll be careful,” she assured softly, a determined light in her eyes. Grandmother had been waiting for her broth, and Red had made sure to pack the bread exactly as Grandmother liked—with extra butter, tucked neatly beside the jar. She glanced up at her mother, earnest and brave. She wouldn’t let anything spill, not a drop; she was certain of it.
Red's MotherShe tucks a stray curl behind Red’s ear, her brow knitted with both pride and worry as she closes the basket’s lid firmly. Red’s mother tucked a stray curl behind her daughter’s ear, her fingers lingering for a moment as if reluctant to let go. The distant caw of crows echoed through the morning air, mixing with the restless whisper of wind weaving between the trees. With a firm hand, she closed the basket’s lid, her brow furrowed in a familiar blend of pride and worry. The path would be long, the woods unforgiving, and as she looked into Red’s bright eyes, she reminded her softly—never straying from the trail, no matter what might catch her attention.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances down at the basket cradled in her arms, her fingers tracing the checkered cloth, then meets her mother's eyes with a determined nod. Red glanced down at the basket cradled in her arms, her fingers absently tracing the faded checkered cloth stretched over fresh bread and sweet preserves. The distant caw of crows echoed from the woods, and the wind stirred the leaves in gentle, uncertain whispers. Meeting her mother's searching gaze, Red straightened her shoulders, determination flickering in her eyes. “I won’t, Mama,” she promised, her voice steady despite the anticipation thrumming in her chest. “I’ll keep to the path and hold the basket tight, just like you showed me.”
Red promises not to stray, but as she steps onto the path, boots crunching over damp gravel as the forest looms ahead, she finds herself tempted by the mysteries the woods hold beyond the main trail.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates at the forest's edge, glancing back over her shoulder before taking a deep breath and stepping deeper into the trees, her fingers tightening around the basket. Red stood at the edge of the winding forest path, her basket gripped tightly in one hand. The dappled sunlight flickered across her shoes, casting shifting patterns that seemed to beckon her onward. She knew what her mother had said—don’t wander, stay on the trail—but the shadows between the trees whispered of secrets and wonders, just out of sight. A pulse of curiosity tugged at her resolve, and she bit her lip, torn between obedience and the thrill of discovery. She’d promised to be careful, yet her feet itched to move forward, to see what lay beyond the familiar path. How could she keep herself from stepping into the unknown when every leaf and shadow seemed to invite her bravery?
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, glancing back toward home before tightening her grip on the basket and taking another cautious step into the thickening trees. Red hesitated at the edge of the woods, glancing back toward the distant outline of her home. The basket’s handle pressed firmly into her palms as she steeled herself, boots crunching over the damp gravel with each cautious step. The trees closed in, shadows thickening around her, and for a moment she wondered if each footfall was a secret she was sharing with the forest alone. She couldn’t quite decide if her determination to see what lay ahead was courage or simply foolishness, but resolve pushed her forward, deeper into the mysterious green.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, glancing back toward home before tightening her grip on the basket and edging deeper into the dappled shadows. Red hesitated at the edge of the path, her boots pressing into the damp gravel as she glanced back toward the glow of home. The basket in her hand felt heavier than usual. With a steadying breath, she tightened her grip and stepped further beneath the dappled shadows, letting the hush of the forest wrap around her. Each tree seemed to whisper her name, daring her to discover the secrets woven between trunks and tangled undergrowth—stories hidden from those who simply hurried straight through. Red drew herself taller, determined not to stray, but the pull of mystery thrummed quietly beneath her resolve.
Thoughts of adventure and curiosity whisper through her mind, making her question whether she can truly resist wandering.

Red's MotherShe presses her palm to the wood, voice barely steady, and watches as Red disappears into the swirling mist, heart tight with worry and hope. Red’s mother pressed her palm against the wooden doorframe, her fingers trembling just slightly as she watched her daughter’s red cloak vanish into the swirling morning mist. Her heart tightened with both worry and hope, a thousand thoughts crowding her mind. She called after Red, her voice barely steady, reminding her to keep to the path, to avoid speaking to strangers—words woven with caution and love. The woods were deep and full of shadows, but she silently promised that her love would follow Red every step of the way. As the last flash of crimson disappeared among the trees, she whispered, “Be safe, my darling,” the words lingering on the cool air long after Red was gone.
Red's mother watches from the threshold, her hand lingering on the door, eyes tracking Red until the mist swallows her form, still anxious about her daughter's resolve.

----------------------------------------

As the quiet settles over the empty cottage, Red’s footsteps carry her deeper into the unknown. The air thickens with fog and secrets, each step drawing her further from the safety of home and closer to the shadows that wait among the trees. The tangled woods loom ahead, ancient and restless, ready to test the courage she clings to. With her basket held tight, Red crosses the threshold into the haunted forest, where every rustle and whisper hints at dangers yet unseen.

# Chapter 2: Red Enters the Haunted Woods

Red stands at the forest’s entrance, tightening her scarlet cloak around her shoulders as she adjusts the basket of medicine and bread.

Her mother, visibly anxious and protective, repeatedly warns Red about the dangers of the woods, emphasizing not only to stay on the trail but also to be wary of any strange sounds or voices, and to trust no one she encounters.

Red listens as her mother gives several urgent and detailed cautions, extracting a promise from Red that she will not leave the path under any circumstances and will ignore anything attempting to lure her away.

Red's MotherGently places her hands on Red’s shoulders, looking into her eyes with concern. Red’s mother gently placed her hands on her daughter’s shoulders, her thumbs unconsciously tracing small, soothing circles as she looked into Red’s eyes, her gaze laced with concern. “Remember what I said,” she murmured, her voice soft but insistent. “Stay on the trail.” The words were more than a rule—they carried the weight of a lifetime’s wisdom and worry. “It’s not just something I say for no reason, Red. The woods can be unpredictable, and I can’t help but worry about you.” She paused, searching Red’s face, needing assurance. “Promise me you’ll listen. Come home safe to me.”
Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, looking into her eyes with concern. Red’s mother rested her hands gently on Red’s shoulders, her gaze searching her daughter’s face with quiet worry. “Stay on the trail, Red,” she murmured, her voice woven with both warmth and unease. She hesitated for a moment, then continued, her thumb softly tracing a reassuring circle on Red’s sleeve. “There are things in the woods you might not see or expect,” she said, her eyes lingering on Red’s, the weight of her concern evident, “and I couldn’t bear it if something happened to you.”
With her mother’s words echoing in her mind, Red nods solemnly and steps onto the leaf-carpeted path.

Red's MotherShe grips Red’s shoulders, her fingers trembling slightly, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding. Red’s mother gripped her daughter’s shoulders, her fingers trembling ever so slightly as if she could keep Red anchored through sheer force of will. Her eyes searched Red’s face, hungry for a sign that her words would be heeded. In a voice low and urgent, she leaned in, letting her worry show. “Listen to me, Red—promise you won’t leave the path, no matter what calls to you from the woods.” There was a wisdom in her gaze, shadowed by fear, as she pressed on, “There are things out there you’re not ready to face.”
Red's MotherShe gently tucks a lock of Red’s hair behind her ear, her eyes scanning the dark line of trees beyond. Red’s mother reached out with a trembling hand, gently tucking a stray lock of hair behind her daughter’s ear. Her gaze lingered on the dense, looming shadows at the edge of the woods, worry etching lines deep into her brow. “Keep your cloak wrapped tight and remember my words—some voices in the forest are not what they seem,” she murmured, her voice barely more than a hush, thick with urgency and love. The warning hovered between them, as tangible as the morning mist curling at their feet.
Red's MotherShe grips Red's shoulders firmly, her eyes searching her daughter's face for understanding. Red’s mother tightened her grip on her daughter’s shoulders, her gaze intent and searching, as if she could impress her warning deep into Red’s heart. “If you hear anything strange—anything at all—walk faster and do not look back.” The words came out in a low, urgent whisper, weighted by years of caution and a mother’s unwavering love.
Her mother watches, heart heavy with concern, until Red disappears among the trees, then turns back to the cottage, remaining extra vigilant for any unusual sounds from the forest, her anxiety heightened by the seriousness of her warnings.

----------------------------------------

As Red moves deeper into the shadowy tangle of trees, her mother’s words echo in her mind, each step away from the familiar path tightening the knot of apprehension in her chest. The oppressive silence grows heavier, broken only by the occasional snap of a twig beneath her feet. Ahead, the indistinct shapes lurking between the trunks seem to shift and breathe with a life of their own. Unbeknownst to Red, something else is moving through the woods as well—something with keen eyes and silent paws, intent on crossing her path.

# Chapter 3: The Wolf Confronts Red

Red steps carefully along the uneven path, her basket swinging as she scans the undergrowth.

She pauses at a fork, considering the sunny lane and the shadowed trail.

Speaking aloud to herself, she says, 'It's such a bright day—maybe I'll just stick to the sunlit path.

It looks. safer, don't you think?

' As she decides, the Wolf emerges from behind a thicket, his eyes fixed on her basket.

He approaches and, instead of questioning her about her destination and which path she'll take, observes her choice with a sly smile.

Sensing his presence, Red grips her basket tighter and maintains her composure, determined to reach her grandmother safely.

The Wolf disappears into the shadows, perhaps planning to intercept her ahead.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances quickly at the Wolf, her fingers tightening around her basket as she starts toward the sunlit track, her steps deliberate but wary. Sunlight filtered through the trees, dappling the forest floor in shifting patterns of gold. Red paused at the edge of the trail, her basket swinging lightly from her arm. She squinted ahead, eyeing the two paths that split before her—one bathed in warm, reassuring light, the other winding into the shadows beneath tangled branches. A determined set came to her jaw as she studied the brighter trail. It’s such a bright day, she thought, and maybe she’d just stick to the sunlit path. It looked safer, didn’t it? With a quick glance back as if seeking the silent approval of the trees themselves, Red stepped forward, her resolve firm. She would prove she was mature enough, careful enough to make choices for herself—and today, that meant choosing the light.
Red quickens her pace along the sunlit path, the encounter leaving the forest quiet except for her pounding heart and the rustle of leaves.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, the Wolf slips through the shadows, taking a hidden shortcut through the tangled woods. With cunning purpose, he moves swiftly, determined to arrive at Grandmother’s cottage before Red does. As the forest grows thicker and the sunlight fades, the Wolf’s plan takes shape, setting the stage for a new deception awaiting beyond the trees.

# Chapter 4: The Wolf Deceives Grandmother

Grandmother, wrapped in a faded shawl, steps outside her cottage to sweep her porch, the broom bristles scraping against the wooden boards.

The Wolf, slinking through the shadowed trees, watches her from behind a thicket, ears pricked and nose twitching to catch her scent.

Spotting her vulnerability, the Wolf pads silently across the clearing, then straightens and knocks on the door with a heavy paw, mimicking Red's voice.

The Wolf stands on hind legs, smoothing his fur and pitching his voice high and sweet. He taps gently on the old wooden door with a heavy paw, ears pricked for any sound from within. Balancing on his hind legs, the Wolf smoothed the unruly fur along his chest, letting his muzzle curl into a practiced, innocent smile. He pitched his voice high and sweet, a perfect mimicry of a child's timbre, then pressed a heavy paw gently against the weathered wood and tapped twice. His ears flicked, alert for a response from within the cottage. With a softness that belied the menace crouched just beneath the surface, he called out, “Grandmother, it’s me—Red Riding Hood.” The words rolled off his tongue, honeyed and coaxing, as he pressed his advantage. “I’ve brought you some bread and honey, just like Mama said. May I come in?”
Grandmother pauses mid-sweep, peers through the window, and hesitantly unlocks the door.

Grandmother sets down her broom, brushes her hands on her apron, and carefully turns the key in the lock, her eyes darting back to the window as she steels herself to open the door. A sharp knock rattled the cottage door, startling Grandmother from her knitting. She pressed a trembling hand to her chest, feeling her heart flutter with both surprise and worry. “Now, who could that be at this hour?” she murmured, her voice barely louder than the wind sighing through the pines outside. For a moment she hesitated, glancing around the cozy sitting room as if reassurance might be found in the familiar shadows. “Mercy, my heart’s all a-flutter,” she admitted quietly, half to herself, half to the silent ticking of the clock on the mantel. But then she caught herself, shaking her head as resilience steadied her nerves. “Oh, but what if it’s nothing? Or someone in need,” she reasoned, her nurturing instinct outweighing her fear. With a gentle sigh, she set aside her knitting and moved toward the door, her resolve clear in the calm way she added, “Well, I suppose there’s no sense in standing here worrying when I could just see for myself.”
As the Wolf lunges, Grandmother grabs a nearby iron poker and swings, but the Wolf knocks it aside, forcing his way into the cottage.

The Wolf's objective is to deceive and overpower Grandmother to set a trap for Red;

Grandmother's objective is to defend herself and survive.

The result: the Wolf subdues Grandmother and locks her in the wardrobe, quickly donning her nightcap and shawl to impersonate her, setting his trap for Red.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, the cottage has already become a stage for the Wolf’s deception. With Grandmother hidden away and the Wolf cloaked in disguise, an uneasy silence settles over the room. Outside, the faint sound of footsteps approaches along the garden path—Red, carrying her basket, draws nearer to the door, unaware of the danger that now awaits her within.

# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Senses Danger

Red steps carefully onto the flagstone path, clutching her basket as she approaches the cottage door.

She pauses, noticing muddy paw prints pressed into the soft earth near the threshold and the faint, musky odor of wet fur drifting from inside.

Red knocks twice, her voice steady as she calls out, 'Grandmother, it's me—may I come in?

' Inside, the Wolf, disguised beneath a quilt, stiffens and pulls the covers higher, replying in a raspy imitation, 'Come in, dear.

' Red hesitates, glancing at the door's scratched wood, then slowly pushes it open, scanning the dim interior for signs of her grandmother.

She edges closer, setting her basket on a wooden stool, her senses alert to the odd silence and the heavy breathing from the bed.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps tentatively toward the bed, her hands twisting nervously around the handle of her basket, eyes scanning the shadowed corners of the room as she forces her voice to stay calm. Red hesitated on the threshold of her grandmother’s cottage, the silence inside pressing against her like a thick fog. It was never this quiet, not even in the dead of night. She stepped forward, her basket clutched tightly in one hand, and peered into the dim room. "Grandmother?" she called softly, her brow creasing with concern. The voice that answered from the shadows sounded strange—thinner, unfamiliar. A chill prickled at the nape of Red’s neck as she took another cautious step. Compassion warred with unease in her chest, but she forced herself to speak, her tone gentle yet alert. "Are you feeling alright? It's so quiet in here," she said, searching the gloom for her grandmother's familiar face. Her eyes narrowed, catching the odd edge in the reply. "And you sound different. Is something wrong?"
The WolfThe wolf shifts beneath the covers, its gleaming eyes barely visible in the dim light, watching Red with hungry anticipation. Beneath the patchwork quilt, the wolf shifted, a ripple of muscle betraying its restless hunger. Its eyes—sharp, predatory slits that caught the faintest glimmer of light—remained fixed on Red as she edged into the room, her basket trembling slightly in her grasp. The silence settled heavy around them, broken only by the wolf's low, coaxing murmur: "Come closer, dear, so I can see you better—my eyes are not what they used to be." The words dripped with feigned frailty, wrapping around Red like a lure, even as a cold anticipation flickered behind his calculated gaze.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, taking a cautious step forward, her hand tightening around the basket handle as she peers anxiously at the figure in the bed. Red paused at the threshold, her basket dangling from one arm, and studied the figure nestled beneath the patchwork quilt. Something felt off—a prickle of uncertainty danced along her spine. She stepped closer, her gaze lingering on the face framed by wisps of silver hair. The eyes that regarded her seemed larger than she remembered, wide and shining in the dim light. Red’s voice was gentle but edged with concern as she drew nearer, searching her grandmother’s features for reassurance. “Your eyes… they’re so much bigger than I remember, Grandmother—are you sure you’re alright?” she asked, her brow furrowing with worry, unwilling to ignore the strange sense of wrongness settling over the room.
The WolfThe wolf pats the bed, its sharp gaze fixed on Red as she hesitates, glancing nervously at the shadows flickering across the room. The wolf’s paw, heavy and velvet-furred, patted the edge of the bed, its claws just barely indenting the worn quilt. Its eyes—unnaturally bright, yellow and unwavering—tracked Red’s every move as she lingered in the doorway, basket trembling in her grasp. The hush in the room pressed against her ears, broken only by the soft creak of floorboards beneath her cautious steps. “All the better to see you with, my dear,” the wolf murmured, voice smooth as oiled wood, coaxing her forward. “Come, sit by my side so we can talk closely.” The invitation curled through the air, sweet as honey and just as treacherous, leaving Red with the uneasy sense that she was already caught in the wolf’s snare.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, clutching her basket tightly, her eyes darting from the wolf's paws to its face, unease growing as she takes a cautious step back. Red hesitated in the dim light, her basket clutched tight against her chest. She reached out, her fingers almost brushing the hand that rested atop the quilt—a hand that seemed far too large, the knuckles swollen, the skin oddly furry. A chill ran down her spine, but her voice remained steady as she tried to mask her unease. “Your hands look so large and… furry, Grandmother,” she said, her eyes searching the shadowed face before her. “I’ve never noticed that before.”
The WolfThe wolf shifts beneath the blankets, his clawed hand emerging just a bit more, inviting Red with a crooked, unsettling smile. The wolf shifted beneath the heavy blankets, the rough curve of his clawed hand slipping further into view. His smile twisted, crooked and unsettling, as he beckoned her nearer. “All the better to hold you with, my dear,” he murmured, voice velvet-smooth and inviting. “Don’t be afraid,” he coaxed, eyes glinting with unnatural hunger. “Come a little closer so I may embrace you.” Red hesitated, her hand tightening around the handle of her basket as the silence pressed in, thick and expectant, every instinct warning her against the wolf’s gentle persuasion.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a cautious step back, her heart pounding as she clutches the edge of her cloak, eyes darting between the wolf's gleaming teeth and the shadowed corners of the room. Red’s fingers curled tightly around the edge of her crimson cloak as she took a cautious step back, pulse thrumming in her ears. The wolf sat upright in her grandmother’s bed, its shadowy form half-hidden by the quilt, teeth gleaming in the dim light. She set her basket carefully on the wooden stool, senses pricking at the unnatural hush that hung in the air. Red’s eyes darted between the creature’s bared fangs and the dark corners of the room, unease blooming in her chest. With brave resolve, she steadied her voice, her words tremulous but determined. Grandmother’s voice was far too deep, and the teeth—so sharp, so threatening. Why was it baring them at her?
The WolfThe wolf lunges from beneath the covers, its jaws snapping as Red stumbles backward in terror, knocking over the stool and sending the basket tumbling to the floor. Red faltered, her hand still lingering on the basket, as the heavy silence pressed against her. Suddenly, the wolf erupted from beneath the covers, its powerful body launching forward, jaws snapping with merciless intent. Red stumbled back, a gasp escaping her lips as she knocked over the stool; the basket clattered to the floor, scattering its contents. The wolf’s eyes gleamed, hunger and cunning mingling in their depths as it advanced. Its voice curled through the air, cold and triumphant: "All the better to eat you with, my dear."
As Red approaches, she notices the sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt and the unnatural size of 'Grandmother's' eyes and hands.

Growing increasingly suspicious, Red questions the figure in the bed, pressing for details only her real grandmother would know and refusing to approach despite the Wolf's repeated urgings.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red edges another step toward the door, her eyes darting between the Wolf's mouth and the room's exit, knuckles whitening around the basket handle. Red hesitated at the foot of her grandmother’s bed, the basket of treats clutched tightly in one hand. Something felt off—an unease prickled at her, despite the cozy quilt and the familiar scent of herbs in the air. She forced herself to meet her grandmother’s gaze, but her eyes caught instead on the sharp gleam of teeth, far more pointed than she remembered. Swallowing her unease, she managed to ask gently, voice trembling despite her determination to remain calm, “Grandmother, your… your teeth—they look ever so much sharper than I remember. Are you feeling alright?” Her compassionate nature warred with suspicion, but she held her ground, refusing to let fear show.
The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, keeping his head low, eyes glinting as he watches Red's hands clutch the basket. Beneath the quilt, the Wolf shifted with sinuous ease, keeping his great head lowered so only the glint of his watchful eyes and a hint of gleaming teeth showed. He noticed how Red’s hands tightened around the basket’s handle, her knuckles whitening. A sly, almost soothing rumble threaded through his words as he beckoned her closer, “Ah, my dear, old age brings many changes—come closer, and you’ll see I’m quite myself.” The invitation hung between them, thick with false familiarity, while his gaze never wavered from her trembling hands.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red inches back another step, her eyes darting toward the door as she slowly lifts the basket between herself and the figure in the bed. Red inched back another step, her heart thundering as her eyes flicked toward the door. She tightened her grip on the basket’s handle, raising it just enough to put a barrier between herself and the figure nestled beneath her grandmother’s quilt. Trying to steady her voice, she managed a small, brave smile. “I think I’ll stay right here, Grandmother—maybe you’d like some soup from my basket first?”
The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, eyes narrowing as he watches Red edge toward the door, his voice thick with feigned concern. The Wolf shifted beneath the quilt, the fabric rippling over his sinewy form as his yellow eyes tracked Red’s every movement. A glint of teeth flashed, just visible between the folds, but his voice emerged thick with honeyed concern. “Why, child,” he purred, watching as she tightened her grip on the basket handle and edged nearer to the door, “you seem so nervous—surely you’re not afraid of your own grandmother?”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red edges one foot behind her, ready to bolt, eyes darting for any sign of movement beneath the quilt. Red edged one foot behind her, ready to bolt if she had to. Her eyes flickered nervously over the faded patchwork quilt, searching for any hint of movement beneath its heavy folds. The glint of sharp teeth caught the dim light, and her grip tightened around the wicker basket’s handle. Something prickled at the back of her neck—a certainty she couldn’t quite name. The room felt off, as if shadows had thickened in the corners and the air had grown heavier. Red swallowed, her voice low and careful as she ventured, “There’s something about this room that feels different, Grandmother… almost as if I’m not alone here with you after all.”
The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, eyes narrowing as he watches Red edge closer to the doorway, his claws tensing beneath the covers. The Wolf shifted beneath the heavy quilt, his luminous eyes narrowing as he watched Red hesitate at the threshold, one paw curling with restrained anticipation beneath the covers. The sharp glint of teeth flashed from beneath the fabric, and Red’s grip on the basket handle tightened, her knuckles paling. In a voice both silken and sly, the Wolf beckoned her closer, coaxing, “Nonsense, child—come into the light and let me get a better look at you; your dear old grandmother has missed you so.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red slides her foot stealthily toward the door, her eyes never leaving the sharp glint of teeth, ready to bolt at the slightest wrong move. Red slid her foot stealthily toward the door, her grip tightening on the basket handle. The sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt caught her gaze, and she forced herself not to flinch. Heart pounding but voice steady, she asked, “If you’ve missed me so, Grandmother, why do you keep hiding your face in the shadows?” She kept her eyes fixed on the shrouded figure, every muscle coiled and ready to bolt if the answer wasn’t what she hoped for.
The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, his claws tensing beneath the quilt as Red’s hand hovers over the basket, her body poised to flee. Beneath the heavy quilt, the Wolf shifted, claws flexing with barely restrained anticipation. Candlelight flickered across the sharp glint of teeth half-hidden in shadow, and Red’s fingers tightened around the basket’s handle, her body taut and ready to spring away. The Wolf’s voice slithered through the gloom—soft, almost plaintive, yet edged with something cold and dangerous. The candlelight hurts my old eyes, dear, he crooned, beckoning her with a deceptive tenderness. Just a step closer, and I'll show you I'm still the grandmother you remember.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red’s voice trembles as she edges her foot back toward the door, fingers tightening around the basket as she prepares to bolt if the answer falters. Red’s voice trembled as she edged her foot closer to the door, her fingers tightening around the basket handle until her knuckles whitened. She kept her eyes fixed on the sharp glint of teeth peeking beneath the quilt, heart hammering in her chest. Still, she forced herself to sound brave, determined not to let fear win. “If you’re really my grandmother,” Red said, her words steady despite the flutter in her stomach, “then tell me—where did I hide the blue ribbon you gave me last spring?” The question hung in the air, a test as much for herself as for the figure in the bed, and she braced to bolt if the answer faltered.
The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, muscles tensing, as his eyes flicker hungrily in the dim light. The Wolf shifted beneath the quilt, sinewy muscles rippling under the patchwork as his eyes flickered with a hungry gleam in the dim light. Red, catching the sharp glint of teeth just visible beneath the covers, instinctively tightened her grip on the basket handle. With a voice oiled in deceptive warmth, the Wolf assured her, “Why, of course, child—it was tucked beneath your pillow, just as you always do with your treasures.” His gaze never wavered from her trembling hands, and he stretched a clawed paw toward her, beckoning softly, “Now, come here and let me hold your hand.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a slow, deliberate step backward, her eyes darting to the door as her knuckles whiten around the basket handle, poised to bolt or defend herself. Red took a slow, deliberate step backward, her eyes flicking to the door, every muscle coiled to spring. Her knuckles whitened around the basket handle, a lifeline she refused to relinquish. As she scanned the figure in her grandmother’s bed, a cold certainty crept along her spine—the sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt was impossible to miss. Heart pounding, she tightened her grip and, with steady resolve, thought, My grandmother never wanted to hold my hand with claws that sharp.
The Wolf becomes more insistent, his disguise slipping as Red's interrogation continues.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps quietly closer to the bed, her basket held tightly in front of her. She narrows her eyes, scanning the Wolf's features beneath the covers, her body tense and ready to react. Red stepped quietly into the dim cottage, her basket swinging gently at her side. The fire crackled, casting uncertain shadows across her grandmother’s face. Something was off. Red’s eyes lingered on her grandmother’s features—the eyes, unusually wide and glassy, seemed almost unfamiliar. She hesitated, voice low but steady as she moved closer, “Grandmother, your eyes look so strange.” The words slipped out, colored by concern and growing unease. Red’s brow furrowed as she listened to the woman speak; her grandmother’s voice sounded rougher, harsher than the gentle tones Red remembered. She reached out, searching for reassurance. “And your voice—it sounds rougher than I remember. Are you feeling quite yourself?” Despite the chill skittering up her spine, Red stood her ground, determined to understand what was wrong—even if the truth was more unsettling than she could imagine.
The Wolf leans forward, his gaze sharpening as he subtly flexes his claws beneath the covers. The Wolf leaned forward, the coarse fur along his spine bristling with anticipation. His yellow eyes glinted beneath the low eaves of the bonnet, and beneath the tangled blankets, his claws flexed in silent readiness. "Ah, child," he purred, his voice warm and honeyed, "perhaps it's just the shadows playing tricks, but come closer so I can see you better." The words slithered from his muzzle, smooth and inviting, even as his gaze sharpened, never straying from Red's uncertain form at the foot of the bed.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red edges closer but keeps her basket clutched tightly, her eyes darting to the heavy quilt where the Wolf's paw twitches impatiently. Red edged closer, her fingers tightening around the handle of her basket, pulse quickening as she watched the lump beneath the heavy quilt. The Wolf’s paw twitched, a subtle shiver of impatience betraying the creature’s tension. Still, Red kept her voice steady, a calm mask over the suspicion in her chest. If this really was her grandmother, she reasoned, then the answer would come easily. She drew a slow breath and, eyes never leaving the shadowed figure on the bed, asked, “If you’re truly my grandmother, then tell me—where did you hide the lavender sachet I gave you last time?”
The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, claws tensing beneath the blanket as his eyes glint hungrily in the dim light. Beneath the heavy quilt, the Wolf shifted, muscles coiling with predatory intent. His claws flexed, concealed beneath the blanket, while his amber eyes flickered with a hungry gleam in the half-light. He watched Red linger at the threshold, uncertainty etched across her face. Voice slithering with false warmth, he murmured, “Ah, my dear, old age clouds my memory—but why not step nearer and remind me yourself?” Each word was a lure, spun from cunning and wrapped in the promise of safety, as he waited—tense and poised—for her to draw close enough for the game to end.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket and takes a wary step back, her gaze fixed on the Wolf, who shifts restlessly beneath the covers, his hands tensing into claws beneath the quilt. Red tightened her grip on the wicker handle, feeling the reassuring weight of her basket as she edged a step away from the bed. The covers trembled with the Wolf’s shifting bulk, his hands curled beneath the quilt—too tense, too clawed, nothing like her grandmother’s gentle fingers. Heart thudding but voice steady, Red held her ground, resolve hardening in her chest. She fixed her gaze on the Wolf’s eyes—those strange, glinting eyes—and said carefully, “No, I think I’ll stay right here until you answer me.” She refused to let fear chase her from the room. “Because there’s something in your eyes that isn’t my grandmother at all.”
The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, muscles coiled, his eyes glinting hungrily as Red edges closer to the doorway, her hand tightening around her basket. Beneath the mound of blankets, the Wolf shifted, sinewy muscles tightening as he watched Red’s hesitant approach. His eyes, sharp and glinting with a predatory hunger, tracked the way her hand whitened around the handle of her basket. With a silken, wounded tone, he murmured, “You wound me, child—surely you would not doubt your own grandmother’s love?” The words slid from his jaws like smoke, soft and sweet, meant to lure her closer, even as he readied himself for whatever suspicion flickered behind her wary gaze.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red grips her basket tightly, her gaze locked on the Wolf, refusing to move closer as she takes a careful step back toward the door. Red’s knuckles whitened around the wicker handle of her basket as she took a cautious step back, her eyes never leaving the Wolf’s looming form by the bedside. Fear prickled at her spine, but she drew herself up, voice steady and brave as she faced him down. If he truly cared for her, if any warmth lingered in those golden eyes, he would prove it now. “If you truly love me,” she said, her tone edged with challenge and hope, “then show me your hands—let me see if they are as gentle as they should be.”
The Wolf slowly stretches out his claws from beneath the covers, his gaze fixed hungrily on Red as she inches backward, her hand tightening around the basket she carries. The Wolf stretched languidly, muscles rippling beneath his thick, silvery pelt as he circled closer to his wary companion. His amber eyes gleamed with a predatory amusement. “Of course, my dear,” he murmured, lowering his head so his massive paws were on display—each digit tipped with a gleaming, deadly claw. “See how large and strong they are?” He flexed them, feigning gentleness, his voice honeyed and reassuring. “Perfect for keeping you safe…” His lips curled just enough to hint at a smile, the edge of his words sharpening into something darker. “Or for catching anything that tries to harm us.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a cautious step backward, her gaze sharp and unwavering, as the Wolf’s lips curl into a sly, predatory grin. Red took a measured step backward, her gaze unwavering as she studied the Wolf’s hands—large, clawed, nothing like the comforting fingers she remembered from her grandmother’s gentle touch. A chill prickled along her spine, but she forced herself to stand tall, voice steady despite the tremor of fear beneath. “Those hands,” she said, never breaking eye contact, “look more like they could tear than comfort.” Determined not to let dread overwhelm her, she demanded, “Tell me truly—what have you done with my grandmother?” The Wolf’s lips curled into a sly, predatory grin, tension crackling in the air between them as Red braced herself to confront the danger she now suspected.
Sensing imminent danger, Red stands her ground, demanding to see 'Grandmother's' hands and challenging the Wolf directly about her grandmother's whereabouts.

The Wolf, realizing his ruse is failing, prepares to attack, while Red, now fully alert to the threat, readies herself to resist or escape.

The scene ends with both characters locked in a tense standoff, Red's suspicions confirmed and the Wolf poised to pounce.

----------------------------------------

As the tension in the cottage reaches its peak, Red’s instincts sharpen, compelling her to scan her surroundings for any sign of her true grandmother. In that fraught moment, subtle clues begin to emerge, hinting at a sinister plot lurking within the shadows. As the Wolf shifts uneasily, Red’s gaze catches something out of place—a chilling revelation that marks the beginning of the next perilous encounter.

# Chapter 6: Red Discovers the Wolf’s Trap

Red approaches a narrow path lined with tangled brambles and notices a patch of disturbed earth near a half-rotten log.

She kneels, brushes aside leaves, and discovers a snare hidden beneath a layer of moss.

The Wolf, concealed behind a thicket, watches Red’s movements carefully, his yellow eyes tracking her every gesture.

Red, determined to protect her grandmother, inspects the trap’s mechanism and uses a sturdy stick to disable its trigger.

The Wolf steps forward, his voice low and smooth, 'You’re clever for a child.

The Wolf circles slowly, his gaze never leaving the child's face, a faint, knowing smile curling at the edge of his mouth. The Wolf moved in a slow, deliberate circle, each step silent on the moss, his cold amber gaze fixed unblinking on the child’s face. A faint, knowing smile curled at the edge of his mouth as he drew closer, his voice low and smooth as velvet. “You’re clever for a child,” he murmured, the words slipping out like smoke. “Most wander these woods with fear in their eyes and foolishness on their tongues—but you, you watch. You listen.” His smile widened, teeth glinting beneath the shadow of his muzzle. “That’s dangerous.”
But this is no place for games.

The Wolf steps from the gloom, eyes glinting with cold intent, voice low and edged with menace. The Wolf slipped from the gloom, its massive form materializing between the twisted trees. Cold intent glinted in its eyes as it fixed its gaze on the trembling traveler. The low growl of its voice slithered through the darkness, edged with menace. "This is no place for games," the Wolf warned, circling with predatory grace. Shadows pooled around its paws, thick and hungry. "The shadows here hold teeth and secrets—playfulness will get you eaten."
The Wolf narrows its eyes, hackles bristling as it melts deeper into the gloom. The Wolf narrowed its eyes, hackles bristling as it melted deeper into the gloom, its presence barely more than a ripple in the shadows. Its voice slithered out from the darkness—low, dangerous, and edged with threat. "If you value your life," it warned, each word carefully measured, "tread carefully and leave your laughter at the edge of the wood."
' Red stands, gripping her basket tightly, and replies, 'I know your tricks, and I won’t let you hurt my family.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, planting her feet firmly. Her voice rings clear and unwavering as she stands her ground, eyes narrowed with resolve. Red squared her shoulders, feet planted firmly in the leaf-littered earth as she met the creature’s eyes without a flicker of fear. Her fingers tightened around the wicker handle of her basket, but her voice rang out, clear and unwavering. She refused to let him see even a hint of doubt. “You think you can frighten me,” she declared, her gaze unwavering, “but I’ve seen what you’re capable of.” Determination burned in her chest, fierce and bright. “I won’t back down—not when my family’s at stake.” She drew herself up, the shadows of the forest curling around her like a cloak, and added, “If you want to get to them, you’ll have to go through me first.”
' The Wolf circles, tail low, calculating his next move, while Red keeps her eyes on him, ready to defend herself and warn her grandmother.

----------------------------------------

The air between them crackles with tension as predator and prey become equals in a desperate standoff. In the charged silence, every heartbeat counts, and Red must rely on her wits and courage to outmaneuver the Wolf’s cunning. As the shadows lengthen and the danger intensifies, the struggle for survival begins in earnest—forcing Red to face the true depths of her bravery.

# Chapter 7: Red Fights for Survival

Red slams the cottage door shut, bolts it, and urgently warns Grandmother to stay hidden.

Grandmother, shaken, hides behind the cupboard as Red listens to the Wolf prowling on the porch.

Red and Grandmother quietly strategize: they stay away from the windows, hold hands for comfort, and discuss possible ways to trick the Wolf or call for help if he tries to break in.

Both remain silent, hoping the Wolf will leave, but vow to scream together if the Wolf attempts to enter.

----------------------------------------

Outside, heavy footsteps crunch through the underbrush, breaking the tense silence that has settled over the battered cottage. Inside the cellar, Red and Grandmother tense, unsure whether to fear a new threat or hope for rescue. As the Wolf circles the house, a distant shout echoes through the woods, signaling that fate—and perhaps help—is drawing near, ready to alter the course of their desperate struggle.

# Chapter 8: The Hunter Intervenes

Red, clutching her basket tightly, steps cautiously through the tangled roots toward her grandmother's cottage, her boots squelching in wet earth.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances over her shoulder, pulling her cloak tighter around herself as the trees seem to close in, but she takes a deep breath and pushes forward, gripping the basket with white-knuckled determination. Red tightened her grip on the basket, the familiar weight of bread and jam reassuring against her palm. The woods pressed closer today, shadows pooling thick beneath ancient trees, but she kept her chin high. Just a little farther, she told herself. You can do this. Grandma will be so glad to see you—and you promised Mama you’d bring the bread and jam, no matter what. Even as the forest seemed darker than usual, Red pushed forward, quickening her pace and refusing to let uncertainty slow her steps.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances nervously over her shoulder, then steels herself and presses on, gripping her basket tighter as the shadows deepen around her. Red paused for a moment, glancing nervously over her shoulder as the forest seemed to close in behind her. Every snap of a twig made her heart jump, but she gritted her teeth and pressed on, refusing to let anything—no matter how dark or frightening—keep her from reaching Grandma. Her grip tightened around the woven handle of her basket, knuckles white, as she maneuvered carefully through the tangle of roots beneath her feet, determined not to falter while shadows gathered all around.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the basket and quickens her pace, glancing warily at the looming trees. Red tightened her grip on the basket, weaving carefully through the tangled roots that threatened to trip her. The trees pressed in, thick and silent, their shadows stretching long across the path. She quickened her pace, heart drumming in her chest, and forced her gaze straight ahead. It’s just the wind, she tried to reassure herself, not something watching from the shadows. Still, every crack of a branch or sigh of leaves made her nerves prickle, but she refused to let fear slow her steps—Grandmother was waiting, and Red was determined to prove she could make the journey on her own.
The Wolf, his fur matted and eyes glinting, blocks her path, baring his teeth and circling Red, attempting to cut off her escape.

The Wolf paces in a slow, deliberate circle around Red, hackles raised, his gaze fixed hungrily on her trembling form. The Wolf’s fur bristled, ragged and dark as he prowled in a measured circle around her, each movement deliberate and hungry. His yellow eyes never left Red, tracking every tremor that ran through her small frame. Blocking her path with his hulking form, he bared his teeth in a crooked, predatory grin. “Well, well,” he murmured, voice a low growl that curled through the heavy air, “where do you think you’re going, little girl?” His gaze swept over the tangled undergrowth, then snapped back to her, cold and calculating. “The woods are thick,” he crooned, the threat in his words barely veiled, “and I’m the only way through.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, her voice trembling as she tries to edge away from the circling Wolf, eyes darting for an opening. Red squared her shoulders, refusing to let fear show as she faced the shadow blocking her path. Her fingers tightened around the basket handle, knuckles white, but her voice stayed steady. “Please,” she said, forcing calm into her words. “I just want to see my grandmother—let me pass and I won’t bother you.” Her eyes searched the gloom for any sign of mercy, determined not to back down, even as her heart pounded in her chest.
The Wolf narrows the circle, his claws scraping the earth as he edges closer, blocking every attempt Red makes to slip past him. The Wolf’s fur bristled, ragged and damp against the chill air, as he tightened his circle around Red. Each step was deliberate—his claws raked the earth, gouging lines into the tangled roots and moss. Every time Red tried to dart left or right, he shifted, blocking her escape with his hulking form. His eyes gleamed with a cruel amusement, teeth bared in a grin that was all hunger and promise.

He lowered his head, voice curling out in a rasp as he pressed closer, “Ah, but the path to your dear grandmother runs straight through me.” The words slithered between them, heavy with threat and mockery. “Maybe you should have thought twice before wandering so far alone.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, edging away as the Wolf circles closer, her eyes darting for any gap to slip past. Red’s grip on her basket tightened as the Wolf prowled closer, his matted fur brushing ominously against the brambles. She edged back, heart pounding, scanning the tangled forest for any opening—a narrow gap between the roots, a break in the undergrowth—anywhere she might escape his looming shadow. Swallowing her fear, Red straightened her shoulders and met his glinting eyes, her voice steady despite the tremor she couldn’t quite hide. “I—I won’t cause any trouble, I promise, just let me go.” The words slipped out, quiet but firm, her resolve pressing against the terror that threatened to swallow her whole.
The Wolf circles closer, his snout inches from Red, blocking any hope of escape with his massive bulk. Massive and silent, the Wolf prowled ever closer, his matted fur brushing the damp leaves as he circled her, a living shadow blocking every avenue of escape. His breath, hot and fetid, brushed against Red’s cheek as his snout hovered just inches away. His lips curled back to reveal a wicked smile, teeth gleaming in the gloom. “Trouble’s exactly what I hunger for, little morsel—so why don’t you stay and entertain me?” he purred, his voice a low, delighted growl that seemed to vibrate through the marrow of her bones.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tightly, edging backwards as the Wolf prowls closer, blocking every retreat. Red’s fingers tightened around the wicker handle of her basket, the willow biting into her palm as she took a cautious step backward. The Wolf’s hulking form shifted, muscles tensing beneath his matted fur, every movement calculated to block her escape. His yellowed teeth gleamed as he circled, eyes never leaving hers. Red’s voice, thin but steady despite the thundering of her heart, slipped out as a plea. “I—I don’t have anything you’d want, please, just let me go!” Her words hung in the cold air, brave even in fear, as she stood her ground.
The Wolf edges closer, his claws scraping the earth as he blocks every step Red tries to take, his breath hot and ragged in the cold forest air. The Wolf edged ever closer, his claws raking slow, deliberate furrows in the frozen earth, each scrape punctuated by the heavy, ragged gusts of his breath. He moved with a predator’s certainty, circling until every timid step Red tried to take was met by a wall of matted fur and bared teeth. His eyes glinted with a cruel amusement as he blocked her path, lips curling into a sly, hungry grin.

“Oh, but you do,” he murmured, voice low and silken as he leaned in, his words coiling through the shadows between them. “You have yourself, and that’s worth more to me than anything in your little basket.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, inching backward as her voice trembles, eyes darting for any gap in the Wolf's circling form. Red’s fingers curled tighter around her basket as she took a cautious step backward, heart hammering against her ribs. The Wolf’s matted fur bristled in the dappled light, his yellow eyes never leaving her face as he prowled in a slow, deliberate circle, blocking every escape route. Red’s voice quivered, but determination steadied her words. “Please, there must be something else you want—” she offered desperately, eyes scanning for the slightest gap in his looming form. “I’ll give you my food, my cloak, anything!” She tried to sound brave, hoping her willingness to bargain might distract him, even as she plotted her next move.
The Wolf lunges forward a step, his shadow looming over Red as he snaps his jaws inches from her arm, forcing her to stumble backward into the tangled undergrowth. The Wolf lunged forward, his mottled fur bristling as his shadow spilled over Red, jaws snapping so close she could feel the heat of his breath against her skin. Instinct forced her backward into the tangled undergrowth, heart drumming wildly in her chest. Circling her with slow, deliberate steps, he bared his teeth, eyes glinting with a cruel amusement. 

He leaned in, his voice a low, velvety growl that curled around her fear. Her trembling, he murmured, was sweeter to him than any meal. "Run if you wish," he promised, each word laced with predatory certainty, "but I'll always be right behind you."
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, her eyes darting desperately for an opening as she slowly backs away from the circling Wolf. Red’s grip tightened on her basket, knuckles white as she edged away from the Wolf, every muscle poised for flight. The creature’s matted fur bristled, his yellow eyes locked on hers, and his jaws parted in a silent snarl. Red’s heart thudded in her chest, but she refused to let her fear paralyze her. Desperate for any escape, she forced herself to meet his gaze, her voice trembling yet defiant as she stammered, “Y-you’re scaring me—why are you doing this?” The words slipped out, a fragile shield against the menace circling her, echoing her determination to understand rather than simply run.
The Wolf lunges closer, his breath hot and rancid, snapping his jaws inches from Red's face to drive her back against a gnarled tree. The Wolf lunged forward, his breath hot and fetid as it washed over Red’s cheek. His jaws snapped shut with a vicious click, missing her face by a whisper and forcing her to stumble backward until her spine pressed against the rough bark of a gnarled tree. Circling her, his matted fur bristling and gold eyes glinting with predatory glee, he bared his teeth in a slow, deliberate smile. “Fear,” he murmured, savoring the word as if it were a rare delicacy, “makes the chase all the more delicious.” His gaze lingered on the tremor in her hands, the widening of her eyes. “And you, my dear,” he added, voice low and velvet-smooth, “are already halfway devoured by it.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tightly, eyes darting for an opening as she inches backward, ready to dash into the shadows of the trees. Red’s grip on her basket tightened, knuckles whitening as the Wolf prowled before her, blocking every possible escape. His fur bristled and his teeth flashed, but she refused to back down. Swallowing her fear, she edged slowly toward the shadowed trees, eyes scanning for the smallest gap in his defenses. The words burst from her throat, trembling but fierce—she would not let him win. If he dared to lunge, she’d scream, she’d run—she’d do anything to get away.
The Wolf lunges closer, his shadow looming over Red as he snaps his jaws inches from her outstretched hand. The Wolf lunged closer, his shadow stretching ominously over Red’s trembling figure. His fur, matted and bristling with menace, caught in the faint shafts of moonlight that pierced the tangled branches overhead. Circling her with slow, deliberate steps, he snapped his jaws inches from her outstretched hand, the sound sharp and chilling in the silent forest. Red’s breath hitched, but the Wolf’s eyes glittered with cruel amusement. “Scream all you like, little one,” he growled, his voice a low, rumbling threat that seemed to echo among the trees. “No one will hear you but the trees—and the sharpness of my teeth.”
Suddenly, The Hunter emerges from the thicket, boots crunching on gravel, raising his axe and shouting, 'Step away from the girl, beast!

' The Wolf snarls, lunges toward The Hunter, but the woodsman swings his axe, driving the Wolf back.

The Wolf circles The Hunter, hackles raised, lips curled in a snarl, muscles coiled and ready to strike again, eyes gleaming with hunger and fury. Hackles bristling and lips peeled back in a vicious snarl, the Wolf stalked in a relentless circle around the Hunter, muscles taut with the promise of violence. Hunger and fury blazed in his eyes as he feinted forward, only to be driven back by the woodsman’s swinging axe. Yet even as he retreated, the Wolf’s voice slithered through the gloom, low and mocking—“You think that blade will save you, human?” His gaze never wavered, burning with predatory certainty. “This forest is mine. Every shadow, every breath—belongs to me.”
The Hunter tightens his grip on the axe, feet braced, eyes locked with the Wolf as the wind stirs between them. The Hunter braced himself, boots dug deep into the leaf-littered earth, the haft of his axe steady in his calloused hands. He met the Wolf’s blazing eyes without a tremor. As the beast snarled and lunged, the woodsman swung, steel flashing in the cold moonlight and forcing the creature to skid back, hackles raised. Breath misted between them, but the Hunter’s voice rang low and firm, unwavering even in the face of those snapping jaws: “Not while I draw breath, beast—my family walks these woods, and tonight, your reign ends.”
The Wolf circles, hackles raised, eyes locked on the Hunter's axe, muscles coiled for another attack. Hackles bristling, the Wolf prowled in a tight circle, every sinew taut beneath its mottled pelt. Its golden eyes never wavered from the gleam of the Hunter’s axe, reflecting both threat and invitation. The woodsman stood his ground, knuckles white on the haft, and when the Wolf darted forward with a guttural snarl, the axe swung in a sharp arc, forcing the beast to recoil. Undeterred, the Wolf’s lips curled into a mocking grin. “You trespass with your fragile courage,” it murmured, voice a low rasp that seemed to slither between the trees, “but hunger sharpens my teeth more than fear ever dulled them.” The words hung in the air, a promise and a warning, as the Wolf crouched once more, muscles bunching, ready to test that courage again.
The Hunter plants his boots, axe raised, as the Wolf crouches low, muscles bunching for another savage leap. Boots firm in the mossy earth, the Hunter stood his ground, axe poised and ready, eyes never leaving the Wolf’s sinewy form. As the beast snarled and gathered itself for another vicious leap, the woodsman’s voice rang out—steady, unwavering, almost reverent beneath the watchful moon. “Then come, Wolf—let the moon witness which of us leaves these woods alive.” The words hung in the crisp night air, a challenge shaped by courage and resolve, as the Hunter squared his shoulders, prepared to meet the wild fury head-on.
Red scrambles behind The Hunter, her objective to reach her grandmother now dependent on his protection.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tightly, her voice trembling as she glances nervously over her shoulder, then looks up at the Hunter with pleading eyes. Red’s breath quickened as she pressed forward through the tangled underbrush, her determination undimmed by the sharp branches that snagged at her cloak. “We have to hurry,” she said, her voice edged with urgency. The woods felt different tonight—darker, heavier, as if the shadows themselves whispered warnings. Red’s thoughts raced to her grandmother, alone in the cottage beyond the twisting paths. She couldn't bear the idea of anything happening to her. Compassion and resolve mingled in her chest as she glanced at her companion, her eyes fierce. “My grandmother’s all alone out there. I don’t know what I’d do if anything happened to her.” With that, she squared her shoulders and plunged deeper into the forest, driven by love and the need to prove herself.
The Hunter scans the shadowy trees, tightening his grip on his axe as he leads Red down the narrow path, every sense alert for danger. The Hunter moved with practiced silence, his sharp gaze sweeping the shadowy trees as he tightened his hold on his axe. Each footfall was measured, his senses tuned to the faintest rustle or snap in the undergrowth. Red scrambled just behind him, her trust in his broad-shouldered figure the only thing steadying her nerves. Without glancing back, his voice was low but certain, carrying reassurance through the gloom. “Stay close, Red—I know these woods better than anything that hunts in them,” he promised, his words edged with both confidence and fierce protectiveness. “Nothing will reach your grandmother as long as I’m here.”
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, glancing nervously at every shadow as she follows the Hunter deeper into the trees. Red clutched her basket tighter, the woven handle digging into her palm as she hurried after the Hunter. Every shifting shadow beneath the looming trees sent a shiver through her, and though she tried to keep her pace steady, her heart thudded with apprehension. She glanced toward the Hunter’s broad back, her voice barely above a whisper as she confessed her worry. What if the wolf was already waiting for them, lurking somewhere ahead in the tangled darkness? The thought pressed heavily on her mind, but Red kept moving, determined not to let fear hold her back.
The Hunter checks his rifle, scanning the shadows ahead, and motions for Red to move quietly at his side. The Hunter paused, fingers deftly checking the rifle’s chamber, his gaze sweeping the tangled shadows between the trees. With a silent nod, he signaled for Red to stay close, his presence a calm anchor amid the shifting darkness. As Red scrambled behind him, heart pounding and cloak snagging on brambles, he murmured, voice steady and sure, “If the wolf dares to show himself, he'll find out these woods have more than one guardian tonight.” The promise in his words wrapped around her like a shield, urging her onward through the threatening hush of the forest.
The Wolf retreats into the shadows, growling, while The Hunter stands guard, scanning the forest for further threats.

The Wolf stiffens, yellow eyes glinting from beneath the underbrush, hackles raised as he tracks every movement in the gloom. The Wolf stiffened, muscles coiling beneath his ragged pelt as his yellow eyes glinted from the shadows, tracking each subtle movement in the moonlit gloom. Hackles raised, he retreated deeper into the underbrush, a low growl rumbling in his throat. The Hunter stood at the edge of the clearing, gaze sweeping the tangled darkness, alert for any sign of threat. From the depths of the shadow, the Wolf’s voice slithered out, cold and mocking, as he watched the Hunter’s vigilance. “You think the danger’s passed, Hunter?” he rasped, his words weaving through the hush of leaves. “The trees still whisper of hungry things.”
The Hunter tightens their grip on their weapon, eyes darting between the shifting shadows. The Hunter tightened his grip on his weapon, every muscle tensed as his eyes flickered between the restless shadows beneath the trees. He watched the Wolf slink backward, a low growl rumbling from the darkness, but the Hunter held his ground, unwavering. He trusted neither the silence that pressed in around him nor the murmured threats that seemed to coil in the Wolf’s retreat. Danger, he knew from long experience, often waited for the careless—a lesson he would not soon forget.
The Wolf's eyes glint in the dim light as he circles just beyond the Hunter's reach, ears twitching at every crackle in the underbrush. The Wolf’s eyes glinted coldly in the dim light as he circled just beyond the Hunter’s reach, his lean form melting in and out of the shadows with each cautious step. Ears flicking to catch every subtle crackle in the underbrush, he let a low growl ripple from his throat—a warning and a promise. Then, with a voice as smooth and unsettling as the night itself, he retreated further into the darkness, his words curling through the trees: Even the boldest hunter, he mused, could become prey when the shadows grew long.
The Hunter tightens his grip on his bow, eyes darting to a sudden rustle deeper among the trees. The Hunter’s fingers curled tighter around the smooth wood of his bow as the Wolf melted into the shadows, a low growl rumbling from deep within its chest. The forest seemed to hold its breath. Eyes narrowed, the Hunter scanned the shifting gloom, muscles tensed for whatever threat lingered just out of sight. Without looking away, his voice was low but steady, echoing into the hush, “Then let neither of us blink, Wolf—something out there is watching, and it cares for neither tooth nor arrow.”
The scene ends with Red and The Hunter moving quickly towards the cottage, determined to reach Grandmother before the Wolf regroups.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red grabs the Hunter’s hand, her eyes fierce with determination, and urges them forward through the darkening woods toward the cottage. Red seized the Hunter's hand, her grip firm and urgent as she pulled him deeper into the shadowed woods. Determination blazed in her eyes, every step purposeful despite the branches grasping at her cloak. “We can’t slow down,” she insisted, voice low but resolute. Grandmother was depending on them—and somewhere in the darkness, the wolf’s cunning waited like a trap. Red kept her gaze fixed on the barely visible path ahead. If they hesitated, there was no telling what danger might befall her grandmother next. She pressed forward, quickening their pace, her words carrying conviction: they had to stay together, alert for anything the forest or its predators might throw in their way.
The Hunter quickens his pace, scanning the darkening forest ahead for any sign of the Wolf as they approach the cottage. The Hunter quickened his pace, his footsteps sure and silent as he scanned the darkening forest for any sign of the Wolf. He glanced over his shoulder at Red, his voice low but steady. "You're right—every second matters," he said, his protective instinct clear in the set of his jaw. "I won't let that beast hurt anyone else." Gesturing for her to stay close, he added, "Stay behind me and keep your eyes sharp." With that, he led the way through the deepening shadows, every muscle tense and ready, determined to reach the cottage before it was too late.
----------------------------------------

As the adrenaline of their narrow escape faded, the aftermath of the ordeal settled heavily around them. With the Wolf vanquished and her grandmother safe, Red found herself standing at a crossroads—not just at the edge of the forest, but within her own heart. The choices she made now, in the lingering silence after the chaos, would shape the path ahead. As dusk deepened and the hunter led them away from the shattered cottage, Red realized a final decision awaited her—one she could no longer postpone.

# Chapter 9: Red Makes a Final Decision

Red, clutching her basket, steps carefully over tangled roots and damp leaves, her boots crunching on gravel as she approaches the cottage.

Feeling uneasy about the dangers lurking in the woods, she thinks aloud, reassuring herself and considering her safety.

She scans her surroundings for a sturdy stick to use as a potential weapon, determined not to be caught off guard.

With a strong branch in hand, Red moves forward, prepared for any threat she might encounter.

As she nears the cottage, the Wolf emerges from behind a thicket, blocking her path.

The Wolf, eyes glinting, circles Red, sniffing the air hungrily.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red crouches low, eyes darting between the trees, and begins searching the forest floor for a solid branch to use as a weapon. Red paused at the edge of the shadow-dappled path, the hush of the forest pressing in around her. Her heart beat steadily—she refused to let it race. Stay calm, she told herself, steadying her grip on the basket. After all, there was no telling what might be lurking behind those mossy trunks or watching from the tangled underbrush. Determined not to be caught off guard, she let her gaze sweep the ground until she spotted a sturdy branch—a makeshift staff, just in case. With a breath to steel herself, Red picked it up, feeling the weight settle comfortably in her hand, ready for whatever the woods might send her way.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red slowly crouches to examine a thick branch half-buried in the leaves, eyes darting around the shadows. Red crouched low, her fingers brushing aside damp leaves until they found the rough surface of a thick branch half-buried beneath the undergrowth. She tightened her grip around the handle, feeling its reassuring weight. Eyes flicking warily through the shifting shadows, she thought, A strong stick could come in handy—no telling what I might run into. Determination settled over her like a cloak as she rose, ready for whatever the forest might send her way.
Little Red Riding Hood (Red)She crouches down, eyes narrowed, and carefully searches through the undergrowth for the thickest branch she can find. She crouched low, fingers brushing aside damp leaves as she searched intently for the thickest branch hidden among the tangled undergrowth. Her jaw tightened in determination, and she wrapped her hand more firmly around the basket's handle. If anything tried to mess with her, at least she wouldn’t be caught off guard, she reassured herself, scanning the ground with sharp, unwavering eyes.
Red, voice steady, calls out, 'I know what you are after, Wolf.

But you won't have my grandmother.

' She confronts the Wolf with her basket and branch, forcing him to retreat into the shadows.

Red catches her breath and hurries toward the cottage, intent on reaching her grandmother before the Wolf returns.

With the danger behind her and resolve in her heart, Red pushed open the cottage door, stepping into the safety of home and the promise of a new beginning.
