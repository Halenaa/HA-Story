The mother presses a folded letter into Red's palm, her voice low and urgent: 'Grandmother is worse. Take this medicine, but stay on the main path.' Red nods, adjusting the basket's weight and tightening her grip on the letter. She listens to the distant caw of crows and the soft rustle of wind in the trees as her mother inspects the basket, ensuring the jars of broth and cloth-wrapped bread are secure. Red promises not to stray, but as she steps onto the path, boots crunching over damp gravel as the forest looms ahead, she finds herself tempted by the mysteries the woods hold beyond the main trail. Thoughts of adventure and curiosity whisper through her mind, making her question whether she can truly resist wandering. Red's mother watches from the threshold, her hand lingering on the door, eyes tracking Red until the mist swallows her form, still anxious about her daughter's resolve.",

Red listens as her mother gives several urgent and detailed cautions, extracting a promise from Red that she will not leave the path under any circumstances and will ignore anything attempting to lure her away. With her mother’s words echoing in her mind, Red nods solemnly and steps onto the leaf-carpeted path. Her mother watches, heart heavy with concern, until Red disappears among the trees, then turns back to the cottage, remaining extra vigilant for any unusual sounds from the forest, her anxiety heightened by the seriousness of her warnings.",

Sensing his presence, Red grips her basket tighter and maintains her composure, determined to reach her grandmother safely.

The Wolf's objective is to deceive and overpower Grandmother to set a trap for Red; Grandmother's objective is to defend herself and survive.

Inside, the Wolf, disguised beneath a quilt, stiffens and pulls the covers higher, replying in a raspy imitation, 'Come in, dear.' Red hesitates, glancing at the door's scratched wood, then slowly pushes it open, scanning the dim interior for signs of her grandmother. She edges closer, setting her basket on a wooden stool, her senses alert to the odd silence and the heavy breathing from the bed. As Red approaches, she notices the sharp glint of teeth beneath the quilt and the unnatural size of 'Grandmother's' eyes and hands. Growing increasingly suspicious, Red questions the figure in the bed, pressing for details only her real grandmother would know and refusing to approach despite the Wolf's repeated urgings. The Wolf becomes more insistent, his disguise slipping as Red's interrogation continues. Sensing imminent danger, Red stands her ground, demanding to see 'Grandmother's' hands and challenging the Wolf directly about her grandmother's whereabouts.
