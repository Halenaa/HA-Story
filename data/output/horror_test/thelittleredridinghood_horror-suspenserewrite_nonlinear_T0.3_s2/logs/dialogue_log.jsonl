Red moves toward the bed, setting her basket on the wooden table, glancing around at the unfamiliar, musky scent in the room and the oddly long-fingered hand resting on the quilt.

Red hesitates, scanning the room, but obeys, motivated to care for her grandmother as her mother instructed. The Wolf, intent on his meal, draws her closer, licking his lips as he pats the bed beside him.

Driven by hunger and the memory of Red's words in the woods, he slunk from shadow to shadow, blending with the mottled patterns of sunlight on the ground. Near the cottage, he sniffed the air, catching the scent of baking bread and illness—Grandma's scent, weak but distinct. He circled the cottage, claws scraping softly against the weathered wood as he found a loose window latch. With practiced stealth, he nudged it open, the hinges creaking just loud enough to draw Grandma's attention. Her voice quavered from inside, demanding to know who was there. The Wolf instantly mimicked Red's tone, softening his growl to a girlish pitch, and called, 'It's me, Grandma—Red, I've brought you bread and honey.' His tail flicked with anticipation as he slipped through the window, nose twitching at the mingled aromas of herbs and wool blankets. Grandma, motivated by longing for her granddaughter and trust in her voice, hobbled toward the parlor, unaware of the Wolf's true nature. The Wolf lunged, his movements quick and silent, and forced Grandma into the wardrobe, slamming the door shut and wedging a chair under the handle. Seizing her nightcap and shawl, he donned them, his claws curling awkwardly beneath the soft fabric, and settled under the heavy quilts.

She places a wrapped bundle of bread and a small jar of honey into Red's basket, her hands lingering as she checks the knots. 'Stay to the path, Red.

Rather than immediately focusing on his predatory motives, the Wolf engaged Red in philosophical conversation about solitude, weaving in personal musings about loneliness, regret, and self-discovery. His manner was smooth and inviting, and though he hinted at hunger, he lingered more on the subject of being alone in the woods, perhaps aiming to lower Red's guard through empathetic vulnerability. Red straightened, grip tightening on her basket, recalling her mother’s warnings, but was also drawn to the Wolf's words. She replied, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, just past the brook.' The Wolf continued, 'Alone. The word itself bites colder than the wind...' and shared his reflections, subtly seeking information about Red and her grandmother while appearing introspective. Red, intent on displaying her maturity, answered, 'She lives alone, but I visit her often. I want to show how responsible I am.'
