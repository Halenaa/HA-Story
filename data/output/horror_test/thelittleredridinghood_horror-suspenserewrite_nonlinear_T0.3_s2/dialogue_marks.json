The door opens slowly with a groan. Red steps inside, her boots squeaking on the warped floorboards. She notices 'Grandma' lying in bed, hidden under a thick patchwork quilt, only her face visible in the dim glow of the hearth. The figure beckons her closer, voice raspy—'Come in, dear.' Red moves toward the bed, setting her basket on the wooden table, glancing around at the unfamiliar, musky scent in the room and the oddly long-fingered hand resting on the quilt. The Wolf, disguised as Grandma, keeps his head turned away from the light, pulling the covers higher. He fixes his yellow eyes on Red, urging her to approach—'Let me see you better, child.' Red hesitates, scanning the room, but obeys, motivated to care for her grandmother as her mother instructed. The Wolf, intent on his meal, draws her closer, licking his lips as he pats the bed beside him. The tension between them increases: Red inches forward, the Wolf's tail twitching under the quilt, each maneuvering toward their own goal—Red to tend her ailing grandmother, the Wolf to strike when she is close enough.",

Near the cottage, he sniffed the air, catching the scent of baking bread and illness—Grandma's scent, weak but distinct. He circled the cottage, claws scraping softly against the weathered wood as he found a loose window latch. With practiced stealth, he nudged it open, the hinges creaking just loud enough to draw Grandma's attention. Her voice quavered from inside, demanding to know who was there. The Wolf instantly mimicked Red's tone, softening his growl to a girlish pitch, and called, 'It's me, Grandma—Red, I've brought you bread and honey.' His tail flicked with anticipation as he slipped through the window, nose twitching at the mingled aromas of herbs and wool blankets. Grandma, motivated by longing for her granddaughter and trust in her voice, hobbled toward the parlor, unaware of the Wolf's true nature. The Wolf lunged, his movements quick and silent, and forced Grandma into the wardrobe, slamming the door shut and wedging a chair under the handle. Seizing her nightcap and shawl, he donned them, his claws curling awkwardly beneath the soft fabric, and settled under the heavy quilts. The Wolf's objective—to deceive Red and claim his meal—was now set, his disguise in place as he listened for distant footsteps approaching on the forest path.",
