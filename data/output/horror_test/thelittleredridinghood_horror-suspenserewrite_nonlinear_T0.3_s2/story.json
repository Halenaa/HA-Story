Wind rattles the branches, and bird calls echo faintly. Red approaches the cottage, basket in hand, boots crunching over twigs and slick mud. The cottage windows flicker with dim firelight.",

        "plot": "Red pushes open the creaking gate, feeling the rough wood beneath her palm. She knocks on the cottage door, listening as the wind whistles through the eaves. The door opens slowly with a groan. Red steps inside, her boots squeaking on the warped floorboards. She notices 'Grandma' lying in bed, hidden under a thick patchwork quilt, only her face visible in the dim glow of the hearth. The figure beckons her closer, voice raspy—'Come in, dear.' Red moves toward the bed, setting her basket on the wooden table, glancing around at the unfamiliar, musky scent in the room and the oddly long-fingered hand resting on the quilt. The Wolf, disguised as Grandma, keeps his head turned away from the light, pulling the covers higher. He fixes his yellow eyes on Red, urging her to approach—'Let me see you better, child.' Red hesitates, scanning the room, but obeys, motivated to care for her grandmother as her mother instructed. The Wolf, intent on his meal, draws her closer, licking his lips as he pats the bed beside him. The tension between them increases: Red inches forward, the Wolf's tail twitching under the quilt, each maneuvering toward their own goal—Red to tend her ailing grandmother, the Wolf to strike when she is close enough.",

        "plot": "The Wolf crouched low behind a clump of ferns, ears flicking at the distant caw of a crow. Driven by hunger and the memory of Red's words in the woods, he slunk from shadow to shadow, blending with the mottled patterns of sunlight on the ground. Near the cottage, he sniffed the air, catching the scent of baking bread and illness—Grandma's scent, weak but distinct. He circled the cottage, claws scraping softly against the weathered wood as he found a loose window latch. With practiced stealth, he nudged it open, the hinges creaking just loud enough to draw Grandma's attention. Her voice quavered from inside, demanding to know who was there. The Wolf instantly mimicked Red's tone, softening his growl to a girlish pitch, and called, 'It's me, Grandma—Red, I've brought you bread and honey.' His tail flicked with anticipation as he slipped through the window, nose twitching at the mingled aromas of herbs and wool blankets. Grandma, motivated by longing for her granddaughter and trust in her voice, hobbled toward the parlor, unaware of the Wolf's true nature. The Wolf lunged, his movements quick and silent, and forced Grandma into the wardrobe, slamming the door shut and wedging a chair under the handle. Seizing her nightcap and shawl, he donned them, his claws curling awkwardly beneath the soft fabric, and settled under the heavy quilts. The Wolf's objective—to deceive Red and claim his meal—was now set, his disguise in place as he listened for distant footsteps approaching on the forest path.",

She glances toward the cottage as her mother steps onto the threshold, wiping her flour-dusted hands on her apron. Red's mother crosses the yard with brisk steps, her gaze scanning the forest's dark edge. She places a wrapped bundle of bread and a small jar of honey into Red's basket, her hands lingering as she checks the knots. 'Stay to the path, Red. Don't talk to strangers, and come straight back after seeing your grandmother,' she instructs, her voice low and firm. Red straightens, meeting her mother's eyes, and nods, gripping the basket's handle tighter. Determined to show her independence, Red reassures her mother, 'I remember, Mama. I'll be careful.' As Red steps toward the forest path, her mother gently catches her shoulder, pausing to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Red's ear before releasing her. The sun glimmers through the leaves, and Red sets off, the weight of her mother's warning and her own resolve guiding her first steps into the shadowy woods.",

She knelt to inspect a cluster of wild violets, her fingers brushing the soft petals, when a low rustle in the undergrowth snapped her attention forward. The Wolf emerged, his grey coat mottled with shadows, head lowered in a feigned gesture of curiosity. Motivated by hunger and cunning, the Wolf sniffed the air, stepping deliberately into Red's path. He cocked his head, voice smooth and inviting, 'Good day, little one. Where are you headed so early?' Red straightened, grip tightening on her basket, recalling her mother’s warnings but eager to prove her independence. She replied, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, just past the brook.' The Wolf’s yellow eyes lingered on the basket, then he circled Red with slow, calculated steps, tail swishing through the fallen leaves. Seeking information, he asked, 'Is she far? Alone?' Red, intent on displaying her maturity, answered, 'She lives alone, but I visit her often.' As the Wolf calculated his next move, a cold breeze stirred, carrying the scent of pine and distant smoke. Satisfied with the knowledge gained, the Wolf dipped his head in farewell before slinking away between the trees, leaving Red to resume her journey, though the shadows now seemed thicker along the path.",

Red nodded but glanced toward the twisting trail between the trees, her gaze lingering on the dappled shadows. As her mother closed the gate and turned back to the cottage, Red hesitated, then stepped off the main road onto a narrow deer track, drawn by the sight of wild violets growing in the underbrush. The crunch of twigs under her boots mingled with the distant howl of wind, and Red listened for any sign of movement, alert to the warnings but determined to gather flowers for Grandma. Unseen, the Wolf shifted behind a thicket, nose twitching as he watched the girl stray from safety, his hunger sharpening at her disregard for the rules.",

The Wolf snapped at her, claws scraping the floorboards, intent on cornering her against the cottage wall. At that moment, the door crashed open, the Huntsman bursting in with his axe raised. He surveyed the scene quickly, boots thudding as he crossed the room. With deliberate force, he swung the axe handle at the Wolf's shoulder, driving the beast away from Red. The Wolf snarled, hackles raised, and circled toward the back door, but the Huntsman blocked his path, planting himself firmly between the Wolf and the trembling girl. Red scrambled to her feet, clutching the edge of the table for support, her eyes darting between the Wolf and her unexpected rescuer. The Wolf bared his fangs, lips curled, and growled, 'Foolish human, you cannot guard them forever.' The Huntsman tightened his grip on the axe, stating, 'You'll not harm a soul in this cottage.' Red, regaining her footing, scanned the room for anything she could use to help, her determination to protect her grandmother fueling her actions. The standoff filled the cramped space with the heavy thud of hearts and the scent of fear and sweat. The Wolf, realizing he was outmatched, crouched low and prepared to leap for the open window. The scene ended with the Huntsman stepping forward, forcing the Wolf to make a desperate decision.",

Satisfied that all was calm, she guided Red inside, her arm protective and steady. The comforting scent of warm broth wafted through the doorway, mingling with the chill of the morning air. Together, they crossed the threshold, intent on checking Grandma and securing the house before returning to the village.",
