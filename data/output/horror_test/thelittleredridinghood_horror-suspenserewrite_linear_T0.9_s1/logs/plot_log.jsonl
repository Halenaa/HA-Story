Red's mother hands her a small wicker basket lined with linen, filled with fresh bread and a jar of honey, instructing her to avoid the northern path and keep to the trail. As she presses the knife into Red's palm, her voice is low and urgent: 'The woods are watching. Trust no stranger.' Red pockets the knife, adjusts her cloak, and promises to return by sundown. The cottage door creaks open, letting in a rush of cold, earthy air as Red steps out, glancing back at her mother's watchful eyes before she disappears into the shadowed trees."}}

The stranger tips his hat and addresses Red, inquiring about her destination and commenting on the fullness of her basket. Red hesitates, eyeing the stranger's unusually long fingers and the animalistic glint in his gaze. She answers cautiously, keeping her hand near her knife and subtly shifting her weight to maintain distance. The Wolf leans closer, sniffing the air, and suggests a shortcut through the ferns, his voice silky but edged with hunger. Red declines, insisting she must keep to the path as her mother instructed. The Wolf narrows his eyes, bows mockingly, and vanishes back into the undergrowth, leaving behind a faint, musky animal odor. Red resumes her journey, footsteps quickening, acutely aware of unseen eyes tracking her progress."}}

The Wolf greets Red with a smooth, almost hypnotic voice, asking where she is headed. Red, cautious but determined to protect her grandmother, tightens her grip on the knife and responds that she is visiting family. The Wolf circles Red, sniffing the air and feigning concern about wild animals before slyly suggesting a shortcut. Red declines, recalling her mother's warnings, and steps back toward the main path, her boots squelching in the mud. Sensing her suspicion, The Wolf flashes a toothy grin and vanishes into the trees, leaving Red to hurry down the trail, her senses heightened and her objective clear: reach her grandmother’s cabin safely."}}

Red squints, scanning his face and the room beyond, noting the ashy smell of an unlit hearth and the faint, sour scent of wet fur. The Wolf, voice trembling to mimic the old woman, beckons her inside, urging her to set down her basket. Red edges across the threshold but keeps her hand on the knife, her gaze darting to the unfamiliar, deep scratches on the floorboards. She asks, 'Grandmother, why are your hands so large?' The Wolf responds, curling his fingers around the quilt, 'So I may hold you close, child.' Red edges backward, feigning innocence but calculating her next move, determined to protect her grandmother and herself as she listens for any further sign of danger."}}

The Wolf circles the log, sniffing and growling low in his throat. Red darts from her hiding place, hurling a stone at the Wolf's flank to distract him, then sprints toward the cabin door. The Wolf lunges, swiping at Red's cloak, but she slips inside and bolts the door, panting as she listens to the Wolf's claws scraping at the wood."}}

Red nods, scanning the edge of the forest for movement, and then steps back inside to collect Grandmother's shawl from the rocking chair, careful not to disturb the shattered lamp on the floor.
