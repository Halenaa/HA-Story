The stranger tips his hat and addresses Red, inquiring about her destination and commenting on the fullness of her basket. Red answers cautiously but more openly than before, revealing her purpose and engaging the Wolf in a wary yet extended conversation. The Wolf, intrigued by her candor and boldness, presses her with philosophical and tempting questions about curiosity and straying from the path, suggesting a shortcut through the ferns with increasing insistence. Red repeatedly declines, reinforcing her loyalty to her mother's warnings and her promises, but the exchange becomes lengthier and more nuanced, with both parties testing each other's intentions and trustworthiness. Ultimately, Red remains steadfast, politely but firmly refusing the Wolf's offers, keeping her hand near her knife and her mind alert to the danger, while the Wolf masks his frustration with charm before withdrawing into the undergrowth.

The Wolf greets Red with a smooth, hypnotic voice, engaging her in conversation and repeatedly offering to accompany her or guide her via a shortcut through the birch trail, describing it as safer and more direct.
