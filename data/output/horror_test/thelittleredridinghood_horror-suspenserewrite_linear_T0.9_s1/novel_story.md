# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning

Red sits at the heavy oak table, tying her red cloak under her chin while her mother sharpens a silver knife with measured strokes.

Red tugs the hood forward, her fingers trembling only a little as she watches the edge of the blade catch the morning light. "Is it sharp enough yet, Mother? I want to leave before the sun climbs too high." ——Red

Red's MotherShe tests the knife's edge with her thumb, eyes lingering on Red's anxious hands. "Patience, Red—haste dulls more than blades ever do; remember, the woods watch those who rush." ——Red's Mother

Red squares her shoulders, fingers tightening around the basket's handle as her mother inspects the knife's edge one last time. "Then I’ll let them see I’m not afraid to be watched." ——Red

Red's MotherShe tests the blade’s edge against her thumb, eyes flicking to Red with a worried crease between her brows. "Bravery’s no shield against teeth in the dark, dearest—keep your wits keener than this knife." ——Red's Mother

Red slips the knife into her belt and gathers her cloak tight, eyes fixed on the dim line of forest beyond the window. "I will, Mother—I'll remember your words when the shadows start to move." ——Red

Red's mother hands her a small wicker basket lined with linen, filled with fresh bread and a jar of honey, instructing her to avoid the northern path and keep to the trail.

Red cradles the basket in both hands, glancing nervously toward the shadowy treeline as she prepares to set out. "Thank you, Mother. I promise I'll be careful with the bread and honey—they'll reach Grandma just as you packed them. And don't worry, I'll stay on the main trail, just like you said. I remember what happened last spring when I wandered too close to the north woods." ——Red

Red's MotherShe gently smooths Red's hood and presses the basket into her hands, her gaze lingering with worry. "That's my good girl—your grandmother counts on these comforts, and I count on you to mind my warning about the northern path." ——Red's Mother

As she presses the knife into Red's palm, her voice is low and urgent: 'The woods are watching.

Trust no stranger.

' Red pockets the knife, adjusts her cloak, and promises to return by sundown.

Red slips the knife into her pocket, pulls her red cloak tighter around her shoulders, and meets her mother's anxious gaze with a steady, determined look. "Don't worry, Mother. I promise I'll be back by sundown. I know the path, and I won't stray. I need to do this—Grandmother is counting on me." ——Red

Red's MotherShe gently tugs Red's cloak tighter around her shoulders, her eyes lingering with a mix of worry and pride. "Just remember, Red, the woods can be unforgiving—keep your wits about you and trust no shadow, no matter how familiar." ——Red's Mother

The cottage door creaks open, letting in a rush of cold, earthy air as Red steps out, glancing back at her mother's watchful eyes before she disappears into the shadowed trees.

Red pulls her cloak tighter around her shoulders, offering her mother a reassuring smile before stepping into the chill, her boots sinking softly into the moss at the forest's edge. "I’ll be careful, Mama. I promise. I know the woods better than anyone, and I won’t stray from the path. I have to do this—it’s important." ——Red

Red's MotherShe wraps Red’s cloak tighter around her shoulders, her fingers lingering for a moment before letting go, her eyes shimmering with worry and pride. "I know you’re brave, my love, but even the bravest can stumble—remember, the forest listens, and so should you." ——Red's Mother

# Chapter 2: A Strange Encounter on the Path

Red, gripping her wicker basket and the silver knife hidden in her cloak, steps carefully over tangled roots as she heads toward her grandmother's cabin.

She pauses to listen for movement, alert to her mother's warnings.

Suddenly, a tall stranger emerges from the bracken, his cloak shadowing sharp, yellow eyes.

The stranger tips his hat and addresses Red, inquiring about her destination and commenting on the fullness of her basket.

The Wolf (Stranger)The stranger tips his hat with a sly smile, eyes lingering on the basket before meeting Red’s gaze. "Afternoon, miss. That’s quite the basket you’re carrying—looks heavy for someone so small. Mind if I ask where you’re headed with it?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red shifts the basket to her other arm and offers a polite but cautious smile, glancing briefly at the path behind the Wolf. "Oh, just to my grandmother’s cottage at the edge of the woods—she’s been feeling poorly, so I’m bringing her some treats and tea." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in slightly, eyes glinting with curiosity as he studies Red's expression. "A thoughtful gesture; the woods can be unpredictable, though—do you often make the journey alone?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red tightens her grip on the basket and glances warily at the stranger, taking a small step away. "Yes, I walk this path most days, but Mama always tells me to keep to the trail and not talk to strangers." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, eyes lingering on Red's basket before glancing at the shadowy trees. "Wise advice from your mother—still, not every stranger means harm, though some paths do twist where you least expect." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

RedThe Wolf leans in slightly, his eyes glinting with curiosity as he gestures subtly toward a shadowed fork in the path. "Red, have you ever wondered what lies beyond your usual trail, or do you prefer the comfort of the familiar?" ——Red

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her gaze drifting warily to the dense trees beyond the path. "I think I’d rather stick to what I know—Mama says the woods are full of surprises, and not all of them are kind." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in just a little, his eyes glinting with curiosity, as if inviting her to question her routine. "A sensible choice, Red—yet sometimes the most memorable adventures begin with a single step off the beaten path." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red grips the basket a little tighter, glancing warily at the stranger before edging one cautious foot further down the trail. "Maybe so, but I promised Mama I’d come straight to Grandmother’s and not dawdle; she says promises are meant to be kept." ——Red

Red answers cautiously but more openly than before, revealing her purpose and engaging the Wolf in a wary yet extended conversation.

The Wolf, intrigued by her candor and boldness, presses her with philosophical and tempting questions about curiosity and straying from the path, suggesting a shortcut through the ferns with increasing insistence.

Red's gaze flickers over the Wolf, her fingers brushing the hilt of her knife beneath her cloak. She keeps a careful distance, planting her feet in the soft earth as if ready to move at a moment's notice. "Evening. I don't see many travelers on this path. What brings you out here alone?" ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf offers a slow, disarming smile, hands visible and relaxed, eyes studying Red's stance with quiet interest. "Just passing through, same as you—though I hear the woods hold more secrets than most believe." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red's eyes flicker to the shadows behind the Wolf, her fingers tightening on the hilt of her knife under her cloak. "Secrets often come at a price—one I'm not interested in paying tonight." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)He offers a disarming smile, hands visible, but his eyes linger a moment too long on the basket at her side. "Fair enough—though sometimes, it's the ones who aren't looking for trouble who find it all the same." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red's eyes flicker over the stranger's hands, her fingers flexing near the knife hilt as she takes a careful step back. "Trouble usually gives warning, if you know how to listen for it." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)She narrows her eyes, her grip tightening subtly on the handle of her knife as she studies the stranger's face for any sign of intent. "And sometimes, it comes on padded feet, hoping you won't notice until it's too late." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red's eyes flicker briefly to the Wolf's hands, her grip tightening on the knife's hilt beneath her cloak. "I've learned to notice even the quietest footsteps—and to keep my knife sharp, just in case." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf offers a thin, measured smile, hands visible and empty, eyes watching Red's every move for signs of weakness or trust. "Sharp senses and a sharper blade—seems you know these woods better than most." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red tightens her grip on the knife handle, eyes narrowed as she subtly shifts her stance to keep the stranger in her peripheral vision. "Familiar paths teach hard lessons—I've learned not to trust what moves in the shadows." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)He raises his empty hands slightly in a gesture of peace, his eyes watching Red's every move. "The shadows aren't always what they seem—sometimes they're just travelers trying to find their way." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red's eyes narrow slightly, her grip tightening on her cloak as she subtly angles her body to keep the path behind her clear. "Or sometimes they're hiding something they don't want found." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, voice soft, eyes watching her hands with a flicker of curiosity. "That sounds like someone who's had reason to be wary—are you sure you're not the one with secrets to keep?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red narrows her eyes, fingers tightening subtly around the hilt of her knife as she takes a slow step back, maintaining a careful distance. "Everyone has secrets—mine just aren't for sharing with strangers who linger too long in the dark." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)He offers a faint, almost reassuring smile, but his eyes flicker to her hand on the knife, gauging her resolve. "And yet here we are, both lingering—maybe it's the night that keeps secrets, not us." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red shifts subtly, positioning herself where moonlight catches her features, eyes never leaving the Wolf's silhouette. "Maybe, but I trust the night more than those who hide their faces from it." ——Red

Red repeatedly declines, reinforcing her loyalty to her mother's warnings and her promises, but the exchange becomes lengthier and more nuanced, with both parties testing each other's intentions and trustworthiness.

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in, his eyes gleaming beneath hooded lids. He gestures with a graceful paw toward the tangle of ferns, lips curled in a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. "You know, little one, the path you’re taking is dreadfully dull. Through those ferns—just there—is a secret way, swift and shaded. The forest’s heart beats stronger off the beaten track. Why not let me show you? I’d hate for you to tire yourself out before reaching Grandmother’s." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket a bit tighter, glancing at the tangled ferns with a flicker of doubt before looking back at the Wolf, trying to sound braver than she feels. "Thank you, sir, but Mama says to keep to the main path—she says shortcuts can be tricky in these woods." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, a glint of promise in his eyes, and gestures invitingly toward the shadowy ferns. "Ah, but your mother's warnings are for those who wander alone—lucky for you, you have me to guide you, and I know every secret the forest keeps." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red grips her basket a little tighter, glancing at the dark ferns with a flicker of uncertainty in her eyes. "I appreciate your offer, but Mama also says strangers can be tricky too, even if they sound friendly." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf flashes a slow, toothy smile, inching closer as his tail brushes softly through the ferns, eyes fixed on Red with unsettling intent. "Oh, but surely I’m no stranger now—see how we’re already talking like old friends, and friends look out for each other, don’t they?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, taking a small step back while glancing toward the sunlit path ahead. "Maybe, but friends earn trust with time—and Mama says hurrying is how you miss what matters most." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, flashing a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes, his shadow stretching long across the mossy ground. "Ah, but time slips away in these woods, little one, and sometimes what matters most is reaching your destination safely—let me help you, just this once." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket tighter, glancing sideways at the dense undergrowth, her feet planted firmly on the trail. "I’m not sure, sir—the ferns look dark, and I promised Mama I’d bring her wildflowers from the sunny path." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting as he gestures invitingly toward the shadowed ferns, his smile stretched just a bit too wide. "But just think, little blossom—deeper in the shade, rarer blooms grow, ones your mother has never seen, waiting for a clever girl who dares to trust a friend." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, edging away from the tangled ferns, her gaze flicking uncertainly between the Wolf and the dappled main path. "Maybe, but Mama says the brightest flowers don't grow where it's cold and hidden—and I promised I'd pick only what the sun can see." ——Red

Ultimately, Red remains steadfast, politely but firmly refusing the Wolf's offers, keeping her hand near her knife and her mind alert to the danger, while the Wolf masks his frustration with charm before withdrawing into the undergrowth.

Red grips her basket a little tighter and glances warily at the Wolf, taking a careful step forward along the narrow trail. "Thank you, but I really can't. My mother told me to stay on the path and not talk to strangers. It's important that I listen to her." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting with sly curiosity as he steps just a little closer, his tone gentle but coaxing. "Ah, such a dutiful daughter—though sometimes the woods hold more wonders than a well-trodden path ever could." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red tightens her grip on her basket and glances warily at the shadows between the trees. "Maybe so, but my mother says the woods can be dangerous if you're not careful, and I promised her I wouldn't wander." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in slightly, his voice low and inviting, eyes glinting with a hint of mischief. "Of course, but even the most careful travelers sometimes miss what lies just beyond their sight—are you never curious what secrets the forest keeps from the path?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red grips her basket a little tighter and glances warily at the trees beyond the path, her resolve firm. "Curiosity is tempting, but I gave my word, and I'd rather be safe than sorry." ——Red

Red resumes her journey, footsteps quickening, acutely aware of unseen eyes tracking her progress.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Wolf’s Deception

Red walks a narrow, muddy path, clutching her basket and the silver knife her mother gave her.

She pauses by a fallen log, scanning the underbrush for movement.

Suddenly, The Wolf, disguised as a hunched, cloaked traveler, emerges from the thicket and blocks her way, his eyes glinting.

The Wolf greets Red with a smooth, hypnotic voice, engaging her in conversation and repeatedly offering to accompany her or guide her via a shortcut through the birch trail, describing it as safer and more direct.

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf steps from behind a twisted tree, his eyes glinting, voice velvet-smooth and inviting, as he offers a slow, courteous bow to Red. "Well now, such a lovely day for a walk, isn't it? All alone in the woods, just you and your basket. Tell me, little one—where might you be headed on this fine morning?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing toward the winding path ahead. "I'm just visiting my grandmother; she lives in a cottage at the edge of these woods." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in just a touch closer, his smile widening as his eyes flicker with interest. "Ah, how devoted you are—such a sweet granddaughter, venturing so far; does your dear grandmother know how brave you are to stroll these shadowed paths alone?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red tightens her grip on the basket and glances down the path, her voice steady but her eyes searching the stranger's face for any sign of trouble. "Oh, she worries sometimes, but I know these woods well—and I promised to be quick." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in ever so slightly, his gaze lingering on Red's basket as a sly smile tugs at the corners of his mouth. "But even the cleverest traveler can lose their way when the forest whispers secrets—are you sure you won't let me walk with you, just to be safe?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red grips her basket a little tighter and glances down the winding trail, her voice polite but with a hint of nervousness. "Thank you, but I wouldn't want to trouble you—Grandmother says it's best to walk alone and keep to the path." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf steps a little closer, his eyes glinting as he offers a courteous, almost too-smooth smile. "Ah, but sometimes the path twists when you least expect it—perhaps a stranger's company is a comfort, not a trouble." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her gaze flickering to the trees as if searching for familiar landmarks. "I appreciate your kindness, but Grandmother always says strangers may have secrets hidden beneath their smiles." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in slightly, his eyes glinting with an unsettling curiosity as he flashes a disarming smile. "Secrets, my dear, are simply stories waiting to be told—perhaps you and I could share a few before your journey’s end." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red grips her basket a little tighter, taking a cautious step back as she glances down the path toward her grandmother's cottage. "Maybe another time—Grandmother will be expecting me soon, and she says stories are best saved for when everyone is safe and warm inside." ——Red

Red, though tempted and momentarily considering his suggestion, ultimately recalls her mother's warnings, expresses doubt about the shortcut, and firmly declines to leave the main path despite The Wolf's persistent persuasion.

Red keeps the knife hidden in her cloak, her knuckles white around the handle. She stands tall, voice steady, but her eyes never leave the Stranger's face, watching for any sign of danger. "I'm just on my way to see my grandmother. She lives at the end of the lane. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really should be going." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf steps from the shadows, his eyes glinting as he blocks a portion of the path, forcing Red to slow her pace. "The forest can be dangerous for a girl alone—are you sure you know the way?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red shifts her stance, keeping the knife hidden but ready, her eyes never leaving the Wolf's face. "I know these woods better than anyone, and I don't need help finding my way." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, eyes flickering with interest as he steps just close enough for Red to notice the tension in his posture. "Ah, but even those who know the path can stumble when something unexpected crosses it." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red narrows her eyes, shifting her stance protectively, the knife held steady at her side as she studies the stranger's face for any sign of danger. "Thank you for your concern, but I've learned to watch for things that lurk where they shouldn't be." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, eyes narrowing as he steps just slightly closer, his gaze lingering on the knife in Red's hand. "A wise lesson—though sometimes what lurks is simply curious who else walks these woods so late." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red narrows her eyes, shifting her stance to keep the knife visible as she subtly steps between the Wolf and the faint trail leading to her grandmother’s cottage. "Curiosity isn’t always harmless, and I’d rather not find out which kind you are." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf's eyes narrow, flickering with an unreadable glint as he steps just close enough to test Red's resolve. "Perhaps, but sometimes curiosity keeps one alive—especially when the woods hide more than shadows." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red narrows her eyes, taking a cautious step back while keeping the knife visible at her side. "Then it’s best we both mind our own paths, before curiosity leads us somewhere we can’t return from." ——Red

The Wolf tries several times to convince her, but Red remains cautious and polite, refusing to trust a stranger and making it clear she will stick to her mother's advice.

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf paces a slow, gentle circle around Red, ears pricked in feigned alertness, casting glances into the dark trees as if searching for hidden threats. "My, my, what a lonely path you walk, dear child. The woods can be frightful for someone so young—have you heard the growls in the shadows? I would hate for anything to happen to you. Why, if it were me, I'd take the little trail through the birches just ahead. It's much quicker, and far safer, I assure you." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red peers down the birch-lined trail, clutching her basket a little tighter, her eyes wide with curiosity and a hint of caution. "Oh, thank you for your concern, sir—I hadn't noticed that path before; do you really think it's safer than the usual road?" ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in, lowering his voice conspiratorially, and gestures invitingly toward the narrow birch-lined path. "But of course, little one—the usual road is full of twists where wolves may lurk unseen, while the birch trail keeps everything in plain sight." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red pauses, glancing uncertainly down the suggested path, clutching her basket a little tighter. "That does sound reassuring, but Grandmother always tells me to stay on the main road—are you quite sure the birch trail leads to her cottage?" ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf leans in closer, his voice smooth and low, gesturing invitingly toward the pale trunks of the birch trees. "Why, I pass by your grandmother's cottage often, and I can promise you—the birch trail brings you straight to her door, with hardly a shadow to trouble you." ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red glances down the birch trail, hesitating, then steps closer to its entrance, peering curiously between the pale trunks. "Well, if you’re certain it’s safe and leads to Grandmother, perhaps I’ll try your shortcut just this once." ——Red

Sensing he cannot sway her, The Wolf flashes a toothy grin and vanishes into the trees, leaving Red to hurry down the main trail, her senses heightened and her objective clear: reach her grandmother’s cabin safely.

Red shakes her head firmly and steps away, her boots squelching in the mud as she puts more distance between herself and the Wolf. "No, thank you. My mother always said to keep to the main path and not talk with strangers." ——Red

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf tilts his head, his smile widening as he takes a slow, deliberate step closer, eyes gleaming with sly curiosity. "Ah, but sometimes the most interesting things lie just beyond the main path, Little Red—are you sure you want to miss out?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red takes another cautious step away, clutching her basket tighter as she glances warily at the Wolf. "I'm sure—my mother warned me about veering off, and I trust her more than curiosity." ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Red’s Suspicious Arrival

Red approaches the weather-beaten door of her grandmother's cabin, her boots squelching in the mud as she steps carefully around tangled roots.

She pauses, gripping the silver knife concealed in her cloak, and knocks three times, her knuckles scraping the rough wood.

The door creaks open, revealing the Wolf disguised as Grandmother;

his eyes glint oddly in the fading light.

Red squints, scanning his face and the room beyond, noting the ashy smell of an unlit hearth and the faint, sour scent of wet fur.

The Wolf, voice trembling to mimic the old woman, beckons her inside, urging her to set down her basket.

The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers, tries to steady his voice, but it quivers with an uneasy tremor as he gestures weakly toward the bedside, urging Little Red Riding Hood to step deeper into the dim room. "Oh, my dear. come closer, won't you? Set your basket down by the bed, child. My eyes aren't what they used to be." ——The Wolf

Red edges across the threshold but keeps her hand on the knife, her gaze darting to the unfamiliar, deep scratches on the floorboards.

She asks, 'Grandmother, why are your hands so large?

' The Wolf responds, curling his fingers around the quilt, 'So I may hold you close, child.

' Red edges backward, feigning innocence but calculating her next move, determined to protect her grandmother and herself as she listens for any further sign of danger.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: The Attack and Escape

Red crouches behind a fallen log, clutching her silver knife as she scans the shadowy forest for movement.

The Wolf, disguised as a weary traveler, stalks closer to the cabin, nose twitching to catch Red's scent.

Red quietly snaps a twig under her boot, drawing the Wolf's attention.

The Wolf circles the log, sniffing and growling low in his throat.

Red darts from her hiding place, hurling a stone at the Wolf's flank to distract him, then sprints toward the cabin door.

The Wolf lunges, swiping at Red's cloak, but she slips inside and bolts the door, panting as she listens to the Wolf's claws scraping at the wood.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Rescue and Confrontation

Red enters the cabin, clutching her silver knife, her boots leaving muddy prints on the threshold.

She immediately notices Grandmother's empty chair and the faint, musky scent lingering in the room.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, reclines on the bed, eyeing Red with predatory intent.

Red edges closer, scanning the room for signs of her grandmother.

The Wolf, voice low and silky, beckons Red to approach, urging, 'Come closer, child, so I may see you better.

' Red, motivated by her mother's warnings and her desire to protect her grandmother, grips the knife tighter and asks probing questions, trying to expose the Wolf's deception.

Red stands at the foot of the bed, her knuckles white around the handle of the knife hidden behind her back. Her gaze darts from the wolf's snout to the oddly large eyes staring back at her, suspicion flickering across her face as she inches closer, careful and alert. "Grandmother, why are your eyes so much bigger today? And your voice. it sounds strange, almost like someone else's. Did something happen while I was away?" ——Red

The Wolf shifts on the mattress, claws hidden beneath the covers, and tries to lure Red nearer, intent on attacking.

The Wolf (Stranger)The Wolf props himself up slightly on the bed, voice softened to a gentle croon, one paw slipping beneath the quilt as he watches Red's every move, eyes glittering with a hunger he carefully masks behind a frail smile. "Come closer, dear child. My eyes aren't as sharp as they once were, and I long to see your sweet face in the morning light. Tell me, what brings you so early to your grandmother's side?" ——The Wolf (Stranger)

Red stalls, backing toward the fireplace, her eyes darting for any sign of her grandmother or escape.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: Aftermath and a New Warning

Red stands beside her mother just beyond Grandmother's porch, clutching the silver knife that still bears a faint streak of blood.

Red's Mother kneels to inspect the deep claw marks gouged into the wooden doorframe, then runs her hand along the damp wood to check its strength.

She glances at Red and briskly pulls her cloak tighter around her shoulders.

'We cannot linger here,' she says, voice low, as she surveys the shadows beneath the trees.

Red nods, scanning the edge of the forest for movement, and then steps back inside to collect Grandmother's shawl from the rocking chair, careful not to disturb the shattered lamp on the floor.

Together, they quickly gather scattered food and supplies, Red's Mother pressing a bundle into Red's arms.

As they prepare to leave, Red's Mother warns, 'The wolf will return.

You must always carry the knife.

' Red tucks the knife into her belt and secures her basket, determination in her grip as they lock the cabin door and move toward the path leading home.
