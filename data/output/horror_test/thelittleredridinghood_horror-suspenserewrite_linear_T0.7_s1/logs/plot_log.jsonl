She glances toward the window, her hands steady as she fastens the lid and tucks in a jar of honey. Red, wrapped in her scarlet cloak, paces by the door, her boots scuffing the worn floorboards as she peers eagerly outside. Mother wipes her hands on her apron and steps between Red and the exit, placing the basket firmly in Red's arms. She fixes Red with a serious stare and says, 'Stay on the path, and don't talk to anyone you meet in the woods. There have been strange tracks—keep your wits about you.' Red nods impatiently, adjusting the heavy basket in her grasp and glancing toward the forest's shadowy edge. Despite Mother's warning, Red's fingers tighten on the basket as she steps past her mother, determined to prove she can make the journey alone and help her ailing grandmother. Mother lingers at the door, watching Red disappear into the mist, then bolts the door behind her, scanning the tree line for movement."}}

Suddenly, Red halts at a fork, hesitating. The Wolf emerges, brushing leaves from his fur, and addresses her in a gravelly, oddly polite voice: 'Lost, little one? The woods twist for those who hurry.' Red grips her basket tighter, replying, 'I know these woods. I’m just visiting my grandmother.' The Wolf tilts his head, feigning innocence, and asks, 'Such a caring granddaughter. Perhaps I can show you a quicker way?' Red, eager but wary, shakes her head and steps away, determined to prove her independence, while the Wolf lopes into the trees, plotting his approach.

The Wolf, eyes glinting, blocks the way and tilts his head. He proposes a riddle, promising to let Red pass if she answers correctly. Red, stubborn and curious, pauses, brushes mud from her cloak, and listens as The Wolf recites his riddle with deliberate pauses: 'What has teeth but cannot bite?' Red frowns, tapping her chin, and guesses 'a comb.' The Wolf grins, pretends to be impressed, then slyly offers a second riddle, inching closer and sniffing the basket. Red, motivated by urgency, answers quickly, but The Wolf maneuvers to distract her further, intent on learning the cottage's location. Red, frustrated but determined to protect her grandmother, refuses to reveal more and tries to sidestep the Wolf, but he blocks her again, pressing for answers.

Inside, Grandmother frowns, her frail hands gripping the quilt as she listens to the odd cadence in the voice. Sensing danger, she rises unsteadily and secures the latch, her breath rattling. The Wolf, impatient, presses his weight against the door, making the hinges groan. Grandmother grabs her walking stick and knocks it against the floor, calling out, 'Who’s there? State your name!' The Wolf, frustrated but determined, feigns a cough and croons, 'It’s your granddaughter, come to help.' As Grandmother hesitates, debating whether to unlock the door, the Wolf crouches low, ears flat, eyes fixed on the window, searching for another way inside.

Red sets the basket on the table, her eyes narrowing as she studies the unfamiliar shape beneath the blanket. She steps closer and asks, 'Grandmother, is that you? Your voice sounds strange.' The Wolf responds in a low, gruff tone, 'Come closer, child, so I may see you better.' Red hesitates, scanning the dim room and noticing muddy paw prints on the floorboards.

Driven by suspicion, Red asks pointedly about the Wolf's strange features, circling the bed and edging closer to the fireplace poker. The Wolf, motivated by hunger and the thrill of deception, answers with sly, rhythmic speech, his eyes following Red's every move.
