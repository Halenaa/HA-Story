She glances toward the window, her hands steady as she fastens the lid and tucks in a jar of honey. Red, wrapped in her scarlet cloak, paces by the door, her boots scuffing the worn floorboards as she peers eagerly outside. Red asserts her independence, responding to Mother's concerns by insisting she is capable of making the journey alone and that Grandmother needs her help. Mother, visibly anxious, wipes her hands on her apron and steps between Red and the exit, placing the basket firmly in Red's arms. She fixes Red with a serious stare and says, 'Promise me you'll stay on the path and come straight home after?' She adds further warnings about the mist and the dangers lurking in the woods, wishing Red had waited until daylight. Red nods impatiently, adjusting the heavy basket in her grasp and glancing toward the forest's shadowy edge, determined to prove herself. Mother lingers at the door, watching Red disappear into the mist, then bolts the door behind her, scanning the tree line for movement.",

Red promises not only to be quick, but also demonstrates awareness of potential dangers in the woods, referencing her knowledge of what lurks there. Mother releases her grip, reassured by Red’s determination and caution, then double-checks the locked cottage door and scans the treeline for movement, her worry lingering but assuaged by Red’s readiness.

Behind a thick stand of ferns, The Wolf crouches low, nose twitching as he follows the scent of bread and herbs. He pads silently from shadow to shadow, sharp eyes tracking Red’s every footstep. Suddenly, Red halts at a fork, hesitating. The Wolf emerges, brushing leaves from his fur, and addresses her in a gravelly, oddly polite voice: 'Lost, little one? The woods twist for those who hurry.' Red grips her basket tighter, replying that she knows these woods and is visiting her grandmother, but the conversation shifts as the Wolf claims to have seen her grandmother recently, telling Red she is tired and wishes not to be disturbed. Red is suspicious but is coaxed into a longer conversation in which the Wolf presses for details about her routine, her grandmother’s habits, and the safety of her visits. Red reveals she is usually the only visitor and her visits are routine. The Wolf feigns concern and tries to persuade Red to let him check on the grandmother first, but Red insists on going herself. The Wolf, seeing Red’s stubbornness, offers a shortcut again, but Red remains wary. The Wolf circles ahead, intent on reaching the cottage before Red, armed with new information about her habits and their vulnerability.",

The Wolf also claims to have already seen the grandmother, which is new and increases his deception. Red is more trusting and open than in the original plot, sharing information and considering the Wolf's suggestions, though she ultimately maintains her independence by insisting on checking on her grandmother herself. The plot has been updated to include this extended interaction and the Wolf gathering information for his scheme."

She halts as a low growl emerges from the underbrush, and The Wolf steps into her path, tail swishing and nose twitching at the scent of bread and herbs. The Wolf, eyes glinting, blocks the way and tilts his head. He proposes a riddle, promising to let Red pass if she answers correctly. Red, stubborn and curious, pauses, brushes mud from her cloak, and listens as The Wolf recites his riddle with deliberate pauses: 'What has teeth but cannot bite?' Red frowns, tapping her chin, and guesses 'a comb.' The Wolf grins, pretends to be impressed, then slyly offers a second riddle, inching closer and sniffing the basket. Red, motivated by urgency, engages in a wary, verbally sparring exchange with The Wolf, refusing to reveal the true contents or her purpose. The Wolf maneuvers to distract her further, intent on learning the cottage's location. In this tense verbal duel, Red, while maintaining her defensive stance, inadvertently reveals some details about her route—namely, that she takes the main path and turns left at the willow tree—under pressure from the Wolf's probing questions. Realizing the Wolf's manipulations, Red, frustrated but determined to protect her grandmother, refuses to say more and insists on passing. The Wolf continues to press, questioning her motives and trying to undermine her confidence, but Red stands her ground, declaring her loyalty and independence. Eventually, Red darts past him, cloak snagging on a branch, while The Wolf lopes after her, now armed with clues about her path deeper into the woods.",

With a low growl, the Wolf raps sharply at the door, voice pitched high to mimic Red’s, calling, 'Grandmother, it’s me—Red, with your soup.' Inside, Grandmother frowns, her frail hands gripping the quilt as she listens to the odd cadence in the voice. Sensing danger, she rises unsteadily and secures the latch, her breath rattling. The Wolf, impatient, presses his weight against the door, making the hinges groan. Grandmother grabs her walking stick and knocks it against the floor, calling out, 'Who’s there? State your name!' However, instead of remaining silent or evasive, Grandmother decides to assert herself further. She raises her voice, challenging the intruder, 'Well now, child, you know me—I'm your Grandmother, Margaret Whitaker. There's no need for such harshness in your voice. But if you must ask, perhaps it's because these days, trust is in short supply—even among family.' The Wolf, momentarily thrown by Grandmother's boldness, hastily feigns a cough and croons, 'Ahem—ahem! Grandmother, it’s me, your little granddaughter. I’m here to help you, just like always. Would you let me in, please?' As Grandmother hesitates, debating whether to unlock the door, the Wolf crouches low, ears flat, eyes fixed on the window, searching for another way inside.

Red sets the basket on the table, her eyes narrowing as she studies the unfamiliar shape beneath the blanket. She steps closer and, in an attempt to maintain normalcy and perhaps mask her own suspicion, she playfully mimics a sore throat, saying her voice is off today. The Wolf, seizing this opportunity, encourages her to come closer with soothing words, reassuring her and urging her to approach the bed.
