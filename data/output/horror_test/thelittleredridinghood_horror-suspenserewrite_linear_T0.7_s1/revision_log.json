Red verbally asserts her independence, which aligns with her character motivation but was previously only shown through actions. The updated plot incorporates Red’s verbal insistence and expands Mother’s warnings to match the dialogue.",

        "plot_change_note": "Red’s dialogue explicitly indicates her awareness of dangers in the woods, which is more cautious than the original plot’s emphasis on her impulsiveness and focus solely on speed and independence. The updated plot reflects Red’s heightened vigilance and knowledge of threats, making her departure more deliberate and informed.",

The Wolf manipulates Red into sharing details about her grandmother, their routines, and her own safety, rather than simply offering a shortcut and moving on. The Wolf also claims to have already seen the grandmother, which is new and increases his deception. Red is more trusting and open than in the original plot, sharing information and considering the Wolf's suggestions, though she ultimately maintains her independence by insisting on checking on her grandmother herself. The plot has been updated to include this extended interaction and the Wolf gathering information for his scheme.",

To align with the dialogue, the updated plot reflects Red revealing some directions under pressure, yet still protecting the core secret. The Wolf's interrogation is also more persistent and psychological in the dialogue than the original summary.",

This requires updating the plot so that Red, perhaps to deflect suspicion or maintain calm, pretends she is the one with a sore throat. This better aligns the plot with the presented dialogue and maintains character logic.",
