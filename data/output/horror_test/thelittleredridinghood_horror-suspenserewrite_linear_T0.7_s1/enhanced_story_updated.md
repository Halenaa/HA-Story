# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Basket and Warning

Mother stands by the hearth, ladling steaming broth into a covered basket lined with a checkered cloth.

She glances toward the window, her hands steady as she fastens the lid and tucks in a jar of honey.

Red, wrapped in her scarlet cloak, paces by the door, her boots scuffing the worn floorboards as she peers eagerly outside.

Red asserts her independence, responding to Mother's concerns by insisting she is capable of making the journey alone and that Grandmother needs her help.

Mother, visibly anxious, wipes her hands on her apron and steps between Red and the exit, placing the basket firmly in Red's arms.

She fixes Red with a serious stare and says, 'Promise me you'll stay on the path and come straight home after?

' She adds further warnings about the mist and the dangers lurking in the woods, wishing Red had waited until daylight.

Red nods impatiently, adjusting the heavy basket in her grasp and glancing toward the forest's shadowy edge, determined to prove herself.

Red lifts her chin, clutching the basket tightly as she steps toward the door, her eyes shining with resolve despite the tremor in her voice. "I know you’re worried, Mother, but I’m not a child anymore. I can take the path to Grandmother’s house on my own. She needs me—and I want to help her." ——Red

Mother's hands hover at Red's shoulder, her eyes searching Red's face for reassurance even as she tries to let go. "Oh, Red, I only worry because the woods are full of shadows and not every creature means you well—promise me you'll stay on the path and come straight home after?" ——Mother

Mother lingers at the door, watching Red disappear into the mist, then bolts the door behind her, scanning the tree line for movement.

Mother presses her trembling hand to the window pane, eyes searching the shifting fog for any sign of movement, her breath quickening with each passing moment. "Oh, Red. please be careful out there. That mist hides more than shadows." ——Mother

Mother presses her hand to the door, her breath shallow, eyes flickering between the silent trees and the thickening mist. "If only you'd waited for daylight, child—there are things in those woods that no lantern can keep at bay." ——Mother

----------------------------------------

With her mother’s warnings echoing in her mind, Red stepped beyond the threshold and into the chill of the morning mist, the weight of the basket grounding her resolve. The narrow trail ahead seemed to blur at its edges, the world hushed except for the distant call of crows and the soft crunch of leaves beneath her boots. Each step carried her farther from the safety of home and deeper into the uncertain hush of the forest, where every shadow seemed to watch and every breeze whispered of secrets yet to unfold. As she pressed on, Red’s thoughts wandered uneasily between her grandmother’s illness and the stories that haunted these woods—until a sudden rustle up ahead drew her to a cautious halt.

# Chapter 2: Entering the Woods and Meeting the Huntsman

Red, wrapped in her red cloak and clutching a wicker basket, prepares to enter the forest path.

Her mother grabs her shoulder, reties the loose knot of Red’s cloak, and hands her a linen-wrapped bundle of herbs, reminding her to deliver them directly to Grandmother and avoid lingering.

Red promises not only to be quick, but also demonstrates awareness of potential dangers in the woods, referencing her knowledge of what lurks there.

Mother reties the knot on the linen bundle, tucking it securely into Red’s basket, then presses the basket into Red’s hands with gentle insistence, her eyes full of concern. "Here, Red—take this bundle of herbs for your grandmother. The chill in the air is sharp today, and she’ll need them for her cough. Go straight there and don’t dawdle on the path, do you hear me? I worry for you in this cold, and it’s best not to linger." ——Mother

Red tucks the linen bundle carefully into her basket, glancing up with determination before stepping toward the door. "I promise, Mother—I’ll walk quickly and bring the herbs straight to Grandmother, without stopping." ——Red

Mother releases her grip, reassured by Red’s determination and caution, then double-checks the locked cottage door and scans the treeline for movement, her worry lingering but assuaged by Red’s readiness.

Red glances nervously toward the tangled shadows, clutching her basket a little tighter. She takes a steadying breath and steps forward, determination flickering in her eyes. "I’ll be fast—I promise. The woods are darker than they look, and I know what’s out there." ——Red

Red, motivated by concern both for her grandmother and her family’s safety, sets out with resolve and alertness into the shadowy woods.

----------------------------------------

With the huntsman’s warning echoing in her mind, Red presses on, her footsteps quickening as she leaves the safety of the main path behind. The trees crowd closer, branches whispering overhead, and every rustle in the undergrowth reminds her of the unseen dangers lurking in the gloom. Unbeknownst to her, as she navigates the twisting shortcut, watchful eyes are already tracking her every move, drawn by the promise of an unsuspecting traveler venturing too deep into the heart of the woods.

# Chapter 3: Red’s Shortcut and the Wolf’s Stalking

Red clutches her wicker basket, weaving briskly between brambles as she mutters directions under her breath, determined to reach her grandmother faster by taking the overgrown shortcut.

Behind a thick stand of ferns, The Wolf crouches low, nose twitching as he follows the scent of bread and herbs.

He pads silently from shadow to shadow, sharp eyes tracking Red’s every footstep.

Suddenly, Red halts at a fork, hesitating.

The Wolf emerges, brushing leaves from his fur, and addresses her in a gravelly, oddly polite voice: 'Lost, little one?

The Wolf emerges from the shadowy undergrowth, brushing leaves from his coarse fur. His yellow eyes linger on her, head tilted in apparent curiosity, though his lips curl in a faint, unsettling smile. "Lost, little one? The woods can be unkind to those who wander too far from the path." ——The Wolf

The woods twist for those who hurry.

The Wolf's eyes glint in the dim light, his voice low and steady as he steps closer, blocking the narrow path with his presence. "Do you, little one? The woods have a way of changing when you think you know them best. Every shadow keeps a secret." ——The Wolf

Red meets the Wolf's gaze, her voice steady, though her fingers tremble around the basket handle. "If secrets are hiding, they've always kept quiet for me." ——Red

The Wolf circles a fallen branch, his eyes glinting as he draws a step closer, lowering his tone to a velvet hush. "Perhaps they've only been waiting for the right voice to coax them out." ——The Wolf

Red lifts her chin, eyes steady on the Wolf, even as the wind rustles the leaves overhead. "Then let them listen well—I don't scare easily, and I don't lose my way." ——Red

The Wolf circles closer, eyes glinting beneath the tangled branches. "Bravery is admirable, but even the sure-footed can stumble when the path decides to shift beneath them." ——The Wolf

' Red grips her basket tighter, replying that she knows these woods and is visiting her grandmother, but the conversation shifts as the Wolf claims to have seen her grandmother recently, telling Red she is tired and wishes not to be disturbed.

Red clutches her basket a little tighter and peers into the dim light of the cottage, her voice warm but edged with a flicker of uncertainty as she glances at the figure in the bed. "Oh, I always come by to check on her, especially when she’s not feeling well. She says my visits cheer her up. Have you seen her today?" ——Red

The Wolf smiles thinly, his eyes glinting as he watches Red for any sign of suspicion. "Why, yes, I saw her just a little while ago—she seemed quite tired and asked me to let her rest undisturbed for now." ——The Wolf

Red shifts her basket nervously from one arm to the other, glancing toward the cottage door with concern. "That's strange—she usually loves company, even when she's tired; are you sure she wanted to be left alone?" ——Red

The Wolf offers a reassuring smile but glances toward the closed bedroom door, subtly positioning himself between Red and the entrance. "Well, you know how the elderly can be—sometimes their moods change quickly; perhaps she just needed a moment of peace before seeing you." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the doorway, clutching her basket tighter as she eyes the Wolf with uncertainty. "I suppose that makes sense, but I brought her some fresh bread and honey—maybe I'll just peek in quietly so I don't disturb her." ——Red

The Wolf pats the edge of the bed invitingly, his eyes glinting as he watches Red hesitate at the doorway. "Oh, but wouldn't it be a shame to wake her if she's finally managed to fall asleep? Why not sit with me for a moment and tell me more about your grandmother's favorite treats—perhaps I could help make her more comfortable." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the doorway, clutching her basket a little tighter, her curiosity and concern warring with her mother's advice. "Well, she does love stories while she eats—sometimes I tell her about my walk through the woods, although Mama warned me not to talk to strangers along the way." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, his eyes glinting with curiosity as he gestures invitingly to the seat beside him. "Oh, but surely I'm no stranger if I'm here looking after your dear grandmother—why don't you tell me what else she enjoys, so I can be certain she gets only the best care?" ——The Wolf

Red hesitates near the door, glancing uncertainly between the Wolf and the silent room beyond, clutching her basket a little tighter. "I suppose that's true—she likes wildflowers by her bedside and warm milk at night; you must be very thoughtful if you're helping her rest." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, his eyes glinting with curiosity as he tries to gather more about Grandmother's habits. "Indeed, I only wish to make her as comfortable as possible—tell me, does she often have visitors, or are you usually the only one to come by?" ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing toward the bedroom door with a hint of uncertainty. "It's mostly just me—Mama says it's safer that way, since the woods can be dangerous for strangers." ——Red

The WolfHe subtly shifts closer, casting a shadow over Red's basket as if sizing up its contents. "The Wolf smiles thinly, his gaze lingering on Red a moment too long—'Such devotion; your grandmother is very fortunate to have you all to herself.'" ——The Wolf

RedShe hesitates at the threshold, peering past the Wolf toward the shadowed bedroom, a flicker of doubt crossing her face as the Wolf steps subtly between her and the door. "Red smiles uncertainly, clutching her basket a little tighter—'Thank you, I just want her to be safe and happy, that's all.'" ——Red

The WolfRed hesitates, glancing toward the bedroom door, her fingers fidgeting nervously with the handle of her basket. "The Wolf leans in ever so slightly, his voice soft and coaxing—'And you always come at the same time, don't you? That way your grandmother knows exactly when to expect you.'" ——The Wolf

Red glances toward the cottage door, her grip on the basket tightening as unease flickers across her face. "Yes, I always come in the afternoon so she doesn't worry—it's our little routine." ——Red

The WolfHe folds his paws neatly, masking his anticipation as he watches Red for any sign of suspicion. "The Wolf's grin widens, his eyes glinting with a hidden hunger—'How thoughtful; routines do make it easy to look after those we care about, don't they?'" ——The Wolf

RedShe shifts her weight anxiously, debating whether to trust the Wolf or check on her grandmother herself. "Red nods, glancing toward the bedroom door—'I just hope she's really resting and not feeling worse than usual.'" ——Red

The WolfHe rises smoothly, blocking Red's view of the bedroom as he gestures invitingly, his posture both reassuring and subtly obstructive. "The Wolf tilts his head, voice silky—'Perhaps you should let me check on her first, just to be certain she's well enough for visitors.'" ——The Wolf

RedShe takes a tentative step toward the bedroom door, her wary eyes flicking from the Wolf to the quiet room beyond. "Red hesitates, her grip tightening on the basket—'Thank you, but I think I'd feel better if I checked on her myself, just for a moment.'" ——Red

The WolfHe steps subtly between Red and the door, his shadow falling across the threshold as he gestures for her to wait. "The Wolf's eyes narrow, his tone honeyed but insistent—'Of course, but do be careful not to startle her; after all, sudden surprises can be so. unsettling.'" ——The Wolf

RedShe inches closer to the bedroom, her eyes flickering uncertainly between the Wolf and the threshold, tension mounting in the small, shadowed room. "Red glances nervously at the Wolf, her voice wavering as she steps toward the door—'I'll be very quiet, I promise.'" ——Red

Red is suspicious but is coaxed into a longer conversation in which the Wolf presses for details about her routine, her grandmother’s habits, and the safety of her visits.

The Wolf steps closer, his eyes glinting with sly confidence, gesturing invitingly toward a shadowy trail that disappears into the thicket. "Perhaps I can show you a quicker way? The woods are full of winding paths, but I know shortcuts others wouldn't dare take. Trust me—if you want to reach your destination before nightfall, my route is your best chance." ——The Wolf

Red reveals she is usually the only visitor and her visits are routine.

The Wolf feigns concern and tries to persuade Red to let him check on the grandmother first, but Red insists on going herself.

The Wolf, seeing Red’s stubbornness, offers a shortcut again, but Red remains wary.

The Wolf circles ahead, intent on reaching the cottage before Red, armed with new information about her habits and their vulnerability.

----------------------------------------

As Red presses on through the tangled shortcut, the woods seem to close in around her, every snapping twig and shifting shadow heightening her unease. Meanwhile, the wolf, now armed with knowledge of Red’s routine and her grandmother’s frailty, slips silently ahead, intent on reaching the cottage first. Yet, as Red approaches a fork in the path, she finds the wolf waiting, no longer hiding but eager to engage her in a new way—one that promises confusion and delay. With the cottage drawing near, a cunning challenge emerges, setting the stage for a dangerous game of wits between girl and predator.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Tricks Red with a Riddle

Red, gripping the basket tight and stepping over slick roots, quickens her pace toward Grandmother's cottage.

She halts as a low growl emerges from the underbrush, and The Wolf steps into her path, tail swishing and nose twitching at the scent of bread and herbs.

The Wolf, eyes glinting, blocks the way and tilts his head.

He proposes a riddle, promising to let Red pass if she answers correctly.

The Wolf narrows his eyes, blocking Red's path and awaiting her reply. "Well now, little Red, here are the rules: answer my riddle and you may walk freely, but fail—well, let's just say your journey ends here; do you accept my challenge?" ——The Wolf

Red stands tall, determination flickering in her eyes as she grips her basket tightly. "If it's the only way through these woods, then I accept your challenge, Wolf." ——Red

The Wolf circles Red slowly, his eyes gleaming as he prepares to speak the riddle. "Very well, Red—listen closely, for the stakes are your freedom and your fate." ——The Wolf

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes gleaming, as the forest seems to hush in anticipation. "The riddle I pose is one that has tangled many minds before you, so prepare yourself, Red." ——The Wolf

The Wolf circles Red slowly, his eyes glinting with anticipation, savoring the tension in the air. "Should you answer incorrectly, I won't be so merciful as to let you wander back the way you came." ——The Wolf

The Wolf leans in, his golden eyes gleaming, as the forest around them falls eerily silent. "Now, steady your nerves and sharpen your wits, for once the riddle is spoken, there will be no turning back." ——The Wolf

The Wolf leans forward, eyes gleaming, lips curled in a sly smile, awaiting Red's final confirmation. "Are you certain you're ready, Red, for the path ahead vanishes if my riddle defeats you?" ——The Wolf

Red squares her shoulders and meets the Wolf's eyes, determination flickering in her gaze. "I'm ready, Wolf—ask your riddle, and let's see whose wits are sharper tonight." ——Red

Red, stubborn and curious, pauses, brushes mud from her cloak, and listens as The Wolf recites his riddle with deliberate pauses: 'What has teeth but cannot bite?

Red narrows her eyes, clutching her basket a little tighter. She takes a cautious step back, glancing at the shadows flickering behind the Wolf, her voice trembling with a mix of challenge and uncertainty. "Teeth, but no bite? Is this some kind of game to you, Wolf? Or are you just trying to scare me?" ——Red

The Wolf circles closer, eyes glinting, his voice low and measured, watching Red's reaction intently. "Games and fear are cousins, Red—sometimes, the prize is knowing who walks away hungry." ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, fingers tightening around the basket's handle as she leans forward, voice steady but trembling at the edges. "If it's a prize you want, Wolf, then tell me—what do I lose if I answer wrong?" ——Red

The Wolf's eyes glint in the dusky light, his voice curling around the words like a promise and a warning. "Your path, Red—every step you take from here could belong to me." ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, tightening her grip on the basket, her voice steady but her heart pounding as she stands her ground. "Then I suppose I'd better choose my steps—and my answers—carefully, if I don't want to end up lost to you." ——Red

The Wolf's eyes glint as he circles, his voice a low rumble that trembles the air between them. "But we both know, Red, that it's not the teeth you should fear—it's what waits in the shadows behind the grin." ——The Wolf

' Red frowns, tapping her chin, and guesses 'a comb.

Red frowns, tapping her chin thoughtfully as she voices her uncertain guess. "Hmm. is it. a comb?" ——Red

' The Wolf grins, pretends to be impressed, then slyly offers a second riddle, inching closer and sniffing the basket.

The Wolf grins, exposing sharp teeth beneath his lips as he edges closer, nostrils flaring, sniffing the air above Red's basket. His eyes flicker with sly amusement, but there's a predatory glint beneath the charm. "My, my, what a clever little thing you are, Red. I must say, your answer has left me quite. ravenous for more. But tell me, can your wits keep pace with a second challenge? Or are you only clever with words, and not with secrets?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, taking a small step back as the Wolf leans in, eyes glinting with cunning curiosity. "Secrets are best kept in the right company, Mr. Wolf, but I suppose I can play along—if you promise to keep your snout out of my basket." ——Red

The Wolf leans in, nostrils flaring as he inhales deeply near Red’s basket, his gaze flickering between her face and the bundle she clutches. "Oh, but secrets have a scent all their own, and my snout can’t help but follow where temptation leads—now, for your second riddle: What lies beneath the skin, yet hides from the eye, growing stronger with every lie?" ——The Wolf

Red grips the basket tighter, eyes narrowing as the Wolf's nose hovers dangerously close, her voice steady but her stance shifting subtly backward. "If it's truth you seek, Mr. Wolf, you'll find my basket holds none for you—perhaps it's the heart that swells with secrets best left unspoken?" ——Red

The Wolf leans in, nostrils flaring as he inhales the basket's aroma, his shadow stretching over Red's shoes. "Ah, the heart—so delicate, so easily bruised, yet your answer reveals more than you intend, Red." ——The Wolf

Red grips the basket tighter, taking a subtle step back while eyeing the Wolf's creeping advance. "Careful, Mr. Wolf—sometimes a bruised heart is sharper than teeth." ——Red

The Wolf grins wider, inching even closer, nostrils flaring as he inhales the basket’s scent, his gaze lingering on Red with hungry calculation. "Sharp words from a sharper tongue—yet I wonder, Red, does your basket hide more than your heart dares reveal?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, edging it protectively behind her as she locks eyes with the Wolf, her stance unyielding despite his looming presence. "Maybe it does, but you'll have to mind your step—some secrets bite back harder than wolves." ——Red

The Wolf edges even closer, nostrils flaring as he inhales the basket's scent, his gaze lingering hungrily on Red's guarded arms. "Now, now, no need for bared teeth—I'd never bite the hand that feeds me riddles, but curiosity does make a wolf bold." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, eyes never leaving the Wolf as she takes a careful step back, her posture wary but unyielding. "And boldness, Mr. Wolf, can be a dangerous game to play when you don't know what's lurking at the bottom of the basket." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, nostrils flaring as he takes a slow, deliberate sniff, his yellow eyes glinting with sly intent. "Then perhaps it's time I discover if your basket's secrets taste as sweet as your riddles, Red." ——The Wolf

Red shifts the basket protectively to her other arm, her eyes narrowing as she plants her feet, watching the Wolf inch forward with a cautious defiance. "Step any closer and you might just find the bottom of this basket isn't as empty as you hope, Mr. Wolf." ——Red

Red, motivated by urgency, engages in a wary, verbally sparring exchange with The Wolf, refusing to reveal the true contents or her purpose.

Red clutches the basket tightly, glancing down the path with anxious impatience, eager to continue on her way. "I really can't stay and chat—Grandmother's expecting me, and I promised to deliver this basket before midday." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, voice gentle and curious, blocking Red's path ever so slightly with his large paw. "Of course, dear child, but surely your grandmother wouldn't mind if you told me—just briefly—how you find your way through such a tangled forest; is it a winding path, or do you take the old stone bridge?" ——The Wolf

Red shifts her weight anxiously, gripping the basket tighter and glancing toward the path, her feet already edging away from the Wolf. "It's really quite simple—I just follow the main path straight ahead, but I truly must hurry before the sun climbs too high." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, feigning innocent curiosity while edging closer to Red, eyes glinting with sly intent. "Ah, but isn't there a fork just past the old willow tree, dear—do you turn left toward the clearing, or right where the wildflowers bloom?" ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket tighter and steps anxiously toward the path, glancing over her shoulder with impatience. "Oh, it's left at the willow—easy to remember—but please, I can't delay any longer!" ——Red

The Wolf maneuvers to distract her further, intent on learning the cottage's location.

Red tightens her grip on her basket, her jaw set. She tries to step around the Wolf, eyes narrowed, refusing to meet his gaze, her body tense with both fear and resolve. "I told you, I'm just out for a walk—and that's all you need to know. Now, please let me through. My grandmother is waiting for me, and I'm not about to let anyone or anything get in my way." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, blocking the narrow path with his hulking frame, his eyes narrowing with growing suspicion as he studies Red's determined face. "Ah, but it seems to me you're hiding something far more interesting than a simple basket of bread—why so defensive, Red?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket and squares her shoulders, standing her ground as her eyes flash with resolve. "Whatever you think you know, it's none of your business—move aside, or I'll find another path." ——Red

The Wolf narrows his eyes and steps closer, blocking the path entirely, his tone sharpening as suspicion mounts. "Really now, Red? You expect me to believe you're risking these dark woods for mere bread and tea—what are you truly carrying that's worth defying a wolf?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket and squares her shoulders, her eyes blazing with determination as she steps forward, refusing to back down. "Believe what you want, but I won't let you intimidate me into betraying my grandmother—she trusts me, and I won't fail her." ——Red

The Wolf narrows his eyes, stepping closer to block the narrow path, his voice low and insistent. "Trust is a fragile thing, Red—are you sure your secrets won't shatter it?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, eyes flashing with defiance as she edges sideways, searching for any gap past the Wolf. "My secrets are mine to keep, and nothing you say will shake my loyalty to her." ——Red

The Wolf leans in closer, his eyes narrowing as he circles Red, blocking her path more aggressively. "Loyalty, hmm? But loyalty can be blinding—what if your devotion leads you both into danger?" ——The Wolf

Red stands her ground, fists clenched at her sides, her eyes locked defiantly on the Wolf as she refuses to step back. "Danger finds those who go looking for it, and I won't be lured off my path by your games." ——Red

In this tense verbal duel, Red, while maintaining her defensive stance, inadvertently reveals some details about her route—namely, that she takes the main path and turns left at the willow tree—under pressure from the Wolf's probing questions.

Realizing the Wolf's manipulations, Red, frustrated but determined to protect her grandmother, refuses to say more and insists on passing.

The Wolf continues to press, questioning her motives and trying to undermine her confidence, but Red stands her ground, declaring her loyalty and independence.

Eventually, Red darts past him, cloak snagging on a branch, while The Wolf lopes after her, now armed with clues about her path deeper into the woods.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, the wolf, now privy to her destination and route, wastes no time in slipping through the trees, driven by cunning intent. As Red navigates the tangled path, reassured by her own resolve, the wolf takes a swifter, unseen shortcut through the shadows of the forest. While Red believes herself to be one step ahead, a more perilous game is already unfolding at the edge of her grandmother's cottage.

# Chapter 5: Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House First

The Wolf pads silently through the underbrush, nose twitching at the lingering aroma of stew drifting from Grandmother’s chimney.

Driven by hunger and cunning, he circles the cottage, claws scraping against the bark as he peers through the window to spot Grandmother resting in bed.

With a low growl, the Wolf raps sharply at the door, voice pitched high to mimic Red’s, calling, 'Grandmother, it’s me—Red, with your soup.

The Wolf stands close to the door, claws hidden behind a checked basket, voice raised to a sweet, wavering pitch. His ears strain for any sound from within, every muscle tensed in anticipation. "Grandmother, it’s me—Red, with your soup. Let me in, I’ve brought your favorite!" ——The Wolf

' Inside, Grandmother frowns, her frail hands gripping the quilt as she listens to the odd cadence in the voice.

Sensing danger, she rises unsteadily and secures the latch, her breath rattling.

The Wolf, impatient, presses his weight against the door, making the hinges groan.

Grandmother grabs her walking stick and knocks it against the floor, calling out, 'Who’s there?

Grandmother grips her walking stick tightly, her eyes narrowing as she peers into the shadows, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and determination. "Who’s there? Show yourself now! Don’t think you can sneak up on me in my own house!" ——Grandmother

State your name!

GrandmotherShe clutches her shawl a little tighter, her eyes searching the shadows for the face that demanded her name, a flicker of hurt and worry passing across her features. "Well now, child, you know me—I'm your Grandmother, Margaret Whitaker. There's no need for such harshness in your voice. But if you must ask, perhaps it's because these days, trust is in short supply—even among family." ——Grandmother

' However, instead of remaining silent or evasive, Grandmother decides to assert herself further.

The Wolf clears his throat, pressing his snout closer to the door, striving to soften his gruff voice. His paw trembles with impatience as he struggles to mimic the granddaughter’s tone, forcing a sweet, wavering lilt into every word. "Ahem—ahem! Grandmother, it’s me, your little granddaughter. I’m here to help you, just like always. Would you let me in, please?" ——The Wolf

She raises her voice, challenging the intruder, 'Well now, child, you know me—I'm your Grandmother, Margaret Whitaker.

There's no need for such harshness in your voice.

But if you must ask, perhaps it's because these days, trust is in short supply—even among family.

' The Wolf, momentarily thrown by Grandmother's boldness, hastily feigns a cough and croons, 'Ahem—ahem!

Grandmother, it’s me, your little granddaughter.

I’m here to help you, just like always.

Would you let me in, please?

' As Grandmother hesitates, debating whether to unlock the door, the Wolf crouches low, ears flat, eyes fixed on the window, searching for another way inside.

The wind stirs the leaves as both predator and prey make their decisions—one to invade, the other to defend.

----------------------------------------

Meanwhile, as the wolf settles into his disguise and the house grows eerily quiet, the distant sound of footsteps approaches along the forest path. The wolf positions himself, every muscle tensed, while shadows lengthen across the parlor. Unaware of the danger awaiting her, Red draws closer to the cottage, basket in hand, already sensing that something about this afternoon is not as it should be.

# Chapter 6: Red Arrives and Senses Something Wrong

Red clutches her wicker basket and knocks sharply on the weathered cottage door, listening as the hinges creak open.

Peering inside, she notices the fire is burning low and the air feels unusually still, with no sound of Grandmother's usual humming.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, lies stiffly in bed and quietly sniffs the air, watching Red's every movement.

Red sets the basket on the table, her eyes narrowing as she studies the unfamiliar shape beneath the blanket.

She steps closer and, in an attempt to maintain normalcy and perhaps mask her own suspicion, she playfully mimics a sore throat, saying her voice is off today.

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tightly, her gaze flickering nervously between the figure under the covers and the familiar room. "Grandmother? You seem. different. Why are your eyes so big? And your voice—it's not quite the same. Are you feeling alright?" ——Red

The Wolf, seizing this opportunity, encourages her to come closer with soothing words, reassuring her and urging her to approach the bed.

Red gives a sheepish smile and sips from a mug of tea. "Oh, you noticed? Yeah, my voice is a bit off today—I’ve got a sore throat. I promise I’m not coming down with anything serious, just one of those days where my vocal cords are staging a protest." ——Red

Red, motivated by her desire to help Grandmother, prove her independence, and now to maintain the ruse, hesitates before inching forward, trying to spot anything else unusual while gripping her basket tightly.

The Wolf leans forward slightly, his gaze fixed on the child, a predatory glint lurking behind his feigned concern. "Come closer, child, so I may see you better. The shadows are deep in this room, and my old eyes struggle to make out your sweet face." ——The Wolf

The Wolf lifts a clawed hand, beckoning gently, his gaze fixed hungrily on the child. "Don't be afraid, little one—the closer you are, the better I can ensure you are safe from the cold and darkness." ——The Wolf

The Wolf pats the edge of the bed with a clawed hand, motioning for the child to approach. "Let me hear your gentle voice, child—lean in and tell your dear grandmother how your journey through the woods has fared." ——The Wolf

The Wolf pats the bed beside him with a paw, his eyes glinting hungrily in the dim light. "The night air clings to you, my dear; come nearer and let me wrap you in this warm blanket, so no harm may befall you." ——The Wolf

The Wolf licks his lips, ready to spring if she gets close enough.

----------------------------------------

Red hesitates at the threshold, her instincts screaming that something is terribly amiss. The urgency of her mission wars with her growing fear, each detail in the room reinforcing her suspicion. As she edges closer, tension coils in her chest—she knows she must deliver the medicine, but every step brings her face-to-face with her unease. The flicker of movement beneath the blanket and the hungry gleam in the wolf’s eyes push her to the brink, forcing Red to make a choice: trust her senses or ignore them. What happens next will demand all her courage.

# Chapter 7: Red Confronts the Wolf and Fights Back

Red enters her grandmother's cottage, suspicious of her grandmother's strange appearance.

She questions her 'grandmother' about her eyes, voice, hands, and teeth, pressing for answers.

Instead of answering directly as in the original plot, the Wolf responds with playful, rhyming speech, attempting to distract and further engage Red in conversation by probing her about her own journey and secrets.

The Wolf, still motivated by deception and hunger, tries to draw out Red's story and delay being discovered.

Red edges closer to the bed, her gaze darting between the Wolf's face and the fireplace poker, fingers trembling as she brushes against its handle. "Grandmother, why are your eyes so. large? And your voice—it's different. You sound. hoarse. Are you feeling alright?" ——Red

Red tightens her grip on the cold iron poker, her gaze flickering nervously between the Wolf and the shadows dancing on the walls. "And your hands—why are they so big and rough?" ——Red

Red edges closer to the fireplace, her eyes darting between the Wolf's mouth and the iron poker within arm's reach. "And your teeth, Grandmother—why are they so sharp?" ——Red

Red remains wary and continues to question her 'grandmother,' but the Wolf's tactic is to deflect suspicion through conversation rather than immediately answer with sly explanations.

The Wolf's tongue flicks over his teeth as he circles a tree, his gaze never leaving Red, his steps silent but deliberate in the dappled shade. "Ah, what a curious girl, skipping through the wood—
With a basket full of treats, just as sweet as she could.
Tell me, dear Red, where does your journey go,
And what secrets do you carry, beneath that crimson bow?" ——The Wolf

The tension rises as Red becomes more suspicious, setting the stage for her moving closer to a weapon, preparing for confrontation.

----------------------------------------

As Red’s cries echo through the cottage and out into the forest, the chaos inside is matched only by the desperate pounding of her heart. The wounded wolf, now enraged and cornered, prepares for a final attack just as distant footsteps thunder down the path—her plea for help has not gone unheard. The approaching presence signals that the struggle between Red and the wolf is far from over, setting the stage for an encounter that will decide both their fates.

# Chapter 8: The Huntsman’s Rescue and Final Showdown

Red, gripping her empty basket in one hand, pushes open the creaking cottage door, her boots scraping against the rough wooden floor.

She spots the Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, crouched on the bed and baring its yellowed teeth.

The Wolf lunges, claws raking the air, while Red snatches up a nearby iron poker, swinging it defensively.

Outside, the Huntsman, drawn by Red's frantic shouts and the sound of breaking glass, bursts through the window, splinters flying.

Red scrambles away from the shattered window, clutching her torn cloak, eyes wide with terror as she gestures desperately toward the door. "Huntsman! Over here—please, help me! She's coming back, I can't get out!" ——Red

The Huntsman lands heavily among the shattered glass, axe raised, scanning the shadows for any sign of the Witch. "Stay behind me, Red—I'll keep you safe!" ——The Huntsman

He raises his axe, shouting a warning, and advances on the Wolf, forcing it away from Red.

The HuntsmanHe steps between Red and the Wolf, gripping his axe tightly and fixing the Wolf with a steely glare, his voice ringing with command. "Stay back, beast! You’ll not harm her while I draw breath." ——The Huntsman

The WolfRed scrambles backward, clutching her cloak, eyes wide with terror as the Huntsman steps between her and the Wolf. "The Wolf bares its fangs, hackles raised, and snarls, 'You think your blade frightens me, mortal? She was mine first.'" ——The Wolf

Red retreats a step, half-hidden by the Huntsman's broad shoulders, trembling but watching the Wolf's every move. "Red gasps, clutching her cloak tighter as she inches behind the Huntsman, her eyes wide with terror and hope." ——Red

The HuntsmanHe plants his feet firmly between Red and the Wolf, muscles tense, unwavering in his defense. "The Huntsman levels his axe, voice steady but fierce: 'Step away, Wolf, or face the edge—her life is not yours to claim.'" ——The Huntsman

The WolfRed trembles, watching the Wolf's eyes flicker between her and the Huntsman, desperation tightening her grip on his arm. "The Wolf crouches low, muscles tensed, voice rumbling with dark promise: 'You cannot protect her forever—my hunger is patient.'" ——The Wolf

RedShe clings to the Huntsman's cloak, her knuckles white, heart pounding in her chest as the Wolf's eyes lock on hers. "Red's voice trembles as she peeks from behind the Huntsman: 'Please—don't let him take me.'" ——Red

The HuntsmanHe plants his feet firmly, gripping his axe with both hands, preparing for any sudden move the Wolf might make. "The Huntsman glances back at Red, his tone resolute: 'Trust me, I won't let him near you.'" ——The Huntsman

The Wolf circles warily, muscles coiled, testing for weakness as the Huntsman shifts to keep himself between Red and the looming predator. "The Wolf growls, eyes glinting with malice: 'Then prepare to bleed for her, woodsman.'" ——The Wolf

The Huntsman tightens his grip on the axe, planting his feet firmly between Red and the advancing Wolf, ready for the inevitable clash. "Steel yourself, Wolf—I've felled greater beasts than you, and I will not falter now." ——The Huntsman

The WolfRed recoils, a cry escaping her lips as she clings to the Huntsman's arm, while the Huntsman braces himself, feet planted, axe raised defensively. "The Wolf lunges forward, snapping jaws inches from the Huntsman's axe, voice savage: 'We'll see whose blood stains the snow tonight.'" ——The Wolf

The HuntsmanHe steps firmly between Red and the Wolf, boots crunching in the snow, every muscle taut and ready for the Wolf's next attack. "The Huntsman swings his axe in a wide, warning arc, voice ringing with command: 'You'll find no easy prey here—back down, or face your end!'" ——The Huntsman

The WolfSnow scatters as the Wolf paces in a tense circle, circling both Red and the Huntsman, claws digging deep into the frozen earth. "The Wolf recoils, lips curling in a snarl, but its eyes remain locked on Red: 'She will cry your name as you fail her.'" ——The Wolf

Red clutches the Huntsman's coat, her fear mingling with a newfound courage as she stands her ground. "Red's breath catches, but she draws herself up behind the Huntsman, voice quivering yet defiant: 'He won't fail me—I'm not afraid of you!'" ——Red

The WolfHe plants himself firmly between Red and the Wolf, muscles coiled, eyes never leaving the beast. "The Huntsman tightens his grip on the axe, voice low and unwavering: 'If you come for her, you'll answer to me first.'" ——The Wolf

The WolfSnow crunches beneath its paws as it prowls, trying to find an opening past the Huntsman's steadfast defense. "The Wolf circles, never breaking eye contact, voice dripping with menace: 'Bravery is wasted on doomed hearts.'" ——The Wolf

The HuntsmanHe raises his axe higher, muscles taut, ready to strike as the Wolf hesitates, hackles bristling. "The Huntsman steps forward, planting himself firmly between Red and the Wolf, voice cold as steel: 'Then let your doom begin with me.'" ——The Huntsman

The Wolf circles, hackles raised, but the Huntsman maneuvers between Red and the predator, his stance firm and deliberate.

As the Wolf attempts to dart past him toward the door, the Huntsman swings his axe, driving the Wolf back toward the hearth.

The objective is to protect Red and subdue the Wolf;

the outcome is that the Wolf is cornered, Red is shielded behind the Huntsman, and the standoff sets the stage for the final confrontation.

----------------------------------------

As the dust settles and the echoes of the struggle fade, the battered silence in the cottage reveals the cost of their ordeal. With the Wolf defeated and the immediate danger gone, Red and her grandmother are left to reckon with what has transpired, each marked by the events in their own way. The huntsman, weary but resolute, offers comfort, yet it is Red who feels the weight of change pressing upon her. In the hush that follows, new questions arise—about safety, courage, and the choices that will shape Red’s path forward.

# Chapter 9: Aftermath and Red’s New Resolve

Red stands at the table, carefully tying her red cloak with trembling hands as she eyes the wicker basket full of bread and herbs.

Mother briskly ladles steaming tonic into a cup, her gaze flickering to Red’s preparations.

She sets the cup down with a firm clink and blocks the door, voice low and steady: 'You will stay within sight of the path, Red, and you will not stray, do you understand?

Mother steps closer, her hand tightening around the handle of the teapot, eyes never leaving Red’s face as she waits for an answer. "There are things in those woods that you cannot outrun, Red. The path is the only place you are safe. Promise me you will not wander." ——Mother

Red glances toward the window, fingers twisting in her cloak, curiosity flickering behind her cautious tone. "I promise, Mother—but what if something calls from the shadows?" ——Red

Mother's hand tightens on Red's shoulder, her gaze unwavering and fierce. "If something calls, you keep your eyes forward and your feet moving—nothing in those woods means you well, Red." ——Mother

' Red nods, her jaw set, and grabs the basket tightly.

As she moves toward the door, Mother’s anxiety surfaces more openly.

She implores Red not only to stay on the path, but to promise she will call for help if anything strange happens, her voice trembling with memories of past dangers: 'Promise me you'll call for help if you see anything strange, anything at all.

Mother grips Red's wrist tightly, her eyes wide and voice trembling with worry. "Red, wait—please. Just. promise me you'll call for help if you see anything strange, anything at all. I need to hear you say it. After everything that's happened, I can't let you go without that promise." ——Mother

Red squeezes her mother's hand gently, trying to offer a reassuring smile despite the worry in her own eyes. "Okay, Mama, I promise—I’ll call for help if anything seems wrong, I swear." ——Red

I need to hear you say it.

After everything that's happened, I can't let you go without that promise.

' Red, sensing the gravity of her mother's worry, hesitates but finally says, 'Okay, Mama, I promise—I’ll call for help if anything seems wrong, I swear.

' With a final look of resolve, Red steps outside into the crisp air, the promise of dew clinging to her feet.

----------------------------------------

The path stretched ahead, dappled with morning light, and as Red walked forward, her heart carried both the weight of promises and the quiet strength to keep them.
