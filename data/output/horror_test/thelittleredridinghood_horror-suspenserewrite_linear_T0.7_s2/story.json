Red stands near the weathered wooden gate of her cottage, clutching a small satchel of medicine. Her mother fastens Red's crimson cloak, hands trembling slightly as she ties the knot.",

She closes the flap and presses it into Red’s hands, voice low but urgent: 'Do not stray from the path. The woods are dangerous, Red, and that wolf is still out there.' Red tugs the cloak tighter, jaw set, and nods as she slips the strap over her shoulder. She glances toward the treeline, the soft crunch of her boots in the gravel as she steps forward, intent on reaching Grandmother’s cottage before dusk. Red’s mother steps into her path, placing a firm hand on Red’s shoulder and meeting her gaze. 'Promise me,' she insists. Red hesitates, then promises, eager to prove she can face the woods alone. Red’s mother finally releases her, watching as Red heads down the mossy path, the sound of her footsteps fading into the quiet, damp air.",

Her mother steps in front of her, blocking the path with outstretched arms and a stern look. She inspects Red's cloak for tears, checks the basket, and presses a scrap of dried meat into Red's palm for the journey. Red shifts impatiently, glancing toward the shadowy undergrowth, and says, 'I can find the path myself, Mother. I won't stray.' Her mother replies, voice low and urgent, 'Stay to the trail. Don't speak to anyone you don't know. And if you hear howling, run.' After a final hug, Red steps forward into the woods as her mother watches, arms crossed, until Red disappears among the trees. The scene closes with Red's determined footsteps crunching over fallen leaves, and her mother's worried gaze lingering at the forest's edge.",

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from behind a gnarled tree, its fur bristling and yellow eyes locked on Red. The Wolf circles, its claws digging into the soft mud, and sniffs the air, intent on catching Red's scent. Red backs away, keeping her basket close, and calls out, 'Stay back! I'm just passing through.' The Wolf lowers its head, lips curling, and responds with a guttural growl, 'Little one, the woods are not safe for stray lambs.' Red glances at a nearby fallen branch and, driven by her determination to reach her grandmother, grabs it and brandishes it in warning. The Wolf lunges, snapping its jaws inches from Red's cloak, but Red swings the branch, striking The Wolf's snout. The Wolf recoils, growling, and disappears behind a thicket, leaving Red shaken but determined to hurry onward. The encounter forces Red to decide to take a less-traveled shortcut, hoping to avoid further danger and reach her grandmother before sunset.",

She knocks twice on the crooked door, the sound echoing inside. As she waits, a low growl emanates from the thicket; The Wolf's shadow stretches across the clearing. Driven by hunger and cunning, The Wolf circles the cottage, its paws sinking into the damp soil, eyes locked on Red. Red scans the tree line, her breath quickening, then calls out, 'Grandmother, are you there?' The Wolf, voice gravelly and mocking, responds from behind a fallen log, 'She won't answer you, little one.' Red's grip tightens on her satchel as she backs toward the door, determined to reach her grandmother and deliver the medicine. The Wolf prowls closer, hackles raised, ready to block her path.",

She sets it on the scarred table and scans the dim room, her eyes narrowing at the sight of 'Grandmother' tucked beneath a patchwork quilt. The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightcap, turns its snout slightly, keeping most of its face hidden. Red edges closer, wrinkling her nose at the musky, unfamiliar scent in the air. She leans in, studying the sharp glint of teeth barely concealed by the quilt. Red asks, 'Grandmother, why are your eyes so big?' The Wolf, voice thick and gravelly, replies, 'To see you better, dear.' Red hesitates but inches forward, her hand gripping the medicine bottle tightly. The Wolf's paw twitches beneath the covers, claws scraping softly against the bedframe. Red, suspecting danger, inches backward toward the hearth, her gaze never leaving the figure in bed. The Wolf unfurls a paw, attempting to seize her, but Red ducks and snatches a cast-iron poker from beside the fireplace. The Wolf, frustrated, rises halfway from the bed, quilt falling to reveal its furred haunches. Red shouts, 'Stay back!' as she brandishes the poker, backing toward the open door.",

Red freezes, gripping the basket tighter and glancing over her shoulder for escape. The Wolf pads closer, its tongue flicking and nostrils flaring as it sniffs for the scent of food. Before The Wolf can lunge, twigs snap behind them; The Huntsman steps into the clearing, boots crunching on wet leaves, crossbow raised. He calls out in a gravelly voice, 'Step back, beast. You’ll find no easy meal here.' The Wolf snarls, circles once, then slinks into the underbrush, yellow eyes glaring. The Huntsman lowers his weapon, nods curtly to Red, and gestures for her to follow the safe route. Red obeys, her steps hurried and purposeful, basket swinging as she moves. The encounter ends with Red and The Huntsman striding toward the distant cottage, the wolf’s presence lingering in the hushed woods.",

Red, heart pounding, raises her walking stick and swings it at the Wolf, striking his muzzle. The Wolf snaps at her, teeth flashing, but a sharp report cracks through the air—a warning shot from the Huntsman, who strides out from the treeline with rifle raised and voice hard: 'Step back, beast.' The Wolf snarls, circling, but the Huntsman advances, boots crushing ferns, forcing the predator to retreat into the dark thicket. Red rushes to the door, throwing it open to reach her grandmother inside. The Wolf, thwarted and hungry, melts into the shadows, eyeing the humans with cold calculation. Red slams the door shut, breath ragged, as the Huntsman stands guard outside, scanning the woods for any sign of renewed attack.",
