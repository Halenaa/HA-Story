# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Dire Warning

Red’s mother anxiously checks the satchel, her warnings more urgent and emotional than ever.

She repeatedly stresses the dangers of the woods, insisting that Red must trust her and not stray from the path, emphasizing the presence of sinister forces beyond the wolf and forbidding Red from entering the woods alone after dark.

Red's MotherShe closes the flap tightly and presses it into Red’s hands, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding, her grip firm and unyielding. "Red, listen to me—promise you’ll remember what I’ve said. The woods are not safe, not tonight. Whatever you hear, whatever you see, do not stray from the path. There are things out there that wait for those who wander." ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe grips Red's shoulders gently but firmly, eyes searching hers for understanding. "You must trust me, child—there are shadows in those trees that know your name." ——Red's Mother

Red, feeling the weight of her mother’s concern, acknowledges the fear and doubt others have about her bravery.

Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, her eyes full of concern. "Red, please listen to me—the woods are dangerous, and that wolf is still out there. I don't want you wandering off the path, do you understand? Promise me you'll stay where it's safe." ——Red's Mother

Red's Mother gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, looking into her eyes with concern. "And remember, if you see or hear anything strange, come straight home and don't talk to strangers—especially not wolves." ——Red's Mother

She responds not just with a nod but with a spoken promise of determination, vowing aloud to make it through and prove herself, despite lingering uncertainty.

The exchange concludes with Red’s mother making Red swear never to go into the woods alone after dark, and Red, resolute yet contemplative, sets out toward Grandmother’s cottage, her promise echoing in her mind as she steps into the dusk-shadowed forest.

# Chapter 2: Entering the Forbidden Woods

Red stands at the forest's edge, clutching a small basket of medicine, her fingers curled tightly around the handle.

Her mother steps in front of her, blocking the path with outstretched arms and a stern look.

She inspects Red's cloak for tears, checks the basket, and presses a scrap of dried meat into Red's palm for the journey.

Red shifts impatiently, glancing toward the shadowy undergrowth, and protests, 'You don't have to hover behind every tree like I'm still a child.

Red crosses her arms, her gaze fixed on the thick shadows beyond the brambles. She shifts her weight, tapping her foot impatiently, but her jaw is set with stubborn determination. "I can find the path myself, Mother. You don't have to hover behind every tree like I'm still a child. Honestly, it's just a little woods—hardly the dark, twisted forest you warned me about. I know the way. I remember every step from last time. You always act like something's lurking out here, but maybe you just don't trust me to walk alone." ——Red

I know the way.

Red stands firm, meeting the unseen challenge head-on, voice steady with conviction. "No matter what happens, I won't stray. You can count on that. Even if things get tough, my path is set—and I won't let anything pull me off course." ——Red

You always act like something's lurking out here, but maybe you just don't trust me to walk alone.

Red's MotherShe grips Red’s shoulders, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding, her voice trembling with both fear and love. "Red, listen to me—don’t stray from the path, no matter what. The woods are not safe, and there are things out there that you can’t see, things that don’t wish you well. Promise me you’ll stay to the trail." ——Red's Mother

' Despite her frustration, Red assures her mother, 'No matter what happens, I won't stray.

Red's Mother looks at Red seriously, placing her hands gently on Red's shoulders to emphasize the importance of her words. "Red, before you go out, remember what I've always told you: don't speak to anyone you don't know. There are dangers in the world, and not everyone has good intentions. Promise me you'll be careful and keep to yourself." ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe places her hands gently on Red's shoulders, looking her in the eyes to emphasize the seriousness of her warning. "If anyone tries to talk to you, just politely walk away and come straight home, understand?" ——Red's Mother

Even if things get tough, my path is set—and I won't let anything pull me off course.

Red's MotherShe grips Red's shoulders tightly, her eyes wide with worry as she speaks, making sure her words sink in. "Red, listen to me carefully: if you ever hear howling—no matter where you are or what you're doing—you must run. Don't stop to look, don't try to figure out where it's coming from. Just run, as fast as you can, and don't look back. Do you understand? This is very important." ——Red's Mother

' Her mother, more anxious than before, repeats her warnings in a firmer tone: 'Don't stray from the path, no matter what.

Promise me you'll stay to the trail.

Don't speak to anyone you don't know.

If anyone tries to talk to you, walk away and come straight home, understand?

And if you hear howling—run.

This is very important.

' After a final, tense hug, Red steps forward into the woods as her mother watches, arms crossed, her worried gaze lingering at the forest's edge until Red disappears among the trees.

# Chapter 3: A Deadly Encounter with the Wolf

Red treads carefully along a narrow path, clutching her basket and scanning the tangled undergrowth for movement.

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from behind a gnarled tree, its fur bristling and yellow eyes locked on Red.

The Wolf circles, its claws digging into the soft mud, and sniffs the air, intent on catching Red's scent.

Red backs away, keeping her basket close, and calls out, 'Stay back!

Red grips her basket tightly to her chest, her eyes wide with fear as she takes another step away from the threat. "Stay back! I mean it—don't come any closer!" ——Red

I'm just passing through.

Red glances over his shoulder, scanning the quiet road ahead, his voice low and edged with fatigue. He shifts the worn bag on his shoulder, as if ready to move on at a moment's notice. "Don't mind me—I won't be here long. Just passing through, that's all." ——Red

Red glances over his shoulder, eyes scanning the empty horizon, fingers tightening around the worn strap of his satchel. "Roads like these have a way of swallowing you up if you linger too long." ——Red

Red glances over his shoulder, eyes scanning the horizon as if expecting someone—or something—to catch up. "Got somewhere I need to be, and it's best if I keep moving before the dust settles." ——Red

' The Wolf lowers its head, lips curling, and responds with a guttural growl, 'Little one, the woods are not safe for stray lambs.

The Wolf's claws flex into the earth as it circles closer, eyes glinting with cold, hungry anticipation. "Did your mother never warn you, little one? These shadows belong to me—and so, soon, will you." ——The Wolf

' Red glances at a nearby fallen branch and, driven by her determination to reach her grandmother, grabs it and brandishes it in warning.

The Wolf lunges, snapping its jaws inches from Red's cloak, but Red swings the branch, striking The Wolf's snout.

The Wolf recoils, growling, and disappears behind a thicket, leaving Red shaken but determined to hurry onward.

The encounter forces Red to decide to take a less-traveled shortcut, hoping to avoid further danger and reach her grandmother before sunset.

# Chapter 4: The Wolf's Invasion

Red steps onto the mossy porch, clutching a leather satchel of medicine, her boots scraping against warped wooden boards.

She knocks twice on the crooked door, the sound echoing inside.

As she waits, a low growl emanates from the thicket;

The Wolf's shadow stretches across the clearing.

Driven by hunger and cunning, The Wolf circles the cottage, its paws sinking into the damp soil, eyes locked on Red.

Red scans the tree line, her breath quickening, then calls out, 'Grandmother, are you there?

' The Wolf, voice gravelly and mocking, responds from behind a fallen log, 'She won't answer you, little one.

' Red's grip tightens on her satchel as she backs toward the door, determined to reach her grandmother and deliver the medicine.

Red glances nervously at the shadowy hallway, then steels herself and steps toward the door, clutching her satchel tightly. "I have to hurry—Grandmother’s counting on me. No matter what’s out there, I can’t let anything stop me now." ——Red

Red steels herself, taking a deep breath before slipping out the door and into the looming dusk. "Even if the shadows feel thicker with every step, I won’t let fear slow me down." ——Red

The Wolf prowls closer, hackles raised, ready to block her path.

The Wolf lowers his head, yellow eyes gleaming, muscles tensed as he plants himself firmly in the middle of the trail, daring her to make a move. "Not another step, little one. This path is mine—and crossing it comes with a price." ——The Wolf

The Wolf bares his teeth, lips curling in a silent snarl, muscles tensed for a sudden leap. "Turn back now, or you'll find my fangs are sharper than your courage." ——The Wolf

# Chapter 5: Red Faces the Imposter

Red steps through the creaking wooden door, clutching her satchel of medicine.

She sets it on the scarred table and scans the dim room, her eyes narrowing at the sight of 'Grandmother' tucked beneath a patchwork quilt.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightcap, turns its snout slightly, keeping most of its face hidden.

Red edges closer, wrinkling her nose at the musky, unfamiliar scent in the air.

She leans in, studying the sharp glint of teeth barely concealed by the quilt, and asks, 'Grandmother, why are your eyes so big?

' The Wolf, voice thick and gravelly, deflects by saying, 'Why, my sweet child, I must wear these spectacles now—my old eyes aren't what they used to be.

Red leans in closer, her brow furrowing in concern as she studies the face under the bonnet, noticing how different her grandmother looks. "Grandmother, why are your eyes so big?" ——Red

Come closer, so I can see that lovely face of yours.

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, pulling the quilt up to shadow his snout. His gaze lingers hungrily on Little Red Riding Hood, though he keeps his tone gentle, almost grandmotherly. "Why, my sweet child, I must wear these spectacles now—my old eyes aren't what they used to be. Come closer, so I can see that lovely face of yours." ——The Wolf

' However, Red, suddenly alarmed, blurts out, 'Stay back!

It's not safe—there's something out there!

' Her instincts, already on edge from the unfamiliar scent and the odd behavior of her 'grandmother,' make her suspect danger both inside and outside the cabin.

She hesitates, torn between approaching and retreating.

The Wolf, sensing her unease, tenses beneath the covers, ready to spring if she lets her guard down.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Huntsman Intervenes

Red pushes through a bramble thicket, scraping her arm as she presses forward, intent on reaching her grandmother’s cottage before dusk.

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from behind a mossy log, baring its teeth and blocking her path with a low, guttural growl.

Red freezes, gripping the basket tighter and glancing over her shoulder for escape.

The Wolf pads closer, its tongue flicking and nostrils flaring as it sniffs for the scent of food.

Before The Wolf can lunge, twigs snap behind them;

The Huntsman steps into the clearing, boots crunching on wet leaves, crossbow raised.

He calls out in a gravelly voice, 'Step back, beast.

You’ll find no easy meal here.

' The Wolf snarls, circles once, then slinks into the underbrush, yellow eyes glaring.

The Huntsman lowers his weapon, nods curtly to Red, and gestures for her to follow the safe route.

Red obeys, her steps hurried and purposeful, basket swinging as she moves.

The encounter ends with Red and The Huntsman striding toward the distant cottage, the wolf’s presence lingering in the hushed woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Final Confrontation

Red, clutching the satchel of medicine, creeps along the mossy flagstones toward her grandmother's door.

She pauses, noticing muddy pawprints smeared across the threshold and the faint, rancid odor of wet fur.

The Wolf, jaws parted and eyes glinting, emerges from behind the woodpile, blocking Red's path and growling low, 'Too late, little messenger.

' Red, heart pounding, raises her walking stick and swings it at the Wolf, striking his muzzle.

The Wolf snaps at her, teeth flashing, but a sharp report cracks through the air—a warning shot from the Huntsman, who strides out from the treeline with rifle raised and voice hard: 'Step back, beast.

' The Wolf snarls, circling, but the Huntsman advances, boots crushing ferns, forcing the predator to retreat into the dark thicket.

Red rushes to the door, throwing it open to reach her grandmother inside.

The Wolf, thwarted and hungry, melts into the shadows, eyeing the humans with cold calculation.

Red slams the door shut, breath ragged, as the Huntsman stands guard outside, scanning the woods for any sign of renewed attack.
