Inside a shadowy, lamp-lit cabin, the floor creaks under Red’s boots as she steps through the door, her hand gripping the handle of her knife. The wind rattles the windowpanes; the fire burns low, casting long, flickering shadows.",

She sets a small basket on a warped table and scans the room, her eyes narrowing at the hunched shape beneath a patchwork quilt on the bed. 'Grandmother' beckons her closer with a crooked finger, voice rasping, 'Come nearer, child.' Red advances, knife hidden at her side, noting the unnatural length of the figure’s hands gripping the quilt. As she steps within reach, the creature’s jaws part in a jagged grin, revealing sharp, glistening teeth. Red lunges back, kicking the table between them, sending the basket crashing to the floor. The Wolf throws off the quilt with a guttural snarl, baring its true monstrous form, claws scraping the wooden boards. Red raises her knife, positioning herself between the beast and the door, determined to stand her ground and uncover what became of the real Grandmother.",

Red's Mother follows, clutching Red's arm and whispering, 'Stay out of those woods, child. The wolf is real.' Red pulls away gently, adjusting her red cloak, and replies, 'I have to find Grandmother. She needs me.' Red's Mother thrusts a small loaf of bread into Red's satchel and presses a kiss to her forehead before turning back towards the village, glancing nervously at the dark trees. Red squares her shoulders, listens as the distant caw of a crow echoes, and steps into the shadowy forest, intent on reaching her grandmother's cabin.",

Red's mother moves about the room, briskly chopping roots for stew, her knife thudding against the cutting board. Glancing at Red, she wipes her hands on her apron and insists, 'You’re not to go. The woods aren’t safe.' Red folds the letter, tucking it into her cloak, her jaw set in determination. She moves to the cupboard, selects her hunting knife, and fastens it at her belt. A memory flashes—her grandmother teaching her to sharpen a blade by lantern light, warning her never to stray from the path. With her mother watching, Red lifts a loaf of bread and a jar of preserves into her satchel, preparing for the journey. The crow’s cry grows louder as Red steps toward the door, her mother blocking the way. They lock eyes; the mother’s worry is clear, but Red’s resolve is unyielding. Finally, her mother relents, pressing a sprig of wolfsbane into Red’s palm. 'For luck,' she says. Red nods, gripping the herb tight before stepping out into the misty morning, the scent of moss and distant pine following her as she heads toward the looming woods.",

She pauses at a snapped branch, crouching to examine muddy paw prints pressed deep into the earth, her gaze darting toward the looming silhouette of the cabin ahead. As she edges closer, the wind carries the faint, unnatural sound of raspy breathing from inside, causing her to flatten against the mossy bark of a nearby tree. Inside the cabin, The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, paces before the hearth, pausing to sniff the air and rearrange a teacup on the table to mimic human habits. Red scans the curtained window, searching for signs of her grandmother, then circles to the back door, her objective clear: to enter quietly and confront the threat before it can harm her family. The Wolf, sensing movement outside, stiffens and moves to the door, claws flexing beneath woven sleeves, intent on luring Red inside. Both hunter and hunted maneuver in tense silence, each driven by the need to protect or to prey.",

A sharp branch snags her cloak, but she tears it free and steps into a small clearing. From the gloom, The Wolf emerges, shifting its form until it stands in an imitation of Grandmother, voice rasping. It circles, claws raking grooves in the damp earth, and riddles Red: 'What walks on two, hunts on four, and feasts on blood?' Red edges sideways, placing the oak between them, and lifts the silver whistle the Huntsman gave her to her lips. The Wolf lunges, jaws snapping, but Red blows the whistle. The shrill sound pierces the air, making The Wolf recoil, snarling. The Wolf's eyes fix on her, calculating. Red, breathing hard, advances with her knife ready, determined to reach Grandmother's cabin beyond the clearing. The Wolf, blocked but not defeated, melts back into the shadows, voice echoing: 'You won't reach her before I do.' Red watches the trees, knife raised, and presses on through the thickening fog.",

He pressed a cold, palm-sized whistle into Red's hand, its surface glinting in the pale light filtering through the canopy. He leaned close, voice rough: 'If the wolf finds you, blow this. Silver carries farther than any cry.' Red tucked the whistle into her satchel, fingers brushing its smooth metal as she nodded, determined to reach her grandmother and heed the Huntsman's warning. The Huntsman faded back into the mist, boots crunching over wet stones, continuing his patrol. Red moved forward, the weight of the whistle anchoring her resolve as she headed deeper into the woods.",

She blows the whistle sharply; a piercing note reverberates, causing the Wolf to snarl and reveal its monstrous form, fur bristling and claws scraping the floor. The Huntsman fires a bolt, shattering a lamp and sending shards flying. Red darts forward, slashing at the Wolf's flank as it lunges, driving it back toward the open doorway. The Wolf snaps at Red, its jaws clamping down on her cloak, but she twists free, landing a cut across its snout. The Huntsman reloads, barking, \"Keep it distracted!\" Both coordinate, herding the Wolf to the threshold, where the moonlight glints on silver traps set earlier. The Wolf hesitates, hackles raised. Red hurls embers from the hearth at its face, forcing it into the trap. The cabin fills with the scent of singed fur and pine smoke as the trap snaps shut on the Wolf's leg, immobilizing it for the final blow.",

Red kneels beside her, inspecting the marks and glancing at the blood-spotted rug. The Huntsman circles the room, checking windows for forced entry and listening for distant howls. Grandmother, voice quivering, recounts how the Wolf took her shape and whispered secrets in a guttural, inhuman voice; she describes the Wolf’s eyes as flickering candle flames, its breath sour and heavy. Red listens intently, her jaw set, and asks pointed questions about the Wolf’s transformation. The Huntsman, brow furrowed, explains the Wolf's origins—a curse bound to ancient soil, feeding on fear and family. He presses the silver whistle into Red’s palm, instructing her to keep it close. Red, her resolve clear, stands and slices through the remaining rope binding Grandmother’s wrist, helping her to her feet. The three scan the room, preparing to secure the cabin and plan their next move, united by the urgent need to end the Wolf’s reign.",
