# Chapter 6: Unmasking the Wolf

Red enters the dimly lit cabin, wiping mud from her boots on the rough mat.

She sets a small basket on a warped table and scans the room, her eyes narrowing at the hunched shape beneath a patchwork quilt on the bed.

'Grandmother' beckons her closer with a crooked finger, voice rasping, 'Come nearer, child.

Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)Grandmother pats the edge of the bed with a gnarled hand, her shadow flickering in the dim light. Her smile stretches a little too wide, revealing teeth that gleam sharper than Red remembers. "Come nearer, child. Let your dear old grandmother have a better look at you. My eyes aren't what they used to be." ——Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tighter, her eyes scanning the shadowed figure beneath the covers. "Of course, Grandmother, but—your voice sounds so strange today." ——Red

Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)Grandmother pats the coverlet invitingly, her shadow stretching long and thin across the bed. "It's just a touch of the cold, my sweet—come closer, so I can see your lovely face." ——Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tighter, her eyes scanning the shadowy figure. "All right, Grandmother, but your hands—they look so big and furry under the covers." ——Red

Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)Grandmother (Wolf) stretches out a clawed hand ever so slightly, the shadow on the quilt growing longer as Red hesitates at the foot of the bed. "All the better to hold you with, my dear—now, don't be shy, come just a little bit closer." ——Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)

RedShe takes a wary half-step forward, eyes darting between the shadows and the wolf's disguised face. "Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her fingers twisting nervously in her cloak, 'And your ears, Grandmother—they seem so much longer than before.'" ——Red

Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)Grandmother's (the wolf's) eyes gleam hungrily from the shadows, her lips curling into a toothy grin as she pats the bed invitingly. "All the better to hear your sweet voice with, child—now, step into the light, let your old grandmother see you properly." ——Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)

RedHer voice trembles as she clutches her basket tighter, the shadows flickering across the wolf's grinning maw. "Red inches forward, her eyes darting uncertainly as she whispers, 'And Grandmother, your teeth—they look so sharp and large in your mouth.'" ——Red

Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)Grandmother's lips curl back in a hungry grin, sharp teeth glinting as she lunges forward, the tension snapping into sudden danger. "All the better to eat you with, my dear." ——Grandmother (Wolf in disguise)

' Red approaches cautiously, questioning the strange appearance and voice of her 'grandmother.

' As she hesitates and comments on the oddities—large hands, ears, and sharp, large teeth—the Wolf maintains the disguise but grows increasingly predatory.

When the ruse reaches its breaking point and the Wolf declares, 'All the better to eat you with, my dear,' Red realizes the truth.

The revelation triggers the physical confrontation: Red recoils, possibly drawing her hidden knife or preparing to defend herself, as the Wolf throws off the quilt and reveals its monstrous form, setting up the ensuing struggle.

# Chapter 2: Crossing into the Forbidden Woods

Red tightens the leather strap holding her knife at her belt and steps onto the muddy path leading into the woods.

Her boots sink into the soft earth, leaving deep impressions.

Red's Mother follows, clutching Red's arm and whispering, 'Stay out of those woods, child.

The wolf is real.

Red's MotherShe grips Red's shoulders tightly, her eyes wide with fear as she glances anxiously toward the darkening forest beyond their cottage. "I never believed those old stories, but now—I saw it. The wolf is real, and it's out there, lurking in the woods. We mustn't take any chances. Red, you must stay on the path, and everyone needs to keep their doors locked tonight." ——Red's Mother

' Red's Mother, visibly more shaken than before, confesses, 'I never believed those old stories, but now—I saw it.

The wolf is real, and it's out there, lurking in the woods.

Red clenches her fists at her sides, her expression determined but tinged with worry as she stares into the distance, thinking of the girl who depends on her. "It’s clear to me now—she needs me. Not just for company, not just for comfort, but because something in her life would fall apart without me there to hold it together. I can feel the weight of that responsibility, and it scares me a little… but I can’t turn away from it. I won’t. Not when she’s counting on me." ——Red

Red clenches her fists, determination flickering in her eyes as she glances toward the closed door where Maya waits. "I know that if I walk away now, Maya will lose the one person she trusts, and I can't let that happen." ——Red

We mustn't take any chances.

Red, you must stay on the path, and everyone needs to keep their doors locked tonight.

' Red pulls away gently, adjusting her red cloak, her face set with determination.

She replies, her voice trembling with both fear and resolve, 'It’s clear to me now—Grandmother needs me.

Not just for company, not just for comfort, but because something in her life would fall apart without me there to hold it together.

I can feel the weight of that responsibility, and it scares me a little… but I can’t turn away from it.

I won’t.

Not when she’s counting on me.

' Red hesitates, then adds, 'I know that if I walk away now, Maya will lose the one person she trusts, and I can't let that happen.

' Red's Mother thrusts a small loaf of bread into Red's satchel and presses a kiss to her forehead before turning back towards the village, glancing nervously at the dark trees.

Red squares her shoulders, listens as the distant caw of a crow echoes, and steps into the shadowy forest, intent on reaching her grandmother's cabin.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Urgent Letter

Red stands at the battered kitchen table, her fingers tracing the rough parchment of an urgent letter addressed in her grandmother’s shaky script.

Red's mother moves about the room, briskly chopping roots for stew, her knife thudding against the cutting board.

The tension between them builds as the crow’s cry intensifies outside, echoing warnings and memories of loss.

Red pleads with her mother to let her go, desperate to uncover the truth behind the crow and what happened to her father.

Her mother, wracked with fear and protective love, resists, revealing that the crow is not just a warning but a harbinger of the same darkness that claimed Red’s father.

The conversation grows emotionally raw, both acknowledging the pain and secrets that have haunted their family.

Red expresses her need to face the threat, not just for her grandmother, but to finally confront the shadow looming over them all.

Her mother, torn between fear and love, wishes she could accompany Red but ultimately relents, understanding her daughter's resolve.

She presses a sprig of wolfsbane into Red’s palm for luck and protection, and with words of love and acceptance, Red steps out into the misty morning, determined to face the woods and whatever awaits her.

Red clenches her fists, glancing nervously at the window as the crow's cries sharpen, her voice trembling with urgency. She stands tense, only a few feet from her mother, who remains unwavering in the doorway. "Mom, please move. I have to go—now. Can't you hear it? The crow won't stop." ——Red

Red's MotherShe presses her palm flat against the door, eyes wide and voice trembling, glancing nervously at the window where the crow's silhouette flickers. "No, Red—you’re not going anywhere while that thing’s out there." ——Red's Mother

Red clenches her fists, her eyes darting between her mother’s stern face and the shadowy window where the crow’s silhouette looms. "I don't care about the stupid crow—I have to find out what's really happening!" ——Red

Red's MotherRed’s mother spreads her arms wider, her eyes darting to the window as the crow’s cry pierces the air again, voice trembling between fear and desperation. "You don't understand, Red—the crow is a warning, and if you step outside now, we may never get you back." ——Red's Mother

Red's voice trembles as she grabs the doorknob, her knuckles white, while her mother reaches out, desperation etched across her face. "If you loved me, you'd trust that I know what I'm doing." ——Red

Red's MotherShe presses her back against the door, hands trembling as the crow’s cry pierces the tense silence. "If I didn't love you, I wouldn't be standing here shaking, praying you’ll listen before it’s too late." ——Red's Mother

Red's fists clench at her sides as the crow's cry pierces the air again, echoing through the tense silence between them. "You think locking me in will save me, but all it does is make the screaming louder." ——Red

Red's MotherShe presses her back more firmly against the wood, voice trembling but resolute as the crow's cry pierces the air again. "Red, you have no idea what waits beyond this door—the crow doesn't scream for nothing." ——Red's Mother

Red's hand tightens on the doorknob, her knuckles white as the crow's cries reach a fever pitch outside. "Then let me face it, Mom—because hiding in here is killing me just as surely." ——Red

Red's MotherRed's mother presses her back against the door, her voice trembling as the crow's cry pierces through the silence, her eyes pleading with Red to understand. "You think I want to lock you in? I’m trying to keep you alive, Red—there are things out there you can’t fight with stubbornness." ——Red's Mother

Red grips the doorknob, her knuckles white, the crow’s cry piercing through the silence between them. "If I stay, I'll drown in fear, but if I go, at least I can fight for myself." ——Red

Red's MotherRed's mother tightens her grip on the doorframe, her knuckles white, as the crow's cry crescendos into a shriek that rattles the windows. "You are my world, Red, and I won't lose you to the darkness that calls outside." ——Red's Mother

Red’s voice cracks as she grips the doorknob, the crow’s shrieking echoing through the walls, her mother’s hands trembling as she presses back against the door, torn between confession and protection. "If you won't let me go, then at least tell me what you're so afraid of—please, Mom." ——Red

Red's MotherHer mother’s hand trembles on the doorknob, eyes pleading and wet with unshed tears as the crow's cry pierces the silence again. "The crow isn’t just warning us—it’s calling for what took your father, Red." ——Red's Mother

Red's hand tightens on the doorknob, her knuckles white, as the crow's cry crescendos outside. "Then I need to know what took him, because running from it hasn't brought him back." ——Red

Red's MotherRed's mother grips the doorframe, her knuckles white, voice trembling as the crow’s cry pierces the growing dusk. "If you walk out that door, you’ll meet the same shadow that swallowed him whole." ——Red's Mother

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Grandmother's Isolated Cabin

Red advances carefully along the muddy path, gripping her knife with white-knuckled determination.

She pauses at a snapped branch, crouching to examine muddy paw prints pressed deep into the earth, her gaze darting toward the looming silhouette of the cabin ahead.

As she edges closer, the wind carries the faint, unnatural sound of raspy breathing from inside, causing her to flatten against the mossy bark of a nearby tree.

Inside the cabin, The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, paces before the hearth, pausing to sniff the air and rearrange a teacup on the table to mimic human habits.

Red scans the curtained window, searching for signs of her grandmother, then circles to the back door, her objective clear: to enter quietly and confront the threat before it can harm her family.

The Wolf, sensing movement outside, stiffens and moves to the door, claws flexing beneath woven sleeves, intent on luring Red inside.

Both hunter and hunted maneuver in tense silence, each driven by the need to protect or to prey.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: The Wolf's Trap

Red, tense and wary, calls for her grandmother as she enters the old cabin.

A voice answers from the shadows, beckoning her closer.

Red pushes aside tangled branches, her voice trembling as she calls out. She pauses, listening intently, but the only response is the rustle of leaves and distant birdsong. "Grandmother? Grandmother, are you there? It's me, Red! Please answer me!" ——Red

GrandmotherHer voice is faint and wavering, drifting from the shadowed corner of the cottage, but there's an unusual edge to it. "Red, dear, is that you? Come closer so I can see you." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates at the threshold, clutching her basket tighter as she peers anxiously into the dim room. "Grandmother, your voice sounds strange—are you feeling alright?" ——Red

Grandmother shifts beneath the covers, her silhouette barely visible in the dimness as she gestures Red closer with a trembling hand. "Oh, my sweet girl, come into the light so I can get a good look at you—my eyes aren't what they used to be." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates at the threshold, clutching her basket tighter as she peers into the dimly lit room, her heart pounding. "Something doesn't feel right—Grandmother, why are you hiding in the shadows?" ——Red

Grandmother shifts deeper into the shadows, her silhouette barely visible, her tone both coaxing and uneasy. "Don't be frightened, child—just come a little closer so I can explain." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates at the edge of the shadows, gripping her basket tightly as her eyes dart around the dim room. "Grandmother, I'm scared—please step into the light so I know it's really you." ——Red

Grandmother's silhouette shifts slightly in the gloom, one gnarled hand stretching toward Red from beneath the covers. "Red, darling, there's nothing to fear—just reach out your hand so I can hold it." ——Grandmother

Red hesitantly reaches forward, her trembling fingers brushing against the figure in the shadows, her heart pounding in her chest. "Grandmother, your hand feels so cold—are you sure you're alright?" ——Red

Grandmother stretches out her arms, beckoning Red nearer, her shadow flickering strangely in the dim light. "Oh, my precious Red, it's just a draft in this old house—but come closer, let me wrap you in my arms and warm you up." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates, her heart pounding as she tries to pull back, eyes searching her grandmother's shadowed face for reassurance. "Grandmother, your grip is so strong—I've never felt you hold me like this before." ——Red

Grandmother pulls Red even closer, her shadow looming larger in the dim light. "Red, my dear, sometimes when we are afraid, we hold on a little tighter—don't you trust your own grandmother?" ——Grandmother

Red tries to pull back, her heart pounding as she peers anxiously into the shadowy face before her. "Grandmother, your embrace is almost hurting me—please, let go if something's wrong!" ——Red

Grandmother's voice trembles, her hold tightening as shadows flicker across her face. "Red, why would you say such a thing—I'm only trying to keep you safe, my sweet child." ——Grandmother

Red tries to pull away, her heart pounding as she stares into the shadows, searching for a familiar face. "Grandmother, your eyes—they look so different, and your voice keeps changing; please, tell me what's happening!" ——Red

Grandmother's shadow looms larger as she pulls Red closer, her eyes glinting strangely in the dim light. "Red, my child, you mustn't question so much—just stay close to me and everything will be alright." ——Grandmother

Red steps hesitantly forward, her heart pounding as she peers anxiously into the shadows where her grandmother sits. "Grandmother, I'm begging you—please just let me see your face in the light!" ——Red

Grandmother's silhouette shifts in the dimness, her features still obscured by the shadows as she beckons Red forward with a trembling hand. "Red, don't be afraid—just a little closer, and you'll see everything as it truly is." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates on the threshold, clutching her basket tightly, her breath quickening as she peers into the darkness, desperate for reassurance. "No—please, Grandmother, I can't move any closer until you show me your face—I'm too frightened!" ——Red

Grandmother's shadowy form leans forward, the dim light glinting off eyes that seem almost unfamiliar. "Red, my darling, if you truly love me, just one more step—then all your fears will fade away." ——Grandmother

Red stands frozen at the edge of the dim lamplight, her hands trembling as she hugs her basket tightly to her chest, eyes darting between the shadows and the figure in the bed. "Grandmother, please—I can't take another step until you promise me you're really you!" ——Red

Red, suspicious but desperate, questions the voice's authenticity, noting oddities in the voice and appearance.

Despite her unease, she is gradually drawn into a tense exchange with 'Grandmother,' who remains mostly hidden in the gloom.

The Wolf, cloaked in Grandmother's gown, sits hunched in the dim light, its eyes glinting beneath the lace bonnet, voice trembling as it beckons Red nearer with a thin, clawed hand hidden beneath the covers. "Come closer, child. The shadows grow long and my old eyes do not see you well. Have you brought what I asked for?" ——The Wolf

Red edges closer, clutching her basket tightly, peering through the dim light at the figure in the bed, her brow furrowing with concern and a hint of doubt. "Yes, Grandmother, I brought you bread and honey, but. your voice sounds so rough—are you feeling unwell?" ——Red

The Wolf pats the bed with a trembling, claw-tipped hand concealed beneath the covers, eyes glinting hungrily in the dim light. "Ah, my sweet, age weaves thorns in my throat—come nearer so I may see your gentle face and taste your kindness." ——The Wolf

Red edges forward, clutching her basket tighter, her gaze searching the shadowed contours of the Wolf's altered face. "Grandmother, what big eyes you have—they gleam so strangely in the candlelight." ——Red

The Wolf leans forward from the bed, shadows deepening around its face, lips curling in an attempt at a gentle smile. "All the better to see your beautiful smile, my dear—step closer and let me look upon you." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, clutching her basket tighter, her gaze lingering on the unnatural shape beneath the covers. "Grandmother, your ears—they seem so long and pointed tonight; did you change your cap?" ——Red

The Wolf pats the bed covers with a clawed hand hidden beneath a lace blanket, its eyes never leaving Red. "Oh, child, the winds have teased my cap and made my ears stretch so—come, sit by my side and warm yourself." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the edge of the bed, clutching her basket tightly, eyes fixed on the Wolf's mouth as unease flickers across her face. "Grandmother, what sharp teeth you have—they glisten like silver needles in the dark." ——Red

The Wolf lunges from the bed, jaws wide, the ruse finally dropped as the candle flickers wildly in Red's trembling hands. "All the better to eat you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red resists stepping fully into the light or within reach, repeatedly asking her grandmother to reveal herself.

The voice persists, alternating between reassurance and subtle manipulation, until finally The Wolf, unable to maintain the pretense, drops the charade and reveals itself with the infamous line, 'All the better to eat you with, my dear.

' The chapter ends with The Wolf about to strike, Red's suspicions confirmed too late, setting up the imminent confrontation.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Encounter with the Huntsman

Red paused on the muddy trail, her boots sinking slightly into the moss as she scanned the shifting fog.

The Huntsman stepped out from behind a leaning pine, his cloak damp and flecked with mud, one hand gripping his silver-bladed axe.

He pressed a cold, palm-sized whistle into Red's hand, its surface glinting in the pale light filtering through the canopy.

Leaning close, his voice rough and urgent, the Huntsman stressed the gravity of the situation: 'If you so much as hear a branch snap or see a shadow move where it shouldn't, you blow this horn.

The HuntsmanHe presses a small, carved horn into your trembling hands, his eyes fierce and unwavering, scanning the darkening forest as if expecting danger at any moment. "Listen to me—this isn't a game. The wolf out there, it isn't like anything you've ever known. If you so much as hear a branch snap or see a shadow move where it shouldn't, you blow this horn. Do you understand? It's not just for you—it's for both of us. I’ll come running, no matter what. But you must promise me: don’t try to face it alone. Blow the horn. Trust me." ——The Huntsman

It's not just for you—it's for both of us.

The Huntsman runs his thumb along the edge of a silvered blade, watching its reflection flicker in the dying light. His gaze lingers in the gloom beyond the trees, as if expecting the forest itself to answer. "They say a scream can shatter the stillness, but silver—silver cuts through silence and memory alike. It sings, sharp and cold, long after voices falter. A warning, a promise, a judgment—its gleam is enough to send shadows fleeing and hearts pounding. No plea ever traveled as far as the glint of silver in the dark." ——The Huntsman

I’ll come running, no matter what.

But you must promise me: don’t try to face it alone.

Blow the horn.

Trust me.

' He explained that silver's sound was more than a warning, that it cut through silence and memory alike—a promise and a judgment against the darkness.

Red tucked the whistle into her satchel, the Huntsman's words weighing heavily on her resolve.

Determined to reach her grandmother and heed his warning, she nodded.

The Huntsman faded back into the mist, boots crunching over wet stones, continuing his patrol, ready to respond if Red called.

Red moved forward, the weight of the whistle anchoring her courage as she headed deeper into the woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Huntsman's Final Stand

Red stands just outside the bedroom doorway, gripping her knife tightly as The Wolf, still successfully mimicking Grandmother’s voice, attempts to lure her closer.

Red, suspicious, verbally probes the Wolf with classic questions about its appearance but does not yet fully expose the deception.

The Wolf lies curled in Grandmother's bed, voice trembling with feigned frailty, beckoning Red to draw nearer to the shadowed bedside. "Come in, dear child. I'm feeling ever so weak today, and I would dearly love to see your sweet face up close." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the doorway, clutching her basket tighter and peering uncertainly toward the shadowed bed. "Grandmother, your voice sounds a little strange—are you sure you're all right?" ——Red

The Wolf shifts under the covers, pulling the quilt higher to obscure its face. "Oh, it's just a touch of the cold, my dear—come closer so I can see you better; these old eyes aren't what they used to be." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, peering uncertainly at the shadowy figure beneath the covers. "But Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" ——Red

The Wolf pats the empty space on the bed invitingly, his gaze fixed hungrily on Red. "All the better to see you with, my child—now, won't you come a bit nearer so I can give you a proper hug?" ——The Wolf

The Huntsman remains hidden, crossbow ready, awaiting Red’s signal.

The tense verbal exchange continues, heightening Red’s caution.

Instead of immediately revealing the Wolf’s monstrous form and launching into combat, Red delays, seeking further confirmation and trying to buy time for the Huntsman to prepare.

The confrontation escalates only after Red’s suspicions are confirmed by the Wolf’s increasingly predatory responses.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Aftermath and Revelation

Red pushes open the warped cabin door, knife gripped in her hand, scanning the gloom for movement.

The Huntsman follows, crossbow loaded and silver whistle at his lips, boots crunching on scattered pine needles.

Grandmother, wrapped in a threadbare shawl, huddles near the fireplace, her hands trembling as she points to claw marks gouged into the wall.

Red kneels beside her, inspecting the marks and glancing at the blood-spotted rug.

The Huntsman circles the room, checking windows for forced entry and listening for distant howls.

Grandmother, voice quivering, recounts how the Wolf took her shape and whispered secrets in a guttural, inhuman voice;

Grandmother clutches her shawl tighter around her shoulders, her hands trembling as she stares into the distance, haunted by the memory. "Oh, my dear, I can still feel the chill in my bones. The Wolf, he—he wore my face, but his eyes, they weren't mine. And the way he spoke. it wasn't my voice at all. It was twisted, deep and rough, like gravel scraping over stone. He leaned close, so close, and whispered things—horrible secrets—things no living soul should know. Each word crawled under my skin, cold and heavy. I was so afraid, so helpless, listening to that voice using my mouth to say such monstrous things." ——Grandmother

she describes the Wolf’s eyes as flickering candle flames, its breath sour and heavy.

Grandmother leans closer, voice trembling, as she recounts her chilling encounter with the Wolf. "Child, when the Wolf came near, I saw its eyes—burning like flickering candle flames in the dark, never steady, always searching. Its breath hung thick and sour in the air, so heavy I could taste it, and every time it exhaled, the room felt colder. Beware, for such a creature carries menace in every glance and every breath." ——Grandmother

Red listens intently, her jaw set, and asks pointed questions about the Wolf’s transformation.

Red narrows her eyes, leaning forward, her voice sharp and unwavering as she studies the Wolf’s reaction. "You expect me to believe you just changed overnight? No one wakes up a different creature without a reason. Tell me exactly how it happened—every detail. And don’t leave anything out. Why did you do it, Wolf?" ——Red

The Huntsman, brow furrowed, explains the Wolf's origins—a curse bound to ancient soil, feeding on fear and family.

The Huntsman leans on his axe, gaze distant, voice heavy with sorrow. He gestures to the earth, as if feeling the pulse of something buried deep and old. "You ask about the Wolf—why it prowls these lands, why its eyes burn with hunger older than memory. Listen well. The beast was not always flesh and fang. Long ago, in the shadow of these ancient woods, a curse was sown into the soil itself—twisted by grief, watered with blood. The Wolf is its harvest. It rises, again and again, drawn to the trembling hearts of families, feasting on their fear. The more we dread, the stronger it grows. Every torn cradle, every midnight wail—that is the meal it craves. And so long as terror roots itself in our homes, the Wolf will never truly die." ——The Huntsman

He presses the silver whistle into Red’s palm, instructing her to keep it close.

The Huntsman curls her fingers around the cool metal, his gaze steady but shadowed by worry. He doesn’t let go until he’s sure she feels the weight of his words—and the gravity of what might come. "Red, listen to me. This isn't just a whistle—it's your call for help, should the darkness ever close in. If you find yourself lost, if the woods turn against you, blow it, and I will come. Keep it close, always. Promise me." ——The Huntsman

Red curls her fingers tightly around the whistle, her eyes meeting the Huntsman's with a flicker of fear and trust mingling in their depths. "I promise, I'll keep it with me—no matter what." ——Red

Red, her resolve clear, stands and slices through the remaining rope binding Grandmother’s wrist, helping her to her feet.

The three scan the room, preparing to secure the cabin and plan their next move, united by the urgent need to end the Wolf’s reign.

Red scans the dim corners of the room, her jaw clenched with determination. She gestures sharply toward the back of the cabin, then grabs a heavy iron poker from the hearth, her eyes flicking to Grandmother and The Huntsman to ensure they're ready to act. "We don't have much time. Huntsman, check the back door and make sure it's barred. Grandmother, stay close to me—we'll cover the windows. We need to hold this cabin and plan our next move before the Wolf finds us." ——Red

The Huntsman moves swiftly to the back door, inspecting the lock and shoving a heavy chair against it, eyes scanning for any sign of weakness. "Right—I'll secure the door tight, then we regroup by the hearth and lay out a trap that'll end this once and for all." ——The Huntsman

Grandmother moves briskly to a worn cupboard, collecting jars and kitchen knives, her hands steady despite the fear in her eyes. "I'll gather what herbs and sharp tools I have left—we'll need every trick I know if we're to outwit that beast tonight." ——Grandmother
