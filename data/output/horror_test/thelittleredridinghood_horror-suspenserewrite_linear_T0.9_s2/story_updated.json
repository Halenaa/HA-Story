Her mother emerges from the doorway, placing a hand on Red’s shoulder to stop her. She leans in, voice low and urgent, warning Red to stick to the main path and avoid the shadowed parts of the forest. Red listens, then pulls away, determinedly adjusting her hood and promising to be careful. Her mother, still worried, presses a loaf of bread into Red’s hands and watches as Red strides toward the forest trail, the red of her cloak stark against the grey-green morning.",

She pauses as a sudden rustling to her left makes her grip the basket tighter. The Woodsman emerges from behind a thick trunk, his axe slung across his shoulder, boots crunching on twigs. He blocks Red's path and raises a hand in greeting but keeps his eyes scanning the shadows. 'It's late, Red. The forest isn't safe—especially now,' he warns, his voice low and gravelly. Red, determined to reach her grandmother, insists on pressing forward despite the dangers, emphasizing her urgency and the importance of her errand. The Woodsman, more cautious than before, warns her of a new, smarter threat lurking in the woods and suggests that hiding alone won't save anyone; he urges Red to warn others if she can. Red refuses to turn back, prioritizing her grandmother's wellbeing over her own safety, and the Woodsman, recognizing both her determination and the gravity of the situation, offers to accompany her as far as possible for protection. As they move together, he points out dangers both natural and unnatural, and they agree to stay alert and communicate closely, with Red promising to heed his warnings along the way. Their journey is marked by urgency, mutual trust, and a heightened awareness of a threat that is more cunning than any wolf.",

She instructs Red to bolt the cellar door and reminds her that the Wolf is a master of deception, able to mimic voices and lure victims. Suddenly, the Wolf—disguised by a shawl and speaking in Grandmother’s voice—lunges from behind the kitchen table, revealing his true form and taunting Red with threats. Red dodges, grabs the iron poker from the fireplace, and swings at the Wolf, driving it back into the shadows. Grandmother searches a drawer for her silver shears, determined to help defend her cottage. The Wolf snarls, retreating but vowing to return stronger, his yellow eyes glinting in the firelight.

The Wolf, disguised in scraps of torn clothing, circles the cottage silently, ears pricked, pausing to sniff the air and taste Red's scent on the wind. As the Wolf draws closer, Red steps out, her frustration boiling over. She shouts, 'Stay back! I swear, if you come any closer—I'll do whatever it takes! She’s not yours to take!' Then, with unexpected defiance, she adds, 'Honestly, I'm tired of always being the one who has to figure out food for everyone. If you're hungry, it's time you start handling your own meals. I'm not your personal chef.' The Wolf snarls, baring its fangs, momentarily thrown by Red's strange deflection. Red uses the Wolf’s hesitation to hurl a stone, striking its flank and drawing its attention away from the cottage door. The Wolf lunges, but Red swings her branch, striking its muzzle and forcing it to retreat, buying precious seconds to dash for the cottage door.",

As Woodsman inspects the fur, he mutters about the Wolf's cunning and the likelihood of a trick, noting that the Wolf may be growing desperate and bold. The group realizes the Wolf is actively hunting, rather than merely passing through, and that someone or something may have provoked it. Woodsman quickly decides they must split up: he will follow the Wolf's tracks to learn more about its intentions, while Red is tasked to warn the village and help reinforce the defenses by gathering stones for the door. Grandmother remains inside, boiling medicinal herbs, determined to keep Red and herself safe. As dusk approaches, Woodsman announces he will patrol the village perimeter, ready to confront the Wolf if it returns.

Also, Red questions the Wolf's intentions and the lost fur, signaling increased suspicion and initiative. The updated plot now includes Woodsman deciding to follow tracks and Red warning the village, aligning with the dialogue's proactive stance and shifting their focus from just fortifying the cottage to also protecting the village."
