# Chapter 1: Red Receives Her Grandmother’s Warning

Red tightens the strap on her medicine satchel as she steps onto the cottage porch, her red cloak brushing the rough wood.

Her mother emerges from the doorway, placing a hand on Red’s shoulder to stop her.

She leans in, voice low and urgent, warning Red to stick to the main path and avoid the shadowed parts of the forest.

Red’s MotherShe grips Red’s shoulders gently but firmly, searching her daughter’s eyes for understanding, her own voice trembling with worry. "Red, listen to me now. You must stay on the main path, do you hear? The shadows between the trees are no place for a girl, not today. Promise me you’ll keep to the sunlight and not wander—there are things in that forest that even I can’t explain." ——Red’s Mother

Red tries to sound brave, but glances nervously at the looming forest beyond the garden gate. "I promise, Mama, I’ll keep to the main path—besides, I’m not afraid of a few shadows." ——Red

Red’s MotherShe gently tucks a loose strand of hair behind Red’s ear, her eyes lingering on her daughter’s face, searching for understanding. "Bravery is good, my love, but wisdom keeps you safe—remember, even the brightest souls can be lost in darkness." ——Red’s Mother

Red listens, then pulls away, determinedly adjusting her hood and promising to be careful.

Red listens to her mother's warnings, then gently pulls away, adjusting her crimson hood with determination gleaming in her eyes. "I know you're worried, Mother. But I promise, I'll stay on the path and be extra careful." ——Red

Red’s MotherShe gently tucks a loose strand of hair behind Red’s ear, her gaze soft but anxious. "I just want you to remember, my dear, that the woods can be full of surprises, so trust your instincts and come straight home if anything feels wrong." ——Red’s Mother

Her mother, still worried, presses a loaf of bread into Red’s hands and watches as Red strides toward the forest trail, the red of her cloak stark against the grey-green morning.

# Chapter 2: The Encounter with the Woodsman

Red, clutching her wicker basket, steps carefully over a fallen log, her red cloak catching on the rough bark.

She pauses as a sudden rustling to her left makes her grip the basket tighter.

The Woodsman emerges from behind a thick trunk, his axe slung across his shoulder, boots crunching on twigs.

He blocks Red's path and raises a hand in greeting but keeps his eyes scanning the shadows.

'It's late, Red.

Woodsman steps from the shadows, axe in hand but lowered, eyes scanning the dark forest around them before settling on Red with a mixture of worry and sternness. "It's late, Red. You shouldn't be out here alone at this hour." ——Woodsman

Red clutches her basket tighter, glancing nervously at the darkening path behind her. "I know, but Grandma needed these supplies, and I couldn't wait until morning." ——Red

WoodsmanHe glances around the shadowy trees, his grip tightening on his axe as he steps closer to Red. "Still, the woods can be dangerous after dark—next time, let me walk with you." ——Woodsman

Red clutches the basket tighter and glances nervously down the shadowy path. "Thank you, but I didn't want to bother anyone—I'll be quick, I promise." ——Red

Woodsman adjusts his grip on his axe and steps closer, scanning the shadows between the trees. "I don't mind being bothered if it means you're safe—at least let me walk you the rest of the way." ——Woodsman

The forest isn't safe—especially now,' he warns, his voice low and gravelly.

WoodsmanHe steps closer to Red, glancing nervously over his shoulder at the darkening woods, fingers tightening around the axe at his side. "Listen, Red—the forest isn't safe, not like it used to be. There's something out there, lurking between the pines. You need to turn back before it's too late." ——Woodsman

Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes scanning the shadowed treeline as she hesitates, weighing whether to heed the warning or press on. "I know the old paths better than anyone, but if even you are afraid, then whatever's out there must be worse than wolves." ——Red

WoodsmanThe woodsman grips his axe tighter, scanning the treeline as the last light fades. "It's not just worse—it's smarter, and it hunts after dusk; I've seen the shadows move where nothing should." ——Woodsman

Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes scanning the darkening treeline as she weighs her next move. "If it's learning to stalk us, then hiding won't save anyone—we need to warn the others." ——Red

WoodsmanHe grips her arm with calloused fingers, eyes darting to the darkening woods behind her. "No one will believe you until it's too late, Red—so if you go, go swift, and don't stray from the river's edge." ——Woodsman

Red, determined to reach her grandmother, insists on pressing forward despite the dangers, emphasizing her urgency and the importance of her errand.

Red tightens her grip on the basket and lifts her chin, her eyes fixed firmly on the path ahead. "I can't stop now—my grandmother is waiting, and she needs this medicine. I promised I'd get it to her as quickly as I could." ——Red

WoodsmanThe Woodsman steps in front of Red, concern evident in his voice as he glances at the deepening shadows around them. "Are you sure it's safe to rush through these woods alone, Red?" ——Woodsman

Red tightens her grip on the basket and steps forward, her resolve clear in her eyes. "I know the risks, but my grandmother's wellbeing depends on me, and I can't let fear slow me down." ——Red

WoodsmanThe Woodsman steps closer, his axe resting on his shoulder, offering a steadying presence beside Red. "Still, even the bravest can run into trouble—let me at least walk with you part of the way, just in case." ——Woodsman

Red tightens her grip on the basket and quickens her pace, glancing anxiously down the shadowed path. "Thank you, Woodsman—I won't turn down your company, but I can't afford to lose any time." ——Red

The Woodsman, more cautious than before, warns her of a new, smarter threat lurking in the woods and suggests that hiding alone won't save anyone;

Red stands abruptly, clenching her cloak tighter around her, her face tense with worry as she looks urgently at Woodsman. "Woodsman, I can't stay here any longer—my grandmother, she's alone and she's sick. She needs me now more than ever. If I don't get to her soon, I don't know what might happen." ——Red

Woodsman places a reassuring hand on Red's shoulder, his expression resolute. "Red, I understand—your grandmother is like family to me too, and if she truly needs you, then I'll help you get to her as fast as we can." ——Woodsman

he urges Red to warn others if she can.

Red refuses to turn back, prioritizing her grandmother's wellbeing over her own safety, and the Woodsman, recognizing both her determination and the gravity of the situation, offers to accompany her as far as possible for protection.

As they move together, he points out dangers both natural and unnatural, and they agree to stay alert and communicate closely, with Red promising to heed his warnings along the way.

Their journey is marked by urgency, mutual trust, and a heightened awareness of a threat that is more cunning than any wolf.

WoodsmanHe glances over his shoulder at Red, voice low but steady, guiding her around a thick tangle of roots and keeping a watchful eye on the deepening gloom between the trees. "Stay close, Red. The forest isn’t as peaceful as it looks; shadows here can hide more than just rabbits. I know every path and danger—no wolf or worse will lay a claw on you while I’m by your side." ——Woodsman

Red glances nervously between the trees, tightening her grip on her basket as she walks a little closer to the Woodsman. "Thank you, Woodsman—I trust you, but what kinds of dangers are really out here?" ——Red

WoodsmanHe glances back at her, eyes scanning the undergrowth, his hand resting reassuringly on the axe at his belt. "There are wolves, yes, but also snares left by trappers, sudden drops where the ground gives way, and sometimes, the forest itself seems to whisper warnings—so keep your wits sharp and your steps quiet." ——Woodsman

Red glances anxiously at the twisted trees, clutching her basket a little tighter as she matches her pace to the Woodsman's stride. "I’ll do my best to listen and keep close—if you hear anything strange, will you tell me right away?" ——Red

WoodsmanHe scans the trees ahead, his grip tightening on the axe at his side, listening for any unnatural sounds. "Of course, Red—if the wind changes or a branch snaps where it shouldn't, I'll make sure you know before we take another step." ——Woodsman

# Chapter 3: The Wolf’s Trap in the Shadows

Red arrives at the edge of her grandmother's clearing, gripping her medicine basket tightly and scanning the shadowy tree line for movement.

She knocks firmly on the warped wooden door, her boots squelching on the damp moss.

Inside, Grandmother peers through a cracked window, recognizes Red, and hurriedly unlocks the door, motioning her inside.

As Red steps over the threshold, the faint rustle of paws on leaves comes from behind the cottage—The Wolf, hidden in the gathering shadows, circles the small home, nose twitching as it sniffs the air for Red’s scent.

Grandmother bolts the door behind Red and whispers, 'You must stay close, child.

Something’s prowling tonight.

' Red sets down her basket and checks the shuttered window, determined to protect her grandmother, while outside, The Wolf presses its ear to the wall, listening for voices and plotting its next move.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Red’s Confrontation at the Cottage

Red pushes open the creaking cottage door, clutching a basket of medicines, her red cloak trailing over the warped floorboards.

Grandmother, pale but resolute, limps to barricade the window with a heavy oak chair, whispering warnings about the Wolf’s cunning and urging Red to trust her senses over appearances.

Grandmother drags the heavy oak chair across the floor with a grunt, wedging it beneath the window latch. Her hands tremble as she smooths her apron and casts nervous glances at every corner, lips pressed to a thin, determined line. "Hush now—keep low. That beast is cleverer than hunger itself. He'll try the latch, the cracks, even the chimney if he thinks it’ll get him in. I've seen his shadow slip through darker nights than this. Don't trust your eyes, child—trust the weight of the wood." ——Grandmother

Grandmother presses her trembling hand to the doorframe, listening for the faintest scrape or whisper beyond the wood. "If he calls your name sweetly, remember: the Wolf has worn a hundred voices to steal into lonely hearts." ——Grandmother

Grandmother presses her trembling palm against the doorframe, listening for the faintest scratch on the timber. "Bolt the cellar door, darling—he feigns patience when he prowls, but his patience is just another snare." ——Grandmother

She instructs Red to bolt the cellar door and reminds her that the Wolf is a master of deception, able to mimic voices and lure victims.

The Wolf throws off the shawl, baring its fangs, and lunges from behind the kitchen table, swiping at Red with a clawed hand. "Ah, my dear, did you really think a shawl and a soft voice could hide the hunger in my bones? Come closer, Red—let me show you what big teeth I really have!" ——The Wolf

The Wolf bares its fangs, leaping from behind the table with a guttural growl, claws outstretched toward Red. "Foolish child, it's not your grandmother who waits for you—it's the end of your story!" ——The Wolf

Suddenly, the Wolf—disguised by a shawl and speaking in Grandmother’s voice—lunges from behind the kitchen table, revealing his true form and taunting Red with threats.

Red dodges, grabs the iron poker from the fireplace, and swings at the Wolf, driving it back into the shadows.

Grandmother searches a drawer for her silver shears, determined to help defend her cottage.

The Wolf bares its teeth in a final, guttural snarl before melting into the shadows, its eyes never leaving its adversary. "You think this is over? Remember the scent of my fury—I will return, stronger than before, and your fire won't save you next time." ——The Wolf

The Wolf snarls, retreating but vowing to return stronger, his yellow eyes glinting in the firelight.

Red and Grandmother quickly reinforce the door, locking out the beast for now.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: The Fight for Survival

Red crouches behind a moss-covered log, clutching a heavy branch, her red cloak catching on brambles.

She scans the tree line, searching for movement, determined to protect her injured Grandmother still inside the cottage.

The Wolf, disguised in scraps of torn clothing, circles the cottage silently, ears pricked, pausing to sniff the air and taste Red's scent on the wind.

As the Wolf draws closer, Red steps out, her frustration boiling over.

She shouts, 'Stay back!

I swear, if you come any closer—I'll do whatever it takes!

Red positions herself between the threat and the girl, breaths coming fast and ragged, eyes wild with fear and fury. Her hands tremble, but she holds them out protectively, ready to fight. "Stay back! I swear, if you come any closer—I'll do whatever it takes! She’s not yours to take!" ——Red

She’s not yours to take!

Red crosses their arms, looking both frustrated and worn out, making it clear they're done with the current arrangement. "Honestly, I'm tired of always being the one who has to figure out food for everyone. If you're hungry, it's time you start handling your own meals. I'm not your personal chef." ——Red

' Then, with unexpected defiance, she adds, 'Honestly, I'm tired of always being the one who has to figure out food for everyone.

If you're hungry, it's time you start handling your own meals.

I'm not your personal chef.

' The Wolf snarls, baring its fangs, momentarily thrown by Red's strange deflection.

Red uses the Wolf’s hesitation to hurl a stone, striking its flank and drawing its attention away from the cottage door.

The Wolf lunges, but Red swings her branch, striking its muzzle and forcing it to retreat, buying precious seconds to dash for the cottage door.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Truth Revealed and Aftermath

Red kneels by the threshold, examining deep claw marks gouged into the wooden door, as Woodsman paces the perimeter, scanning for fresh tracks with his axe hefted.

Red traces the jagged grooves with trembling fingers, glancing over her shoulder with a mix of dread and determination toward Woodsman. "Woodsman, look at these marks. They're deeper than anything I've seen before—the beast was desperate, or furious. It tried to tear straight through the door." ——Red

Woodsman crouches low beside the prints, frowning as he traces the outline with calloused fingers, then glances up at Red, jaw set. "Aye, and these tracks—fresh, wide-set, heavier than the last time; whatever did this isn’t just passing through, Red, it’s hunting." ——Woodsman

Red rises, jaw set, exchanging a tense glance with Woodsman as he tightens his grip on her basket, determination flaring in her eyes. "If it's hunting, then someone—or something—drove it to this, and we need to find out who before it circles back." ——Red

Woodsman tightens his grip on the axe, glancing once at Red for confirmation before striding toward the tangled underbrush where the tracks vanish. "We have to move fast—I'll follow the tracks, you warn the village; if we split up, it won't catch us both off guard." ——Woodsman

Grandmother, clutching her shawl tightly, unbolts the window and points to a scrap of fur snagged on the sill, urging Red to bring it to Woodsman.

Grandmother clutches her shawl tighter, voice trembling, as she points with a shaking finger to the tuft of fur caught on the window sill, her eyes darting anxiously toward the edge of the forest. "Red, child, come quickly—look here! See this. this bit of fur caught on the window? I found it just now, and it chills me to my bones. Take it straight to the Woodsman, will you? He’ll know what it means. Hurry, now—there’s more to fear in these woods than shadows tonight." ——Grandmother

Red gently takes the fur scrap from Grandmother’s trembling fingers, tucks it safely into her basket, and heads for the door, glancing anxiously at the darkening woods outside. "I understand, Grandmother—I’ll go to him right away, and I won’t let anyone see me with it." ——Red

As Woodsman inspects the fur, he mutters about the Wolf's cunning and the likelihood of a trick, noting that the Wolf may be growing desperate and bold.

Woodsman inspects the ragged fur closely, brow furrowed, then gestures urgently toward the stone pile outside, keeping a wary eye on the forest edge. "Hmm. look at this, Red. The Wolf may be gone, but he left his fur behind as a trick—he's cleverer than most give him credit for. We can't trust that he's finished with us yet. I want you to gather as many stones as you can carry. We'll reinforce the door—if he tries anything, he'll find we're ready for him." ——Woodsman

Red hesitates, glancing nervously at the pile of fur before moving toward the doorway to start searching for stones. "But do you really think he'll come back, even after losing his fur?" ——Red

WoodsmanThe Woodsman kneels by the door, running his hand along its edge as he eyes the darkening forest, motioning for Red to hurry with the stones. "I've seen sly beasts double back before, Red—he's desperate now, and desperation makes the cunning even bolder." ——Woodsman

Red glances nervously at the fur, then quickly heads outside, scanning the ground for sturdy stones. "Alright, I'll start gathering stones right away—just tell me where to pile them." ——Red

The group realizes the Wolf is actively hunting, rather than merely passing through, and that someone or something may have provoked it.

Woodsman quickly decides they must split up: he will follow the Wolf's tracks to learn more about its intentions, while Red is tasked to warn the village and help reinforce the defenses by gathering stones for the door.

Grandmother remains inside, boiling medicinal herbs, determined to keep Red and herself safe.

Woodsman tightens his grip on his axe, jaw set with determination. He glances at Red, searching her face for any sign of hesitation or resolve as the sun dips lower, casting long shadows through the trees. "I'll be taking the first patrol at dusk. If the Wolf dares show its muzzle near the village tonight, I won't let it slip away again. We've lost too much already to sit idly by. Stay close, Red. This isn't over yet." ——Woodsman

Red grips her cloak tighter, resolve flickering beneath her worried gaze as she glances toward the darkening forest. "I understand, Woodsman—I'll keep my eyes sharp and my lantern ready; whatever comes, we face it together." ——Red

As dusk approaches, Woodsman announces he will patrol the village perimeter, ready to confront the Wolf if it returns.

Red, now more involved in protecting not just her family but the entire village, prepares to assist Woodsman and keep a vigilant watch.
