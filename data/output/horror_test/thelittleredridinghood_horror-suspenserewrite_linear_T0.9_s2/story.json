Her mother emerges from the doorway, placing a hand on Red’s shoulder to stop her. She leans in, voice low and urgent, warning Red to stick to the main path and avoid the shadowed parts of the forest. Red listens, then pulls away, determinedly adjusting her hood and promising to be careful. Her mother, still worried, presses a loaf of bread into Red’s hands and watches as Red strides toward the forest trail, the red of her cloak stark against the grey-green morning.",

She pauses as a sudden rustling to her left makes her grip the basket tighter. The Woodsman emerges from behind a thick trunk, his axe slung across his shoulder, boots crunching on twigs. He blocks Red's path and raises a hand in greeting but keeps his eyes scanning the shadows. 'It's late, Red. The forest isn't safe—especially now,' he warns, his voice low and gravelly. Red, determined to reach her grandmother, straightens and replies, 'I have medicine to deliver. She needs me.' The Woodsman nods, frowning, and glances toward the deepening shadows. He steps aside but insists on accompanying her for protection, striding ahead to check for fresh tracks. Red follows, watching as he points out claw marks gouged into a nearby tree trunk, his jaw set with resolve. They move together, boots sinking slightly into the damp moss, as the Woodsman explains the dangers lurking in the forest and vows to help her reach the cottage safely.",

As Red steps over the threshold, the faint rustle of paws on leaves comes from behind the cottage—The Wolf, hidden in the gathering shadows, circles the small home, nose twitching as it sniffs the air for Red’s scent. Grandmother bolts the door behind Red and whispers, 'You must stay close, child. Something’s prowling tonight.' Red sets down her basket and checks the shuttered window, determined to protect her grandmother, while outside, The Wolf presses its ear to the wall, listening for voices and plotting its next move.",

Suddenly, the Wolf—disguised by a shawl and speaking in Grandmother’s voice—lunges from behind the kitchen table, swiping at Red with a clawed hand. Red dodges, grabs the iron poker from the fireplace, and swings at the Wolf, driving it back into the shadows. Grandmother searches a drawer for her silver shears, determined to help defend her cottage. The Wolf snarls, retreating but vowing to return, its yellow eyes glinting in the firelight. Red and Grandmother quickly reinforce the door, locking out the beast for now.",

Red hurls a stone, striking the Wolf's flank and drawing its attention away from the cottage door. The Wolf snarls, baring its fangs, and darts toward Red with a low growl. Red scrambles back, her boots slipping on wet leaves, as she shouts, 'You won't get her! Find your own meal!' The Wolf lunges, but Red swings her branch, striking its muzzle and forcing it to retreat, buying precious seconds to dash for the cottage door.",

Woodsman inspects the fur, muttering about the Wolf's cunning, then instructs Red to gather stones to reinforce the door. Motivated by the need to protect her family, Red stacks rocks while Woodsman sets traps around the cottage, working together to fortify their defenses. Grandmother watches from inside, boiling medicinal herbs as the scent of lavender and smoke drifts out, intent on keeping both Red and herself safe. As the preparations conclude, Woodsman announces they will patrol at dusk, determined to confront the Wolf if it returns.",
