The Woodsman is also depicted as more protective and personally invested in Red's grandmother. The plot is updated to reflect these deepened motivations, the urgency of Red's quest, the Woodsman's increased warnings, and their shared sense of danger.",

The Wolf also taunts Red more directly, revealing himself and making threats, which are consistent with his motivation but are more overt in the dialogue.

To maintain character logic, the plot is updated to reflect Red's emotional exhaustion—perhaps stemming from her broader responsibilities—while still being consistent with her motivation to protect her Grandmother. The new plot incorporates this outburst as part of her confrontation with the Wolf.",

        "plot_change_note": "A minor deviation is present: In the dialogue, Woodsman instructs Red to warn the village and suggests splitting up, which is slightly more proactive and outward-focused than the original plot (where Red only reinforces the cottage and Woodsman sets traps). Also, Red questions the Wolf's intentions and the lost fur, signaling increased suspicion and initiative. The updated plot now includes Woodsman deciding to follow tracks and Red warning the village, aligning with the dialogue's proactive stance and shifting their focus from just fortifying the cottage to also protecting the village.",
