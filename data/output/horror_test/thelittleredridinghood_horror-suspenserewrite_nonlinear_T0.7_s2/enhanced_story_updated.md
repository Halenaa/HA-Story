# Chapter 5: The Final Stand in the Cabin

Red stands pressed against the cabin door, breath sharp and shallow, as she watches the Wolf—a hulking, broad-shouldered figure cloaked in her grandmother's nightgown—prowl toward Grandmother's bed.

Grandmother, gaunt but alert, clutches a heavy iron poker, her knuckles white.

The Wolf lets out a low, guttural growl, lips curling to reveal sharp teeth as he advances.

Red snatches a kitchen knife from the table, the cold handle slick in her palm, and shouts, 'Stay away from her!

' The Wolf whips around, meeting Red's gaze, and feints toward her, claws scraping gouges in the floor.

Grandmother seizes the moment to jam the hot poker against the Wolf's leg, sending up a hiss of singed fur.

The Wolf howls and staggers back, smashing the lamp.

Glass shatters, oil spills, and smoke rises as the fire catches the edge of a blanket.

Red grabs her grandmother's arm, hauling her toward the back door as flames lick up the wall.

Rain-wind blasts their faces as they burst outside.

Behind them, the Wolf's silhouette looms, snarling in the orange glow.

Red drags Grandmother into the darkness of the trees, heart pounding, the taste of smoke and fear sharp in her mouth.

They run, leaving the cabin burning and the Wolf's fury echoing in the night, their escape marked by the uncertainty of what comes next.

----------------------------------------

Smoke and terror still clinging to their skin, Red and her grandmother press deeper into the woods, desperate to put as much distance as possible between themselves and the horrors behind them. With dawn still hours away and the path home blocked by ruin, they have no choice but to seek another way—one whispered about in fearful tones, a narrow trail winding through the heart of the forbidden forest. As they stumble forward, the shadows seem to close in, forcing them toward the shortcut they vowed never to take.

# Chapter 2: The Forbidden Shortcut

Red kept her basket close, tightening her grip on the handle as she stepped carefully over a tangle of exposed roots.

Her eyes scanned the shadowed undergrowth ahead, alert for any sign of movement.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a leaning birch: tall, broad-shouldered, with a dark coat blending into the shadows.

The Wolf inclined his head in greeting, flashing a too-wide smile that revealed sharp, white teeth.

'Good evening, miss.

Traveling alone?

' he asked, his voice smooth but edged with hunger.

Red paused, keeping a cautious distance.

She shifted her weight, evaluating her options, her other hand slipping to the knife at her belt.

But this time, Red met his gaze with open defiance.

'I know why you're here, Wolf.

But you won't find what you're hunting on this path—not today.

' The Wolf's smile widened, intrigued by her boldness.

'Perhaps not, Red—but every path has forks, and every traveler leaves a trail, even you.

' Red narrowed her eyes, her stance unyielding.

Red squares her shoulders, eyes narrowed, hand resting lightly near her satchel as she blocks the narrow trail, every muscle taut with readiness. "I know why you're here, Wolf. But you won't find what you're hunting on this path—not today." ——Red

The Wolf circles just beyond arm's reach, eyes glinting, testing the air for any hint of hesitation in Red's stance. "Perhaps not, Red—but every path has forks, and every traveler leaves a trail, even you." ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, shifting her stance subtly to block the narrowest part of the trail, her hand inching towards the satchel at her side. "Maybe, but I've learned to cover my tracks—and I won't let you lead me astray." ——Red

'Maybe, but I've learned to cover my tracks—and I won't let you lead me astray.

The Wolf steps out from behind a tree, blocking the path with a menacing grin and unblinking eyes fixed on his target. "Well, well. walking alone through my forest, are we? Not the wisest choice. Tell me, little one—where exactly do you think you’re headed?" ——The Wolf

' The Wolf began to circle, his tone turning more predatory.

'Well, well. walking alone through my forest, are we?

Not the wisest choice.

Tell me, little one—where exactly do you think you’re headed?

' Red refused to answer directly, her attention fixed on the nearest escape through the ferns, determined not to let him dictate her route.

The Wolf's ears twitched, his attention sharpening as he assessed her wariness.

Each measured movement revealed their mutual awareness: Red, determined to protect her route and mission;

the Wolf, intent on intimidation and learning her destination.

----------------------------------------

As the dense forest swallowed Red’s footsteps, her resolve hardened with each branch she pushed aside, determined to outpace the Wolf’s cunning. Meanwhile, the shortcut’s tangled shadows concealed more than Red realized; as she pressed forward, the Wolf’s own path unfolded swiftly and silently. Unbeknownst to Red, while she raced against suspicion and time, the Wolf’s intentions led him directly toward a frail cottage nestled at the forest’s edge—her grandmother’s cabin—where the true danger was about to begin.

# Chapter 3: Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s Cabin

The Wolf, hulking beneath a sodden black cloak, circles the cabin's rear, brushing against slick tree trunks and leaving muddy prints in the moss.

He probes the window frames with clawed fingers, testing for weakness, then wedges a shoulder beneath the kitchen window and heaves it open with a low, guttural grunt.

Inside, Grandmother, tending a simmering pot, hears the pane rattle.

She snatches her iron poker from the hearth, stepping back as heavy footfalls thud against the warped floorboards.

The Wolf, looming in the doorway, bares his teeth and advances, blocking the exit.

Grandmother brandishes the poker, voice trembling but loud: 'You’ll not frighten me out, beast.

Grandmother tightens her grip on the poker, planting her feet firmly as she faces the shadow in the doorway, her eyes flashing with fierce resolve despite the tremor in her hands. "You think you can barge in here and terrify an old woman? Well, you've picked the wrong house, beast. I may shake, but I won't run. This is my home, and I'll defend it with every ounce I have." ——Grandmother

' The Wolf feints a lunge, sending the poker clattering aside, then seizes Grandmother’s wrists and shoves her into the corner, scanning the room for threats.

Driven by the need to silence her quickly, he wraps her in a moth-eaten blanket, muffling her cries, and drags her behind the bed, scanning for Red’s imminent arrival.

Rain beats harder against the window as the Wolf scans the cabin, preparing to set his trap.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the forest grows darker, and the rain intensifies, masking the Wolf’s hurried preparations within the cabin. Meanwhile, several miles away, Red remains unaware of the danger awaiting her, focused instead on the weight of the task her mother has entrusted to her. As the Wolf sets his trap, Red’s own journey is about to take a fateful turn, bringing her ever closer to the peril that now lurks in her grandmother’s home.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Dangerous Mission

Red sits at the kitchen table, slicing bread and placing it on a chipped plate, her fingers brushing crumbs onto the floorboards.

Her mother stands by the window, peering into the fog-shrouded woods, then turns and places a folded letter beside Red’s bowl with a decisive gesture.

She speaks in a low, urgent tone, instructing Red to deliver medicine and supplies to Grandmother, whose illness has worsened.

Red’s MotherShe places a small basket into Red’s hands, her expression grave and worried, glancing anxiously toward the forest path. "Red, listen to me carefully. Your grandmother's fever has grown worse overnight. I’ve packed fresh bread, soup, and the medicine the doctor prescribed. You must take these straight to her cottage—don’t delay or stray from the path, do you understand? She needs you now more than ever." ——Red’s Mother

Red takes the basket, her face etched with worry and determination. "I understand, Mother—I’ll go right away and stay on the path; is there anything else I should watch out for?" ——Red

Red’s MotherShe gently hands Red the basket, her eyes filled with worry and urgency. "Be wary of strangers in the woods, Red, and don’t speak to anyone you don’t know—just keep your mind on Grandmother and hurry along." ——Red’s Mother

As Red ties her cloak and packs the basket, her mother presses a cool hand to her shoulder, warning her to stay strictly on the path and avoid strangers.

Red’s MotherShe gently rests her hand on Red’s shoulder, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding and reassurance. "Red, my dear, remember what I always tell you: stay on the path, no matter what, and don’t speak to any strangers. The woods can be dangerous for a young girl on her own." ——Red’s Mother

Red gives her mother a quick, confident smile, cinching her cloak tighter around her shoulders. "I promise, Mama—I’ll go straight to Grandma’s and talk to no one." ——Red

The clink of glass vials and the rough weave of the cloak’s fabric emphasize the careful preparations.

Red nods, her resolve clear, shouldering the basket and stepping onto the dew-slick porch, the chill air biting her cheeks as she sets out toward the shadowed forest.

----------------------------------------

The forest looms ahead, shrouded in mist and whispers, each step drawing Red further from the safety of home and deeper into uncertainty. As she navigates the winding path, the warnings echo in her mind, mingling with the distant sounds of unseen creatures. The familiar trail begins to twist, shadows lengthen, and Red senses she is no longer alone—something unknown is waiting within the deepening gloom, ready to challenge her resolve.

# Chapter 4: Red Confronts the Impostor

Red pauses at the threshold, brushing droplets from her cloak and steadying the basket of supplies on her hip.

She knocks twice, listening to the muffled shuffle of feet inside and the scrape of a chair against the wooden floor.

The Wolf, hidden beneath Grandmother's shawl, clears his throat and calls out in a rasping, unfamiliar tone for Red to enter.

The Wolf tugs the shawl closer around his snout, casting his shadow across the dimly lit room. He forces a quavering softness into his growl, careful to muffle his deeper tones, and fixes his eyes on the latch as footsteps approach. "Come in, dear child. The door is unlatched for you. Don't linger in the cold—Grandmother is waiting." ——The Wolf

Red steps inside, her eyes quickly scanning the dimly lit room: the curtains drawn tight, a faint iron tang in the air, and a steaming mug left untouched on the table.

She sets the basket down, her fingers lingering on the handle as she studies the figure in the bed—broad-shouldered beneath the patchwork quilt, hands tucked carefully out of sight.

Red moves closer, offering the bread and soup, her tone measured and increasingly suspicious as she repeatedly remarks on Grandmother's odd voice, the size and shape of her hands, her teeth, and her eyes.

Red steps forward, setting the bread and soup gently on the bedside table, her eyes lingering on Grandmother's hands as she tries to mask her growing unease with a polite smile. "Grandmother, your voice sounds so different today—almost. rough. Are you feeling alright? And your hands—they seem much larger than I remember." ——Red

Red's caution and quick-wittedness prompt her to voice these concerns directly, signaling her growing suspicion and wariness.

The Wolf shifts under the covers, clawed fingers flexing quietly beneath the blanket. He forces a smile, tilting his head in a mock gesture of affection, eyes glinting with a hungry anticipation as he beckons Red forward. "Ah, my dear, come closer so your poor old grandmother can see you better. It’s been ever so long, hasn’t it? These eyes aren’t what they used to be, and my hands—well, they ache terribly. But I do so long for a hug from my sweet Red. Don’t be shy, child. Come, let me feel your warmth." ——The Wolf

The Wolf, maintaining his disguise but growing more insistent, responds with forced warmth and manipulative pleas for closeness, urging Red to sit beside him to facilitate his attack.

Red hovers at the edge of the bed, hands twisting nervously in her cloak. Her eyes dart over 'Grandmother's' features, searching for any familiar sign, while she inches back a step, uncertain whether she should stay or run. "Grandmother. is something wrong? Your eyes—they look so much bigger than I remember. And your voice sounds different, too. Are you feeling alright?" ——Red

Red inches closer, her voice wavering as she glances nervously at the covers, her fingers tightening around the basket handle. "And your hands—they seem so much larger, almost like claws—have you been ill, Grandmother?" ——Red

Red inches back slightly, her eyes darting between 'Grandmother's' mouth and the door, her voice trembling as suspicion overtakes her courtesy. "And your teeth—I've never seen them so sharp before. are you sure you're my grandmother?" ——Red

Red, however, remains firmly out of reach, her suspicions mounting as she studies the shadowed face beneath the bonnet and refuses to approach, her body tensed for escape.

The Wolf pats the seat next to him, his eyes glinting with a predatory gleam beneath the guise of a welcoming smile. "Come now, my dear, don’t stand so far away. The fire’s warmth is ever so much sweeter up close—and I do enjoy good company on a chilly evening. Won’t you sit beside me, just for a little while?" ——The Wolf

The scene ends with a heightened sense of tension: Red is actively questioning 'Grandmother's' identity, and the Wolf is struggling to maintain his ruse while luring her closer.

----------------------------------------

But as the fire crackled and shadows danced along the walls, Red stood her ground, courage blazing in her eyes, and in that moment the Wolf’s deception unraveled, the night yielding to the certainty that danger could be faced—and survived—when met with wit and unwavering resolve.
