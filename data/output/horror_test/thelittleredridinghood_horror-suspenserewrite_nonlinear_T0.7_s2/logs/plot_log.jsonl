Depict the violent confrontation in the cabin as immediate and visceral, making the reader feel Red’s terror and resolve. Since this is the reader’s first introduction to the characters, avoid assuming any prior knowledge or emotional investment—have Red identify her grandmother and the Wolf explicitly as she perceives them.

End the chapter with Red and her grandmother escaping, then create a sense of unresolved trauma or mystery to prompt the narrative to look backward.", "transition_hint": "After the immediate violence and escape, use Red’s adrenaline-fueled flash of memory or a sensory trigger (e.g., the echo of the Wolf’s words) to propel the reader into the past, signaling the need to understand how things reached this point."}}, "output": {"plot": "Red stands pressed against the cabin door, breath sharp and shallow, as she watches the Wolf—a hulking, broad-shouldered figure cloaked in her grandmother's nightgown—prowl toward Grandmother's bed. Grandmother, gaunt but alert, clutches a heavy iron poker, her knuckles white. The Wolf lets out a low, guttural growl, lips curling to reveal sharp teeth as he advances. Red snatches a kitchen knife from the table, the cold handle slick in her palm, and shouts, 'Stay away from her!' The Wolf whips around, meeting Red's gaze, and feints toward her, claws scraping gouges in the floor. Grandmother seizes the moment to jam the hot poker against the Wolf's leg, sending up a hiss of singed fur. The Wolf howls and staggers back, smashing the lamp. Glass shatters, oil spills, and smoke rises as the fire catches the edge of a blanket. Red grabs her grandmother's arm, hauling her toward the back door as flames lick up the wall. Rain-wind blasts their faces as they burst outside. Behind them, the Wolf's silhouette looms, snarling in the orange glow. Red drags Grandmother into the darkness of the trees, heart pounding, the taste of smoke and fear sharp in her mouth. They run, leaving the cabin burning and the Wolf's fury echoing in the night, their escape marked by the uncertainty of what comes next."}}

Her eyes scanned the shadowed undergrowth ahead, alert for any sign of movement. Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a leaning birch: tall, broad-shouldered, with a dark coat blending into the shadows. The Wolf inclined his head in greeting, flashing a too-wide smile that revealed sharp, white teeth. 'Good evening, miss. Traveling alone?' he asked, his voice smooth but edged with hunger. Red paused, keeping a cautious distance. She shifted her weight, evaluating her options, her other hand slipping to the knife at her belt. 'Just visiting my grandmother,' she replied, her voice steady, watching as the Wolf took a step closer, his gaze lingering on her basket. The Wolf sniffed the air, his nostrils flaring as he feigned polite curiosity. 'The woods are dangerous for the unwary,' he said, circling to block the path ahead. Red sidestepped, refusing to let him dictate her route, her attention fixed on the nearest escape through the ferns. The Wolf's ears twitched, his attention sharpening as he assessed her wariness. Each measured movement revealed their mutual awareness: Red, determined to protect her route and mission; the Wolf, intent on intimidation and learning her destination."}}

Inside, Grandmother, tending a simmering pot, hears the pane rattle. She snatches her iron poker from the hearth, stepping back as heavy footfalls thud against the warped floorboards. The Wolf, looming in the doorway, bares his teeth and advances, blocking the exit. Grandmother brandishes the poker, voice trembling but loud: 'You’ll not frighten me out, beast.' The Wolf feints a lunge, sending the poker clattering aside, then seizes Grandmother’s wrists and shoves her into the corner, scanning the room for threats. Driven by the need to silence her quickly, he wraps her in a moth-eaten blanket, muffling her cries, and drags her behind the bed, scanning for Red’s imminent arrival. Rain beats harder against the window as the Wolf scans the cabin, preparing to set his trap."}}

She sets the basket down, her fingers lingering on the handle as she studies the figure in the bed—broad-shouldered beneath the patchwork quilt, hands tucked carefully out of sight. Red moves closer, offering the bread and soup, her tone measured as she remarks on Grandmother's odd voice and the size of her hands.

The scene ends with Red edging her chair just out of arm's reach, her eyes never leaving the shadowed face peering from beneath the bonnet."}}
