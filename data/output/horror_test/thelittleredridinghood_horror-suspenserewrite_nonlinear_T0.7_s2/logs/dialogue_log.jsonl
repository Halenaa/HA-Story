Grandmother, gaunt but alert, clutches a heavy iron poker, her knuckles white. The Wolf lets out a low, guttural growl, lips curling to reveal sharp teeth as he advances. Red snatches a kitchen knife from the table, the cold handle slick in her palm, and shouts, 'Stay away from her!' The Wolf whips around, meeting Red's gaze, and feints toward her, claws scraping gouges in the floor. Grandmother seizes the moment to jam the hot poker against the Wolf's leg, sending up a hiss of singed fur. The Wolf howls and staggers back, smashing the lamp. Glass shatters, oil spills, and smoke rises as the fire catches the edge of a blanket. Red grabs her grandmother's arm, hauling her toward the back door as flames lick up the wall. Rain-wind blasts their faces as they burst outside. Behind them, the Wolf's silhouette looms, snarling in the orange glow. Red drags Grandmother into the darkness of the trees, heart pounding, the taste of smoke and fear sharp in her mouth. They run, leaving the cabin burning and the Wolf's fury echoing in the night, their escape marked by the uncertainty of what comes next."}, "output": {"dialogue": []}}

Her eyes scanned the shadowed undergrowth ahead, alert for any sign of movement. Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a leaning birch: tall, broad-shouldered, with a dark coat blending into the shadows. The Wolf inclined his head in greeting, flashing a too-wide smile that revealed sharp, white teeth. 'Good evening, miss. Traveling alone?' he asked, his voice smooth but edged with hunger. Red paused, keeping a cautious distance. She shifted her weight, evaluating her options, her other hand slipping to the knife at her belt. But this time, Red met his gaze with open defiance. 'I know why you're here, Wolf. But you won't find what you're hunting on this path—not today.' The Wolf's smile widened, intrigued by her boldness. 'Perhaps not, Red—but every path has forks, and every traveler leaves a trail, even you.' Red narrowed her eyes, her stance unyielding. 'Maybe, but I've learned to cover my tracks—and I won't let you lead me astray.' The Wolf began to circle, his tone turning more predatory. 'Well, well... walking alone through my forest, are we? Not the wisest choice. Tell me, little one—where exactly do you think you’re headed?' Red refused to answer directly, her attention fixed on the nearest escape through the ferns, determined not to let him dictate her route. The Wolf's ears twitched, his attention sharpening as he assessed her wariness.

Inside, Grandmother, tending a simmering pot, hears the pane rattle. She snatches her iron poker from the hearth, stepping back as heavy footfalls thud against the warped floorboards. The Wolf, looming in the doorway, bares his teeth and advances, blocking the exit. Grandmother brandishes the poker, voice trembling but loud: 'You’ll not frighten me out, beast.' The Wolf feints a lunge, sending the poker clattering aside, then seizes Grandmother’s wrists and shoves her into the corner, scanning the room for threats. Driven by the need to silence her quickly, he wraps her in a moth-eaten blanket, muffling her cries, and drags her behind the bed, scanning for Red’s imminent arrival.

She knocks twice, listening to the muffled shuffle of feet inside and the scrape of a chair against the wooden floor. The Wolf, hidden beneath Grandmother's shawl, clears his throat and calls out in a rasping, unfamiliar tone for Red to enter. Red steps inside, her eyes quickly scanning the dimly lit room: the curtains drawn tight, a faint iron tang in the air, and a steaming mug left untouched on the table. She sets the basket down, her fingers lingering on the handle as she studies the figure in the bed—broad-shouldered beneath the patchwork quilt, hands tucked carefully out of sight. Red moves closer, offering the bread and soup, her tone measured and increasingly suspicious as she repeatedly remarks on Grandmother's odd voice, the size and shape of her hands, her teeth, and her eyes. Red's caution and quick-wittedness prompt her to voice these concerns directly, signaling her growing suspicion and wariness. The Wolf, maintaining his disguise but growing more insistent, responds with forced warmth and manipulative pleas for closeness, urging Red to sit beside him to facilitate his attack. Red, however, remains firmly out of reach, her suspicions mounting as she studies the shadowed face beneath the bonnet and refuses to approach, her body tensed for escape.
