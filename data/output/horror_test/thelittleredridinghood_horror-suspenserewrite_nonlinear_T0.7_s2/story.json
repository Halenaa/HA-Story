        "scene": "Night, inside Grandmother's cabin deep in the forest. The small wooden room is dim, flickering lamplight casting long shadows on the rough plank walls. Rain rattles against the glass, and the air is thick with the scent of damp earth and old wool. Floorboards creak under hurried footsteps; the fire hisses low in the hearth.",

        "plot": "Red stands pressed against the cabin door, breath sharp and shallow, as she watches the Wolf—a hulking, broad-shouldered figure cloaked in her grandmother's nightgown—prowl toward Grandmother's bed. Grandmother, gaunt but alert, clutches a heavy iron poker, her knuckles white. The Wolf lets out a low, guttural growl, lips curling to reveal sharp teeth as he advances. Red snatches a kitchen knife from the table, the cold handle slick in her palm, and shouts, 'Stay away from her!' The Wolf whips around, meeting Red's gaze, and feints toward her, claws scraping gouges in the floor. Grandmother seizes the moment to jam the hot poker against the Wolf's leg, sending up a hiss of singed fur. The Wolf howls and staggers back, smashing the lamp. Glass shatters, oil spills, and smoke rises as the fire catches the edge of a blanket. Red grabs her grandmother's arm, hauling her toward the back door as flames lick up the wall. Rain-wind blasts their faces as they burst outside. Behind them, the Wolf's silhouette looms, snarling in the orange glow. Red drags Grandmother into the darkness of the trees, heart pounding, the taste of smoke and fear sharp in her mouth. They run, leaving the cabin burning and the Wolf's fury echoing in the night, their escape marked by the uncertainty of what comes next.",

        "scene": "Late afternoon, along a narrow footpath deep in the mossy heart of the forest. Damp earth muffles Red's footsteps; ferns brush her knees and the air is heavy with the scent of pine and decaying leaves. Shafts of golden sunlight slant through the canopy, flickering across Red's red cloak as a distant woodpecker taps rhythmically.",

        "plot": "Red kept her basket close, tightening her grip on the handle as she stepped carefully over a tangle of exposed roots. Her eyes scanned the shadowed undergrowth ahead, alert for any sign of movement. Suddenly, a figure emerged from behind a leaning birch: tall, broad-shouldered, with a dark coat blending into the shadows. The Wolf inclined his head in greeting, flashing a too-wide smile that revealed sharp, white teeth. 'Good evening, miss. Traveling alone?' he asked, his voice smooth but edged with hunger. Red paused, keeping a cautious distance. She shifted her weight, evaluating her options, her other hand slipping to the knife at her belt. 'Just visiting my grandmother,' she replied, her voice steady, watching as the Wolf took a step closer, his gaze lingering on her basket. The Wolf sniffed the air, his nostrils flaring as he feigned polite curiosity. 'The woods are dangerous for the unwary,' he said, circling to block the path ahead. Red sidestepped, refusing to let him dictate her route, her attention fixed on the nearest escape through the ferns. The Wolf's ears twitched, his attention sharpening as he assessed her wariness. Each measured movement revealed their mutual awareness: Red, determined to protect her route and mission; the Wolf, intent on intimidation and learning her destination.",

        "plot": "The Wolf, hulking beneath a sodden black cloak, circles the cabin's rear, brushing against slick tree trunks and leaving muddy prints in the moss. He probes the window frames with clawed fingers, testing for weakness, then wedges a shoulder beneath the kitchen window and heaves it open with a low, guttural grunt. Inside, Grandmother, tending a simmering pot, hears the pane rattle. She snatches her iron poker from the hearth, stepping back as heavy footfalls thud against the warped floorboards. The Wolf, looming in the doorway, bares his teeth and advances, blocking the exit. Grandmother brandishes the poker, voice trembling but loud: 'You’ll not frighten me out, beast.' The Wolf feints a lunge, sending the poker clattering aside, then seizes Grandmother’s wrists and shoves her into the corner, scanning the room for threats. Driven by the need to silence her quickly, he wraps her in a moth-eaten blanket, muffling her cries, and drags her behind the bed, scanning for Red’s imminent arrival. Rain beats harder against the window as the Wolf scans the cabin, preparing to set his trap.",

Her mother stands by the window, peering into the fog-shrouded woods, then turns and places a folded letter beside Red’s bowl with a decisive gesture. She speaks in a low, urgent tone, instructing Red to deliver medicine and supplies to Grandmother, whose illness has worsened. As Red ties her cloak and packs the basket, her mother presses a cool hand to her shoulder, warning her to stay strictly on the path and avoid strangers. The clink of glass vials and the rough weave of the cloak’s fabric emphasize the careful preparations. Red nods, her resolve clear, shouldering the basket and stepping onto the dew-slick porch, the chill air biting her cheeks as she sets out toward the shadowed forest.",

She knocks twice, listening to the muffled shuffle of feet inside and the scrape of a chair against the wooden floor. The Wolf, hidden beneath Grandmother's shawl, clears his throat and calls out in a rasping, unfamiliar tone for Red to enter. Red steps inside, her eyes quickly scanning the dimly lit room: the curtains drawn tight, a faint iron tang in the air, and a steaming mug left untouched on the table. She sets the basket down, her fingers lingering on the handle as she studies the figure in the bed—broad-shouldered beneath the patchwork quilt, hands tucked carefully out of sight. Red moves closer, offering the bread and soup, her tone measured as she remarks on Grandmother's odd voice and the size of her hands. The Wolf, maintaining his disguise, flexes his clawed fingers beneath the covers and responds with forced warmth, urging Red to draw near. Red hesitates but leans in, watching for any sudden movement, her body tensed to bolt as she remarks on 'Grandmother's' unusual appearance. The Wolf, motivated to maintain his act long enough to strike, draws Red's attention with a crooked smile and invites her to sit closer. The scene ends with Red edging her chair just out of arm's reach, her eyes never leaving the shadowed face peering from beneath the bonnet.",
