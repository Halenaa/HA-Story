The original plot focused on quick preparations and silent observation, but the dialogue suggests immediate, tactical responses and readiness for direct confrontation. The updated plot incorporates these actions to reflect their increased agency and teamwork under threat.",

This deviates from the original plot, where Red is sent off alone and her mother bolts the door behind her. Updated plot reflects Red's mother accompanying her out of heightened caution.",
