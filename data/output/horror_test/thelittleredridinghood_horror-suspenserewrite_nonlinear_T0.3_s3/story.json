The rough-hewn floor creaks as Red drags a heavy oak chair to brace the door. Shadows flicker across the hearth, where dying embers throw a faint, acrid smoke into the air. Outside, branches scrape the windowpane, and the sharp tang of pine needles drifts through a broken shutter.",

        "plot": "Red, a slim girl with tangled hair and torn cloak, wedges a broom beneath the latch and stacks a kettle against the door, her movements quick and deliberate. Her grandmother, wrapped in a patchwork blanket, leans against the wall and hands Red a battered lantern, whispering, 'Check the window, child.' Red tiptoes to the window, wipes away condensation with her sleeve, and peers into the darkness, searching for any movement among the trees. The grandmother gathers a knitting needle, her gnarled fingers trembling as she positions herself behind the table, ready to defend her granddaughter. The two exchange short, urgent instructions, their voices low and tense, united in their determination to survive the threat lurking beyond the fragile wooden walls.",

Her mother, brisk and upright, pressed a rough-woven basket into her hands, the linen-wrapped contents still warm and fragrant with herbs and fresh bread. Without looking away, Red's mother gripped Red’s shoulder tightly and leaned close, her voice low and urgent: 'You must stay on the path, Red. Do not speak to anyone you meet in the woods. Go straight to Grandmother’s and come straight home.' Red shifted her weight, glancing toward the shadowed tree line, but her mother’s grip tightened. She pointed firmly down the narrow track, her eyes scanning the mist for movement. Red nodded, clutching the basket, and stepped away as her mother bolted the door behind her, the iron scraping against weathered wood. As Red set off down the rutted, pine-needle strewn path, a crow flapped overhead, its caw echoing through the trees. Each footstep pressed into the soft mud, marking the beginning of her journey.",

Driven by hunger, he tests the door with a clawed paw, finding it latched. He circles the cottage, sniffing at the cracked window, listening for movement inside. Hearing the soft coughs of Red's Grandmother, he rears up, scraping at the shutters with his teeth until the wood splinters. Inside, Red's Grandmother, pale and weak, hears the rattling. She pulls herself from her cot and wedges a stool against the door, voice trembling as she calls out, 'Who is there? Show yourself!' The Wolf, voice low and gravelly, mimics a hoarse whisper: 'It is I, your granddaughter, come to bring you comfort.' His tongue flicks over his yellowed teeth as he presses his ear to the door, waiting for the old woman to be fooled. But she does not open the door, instead gathering her shawl tighter and searching the room for something to defend herself with, knowing the woods hold more than one kind of danger. The Wolf, patience thinning, circles back to the rear window, preparing to force his way inside. The scene ends with the Wolf's claws tapping softly on the glass, as the last light dies behind the trees.",

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, brushing aside a low-hanging branch that leaves dew on her fingers. Suddenly, a large, gray-furred wolf emerges from behind a fallen log, his yellow eyes fixing on her with unsettling stillness. The Wolf lowers himself, tail flicking, and speaks in a smooth, almost human voice, 'Where are you going on this fine morning, little one?' Red hesitates, her hands tightening on the basket handle, eyeing the Wolf’s sharp teeth as he licks his lips slowly. Remembering her mother’s warnings, Red answers cautiously, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, just along the stream.' The Wolf pads a step closer, nostrils flaring as he sniffs the air, catching the scent of bread and honey. He cocks his head, feigning curiosity, 'Is your grandmother expecting you soon? The woods can be quite dangerous for a girl alone.' Red shifts her weight, glancing at the overgrown path ahead, and replies, 'I know the way. I’m not afraid.' The Wolf’s tail swishes in the undergrowth as he considers her, then he circles a patch of wildflowers, pretending to admire them, but his ears remain pricked, attentive. Red, uneasy, watches him closely, her own steps slowing. The Wolf, satisfied with her answers, decides to slip back into the ferns, his form nearly invisible in the dappled light, intent on reaching the cottage first. Red hurries her pace, determined to warn her grandmother, her footsteps crunching hurriedly on the gravel as she disappears around the bend.",

She knocks, clutching her basket, and hears a raspy voice beckon her inside. As she steps into the dimly lit room, Red scans the shadows, noting the unfamiliar rumpled blanket on her grandmother's bed. The Wolf, half-concealed beneath the covers, adjusts a lacy cap with one paw and turns his snout toward her, eyes glinting. He croaks, 'Come closer, child,' mimicking her grandmother's tone, though the words sound forced. Red inches forward, setting her basket on the table, and asks, 'Are you feeling better, Grandmother?' The Wolf fumbles with a teacup, spilling some onto the quilt, then replies, 'Much better, my dear. Sit with me.' Red hesitates, glancing at the creature's unusually large hands gripping the cup, and edges closer to the window, ready to bolt if needed. Her suspicion grows as she studies the figure's twitching nose and jagged teeth, but she moves slowly, trying to keep the impostor talking while she looks for signs of her real grandmother.",

A shadow shifted among the ferns; from behind a fallen log, the Wolf stepped out, his fur streaked with mud and his eyes glinting. He lowered his head, sniffing the air, and spoke in a smooth, coaxing tone, 'Such a clever girl—have you ever seen the wild violets off the main trail?' Red glanced toward the narrow deer track, torn between her mother's warnings and the Wolf's invitation. The Wolf flicked his tail, circling closer, and gestured with a paw toward the tangled undergrowth. Red, curiosity piqued and determined to bring a special gift for her grandmother, stepped off the main path, brushing past brambles that snagged her cloak. The Wolf watched her, tongue flicking over his teeth, before slipping silently ahead, his movements precise and predatory. As Red collected a handful of dew-laden blossoms, her boots sinking into the loam, the Wolf disappeared deeper into the shadows, his objective clear: reach the cottage before her. This detour, shaped by the Wolf’s manipulation and Red’s impulsive hope to please her grandmother, veered her fate toward danger.",

He lunged forward, snapping his jaws, but Red snatched a burning poker from the hearth and swung it desperately at his snout. The Wolf recoiled, yelping, as Red squeezed past him, her feet slapping against the hot, soot-streaked floorboards. She threw open the bedroom door and found her grandmother slumped by the bed, coughing hoarsely. Grabbing her grandmother around the shoulders, Red dragged her toward the window, splinters biting into her palms as she forced it open. Outside, the chill night air rushed in, thick with the smell of damp earth and distant rain. Flames roared behind them as Red hauled her grandmother onto the sill, determined to escape before the Wolf could recover and the fire consumed the house.",
