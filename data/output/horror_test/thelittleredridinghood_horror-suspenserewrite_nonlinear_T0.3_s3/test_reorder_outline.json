        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Horror Climax",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited perspective, past tense. Introduce Red and her grandmother as if the reader is meeting them for the first time.

Present Red's courage and the grandmother's support as an immediate, urgent dynamic.",

        "narrative_role": "Origin of the Quest",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited perspective, past tense. Provide context for Red's journey, her concern for her grandmother, and her mother's strict warning.

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, but briefly shift focus to the Wolf’s actions (still filtered through a limited perspective, avoid omniscient leaps). Present the Wolf as a shadowy, malevolent presence. Frame the chapter as a parallel thread, perhaps intercut with Red's journey, to maintain suspense and show the Wolf’s cunning.",
