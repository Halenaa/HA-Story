Go straight to Grandmother’s and come straight home.' Red shifted her weight, glancing toward the shadowed tree line, but her mother’s grip tightened. She pointed firmly down the narrow track, her eyes scanning the mist for movement. Red nodded, clutching the basket, and stepped away as her mother bolted the door behind her, the iron scraping against weathered wood.

Hearing the soft coughs of Red's Grandmother, he rears up, scraping at the shutters with his teeth until the wood splinters. Inside, Red's Grandmother, pale and weak, hears the rattling. She pulls herself from her cot and wedges a stool against the door, voice trembling as she calls out, 'Who is there? Show yourself!' The Wolf, voice low and gravelly, mimics a hoarse whisper: 'It is I, your granddaughter, come to bring you comfort.' His tongue flicks over his yellowed teeth as he presses his ear to the door, waiting for the old woman to be fooled. But she does not open the door, instead gathering her shawl tighter and searching the room for something to defend herself with, knowing the woods hold more than one kind of danger. The Wolf, patience thinning, circles back to the rear window, preparing to force his way inside.

The Wolf lowers himself, tail flicking, and speaks in a smooth, almost human voice, 'Where are you going on this fine morning, little one?' Red hesitates, her hands tightening on the basket handle, eyeing the Wolf’s sharp teeth as he licks his lips slowly. Remembering her mother’s warnings, Red answers cautiously, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, just along the stream.' The Wolf pads a step closer, nostrils flaring as he sniffs the air, catching the scent of bread and honey. He cocks his head, feigning curiosity, 'Is your grandmother expecting you soon? The woods can be quite dangerous for a girl alone.' Red shifts her weight, glancing at the overgrown path ahead, and replies, 'I know the way. I’m not afraid.' The Wolf’s tail swishes in the undergrowth as he considers her, then he circles a patch of wildflowers, pretending to admire them, but his ears remain pricked, attentive. Red, uneasy, watches him closely, her own steps slowing. The Wolf, satisfied with her answers, decides to slip back into the ferns, his form nearly invisible in the dappled light, intent on reaching the cottage first. Red hurries her pace, determined to warn her grandmother, her footsteps crunching hurriedly on the gravel as she disappears around the bend."}}
