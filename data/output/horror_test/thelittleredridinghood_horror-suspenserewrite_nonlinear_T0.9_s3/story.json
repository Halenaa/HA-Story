She sets the basket down on the scarred oak table and studies the figure propped in Grandmother's bed—features gaunt, voice rasping, hands hidden beneath the quilt. The Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, fixes Red with glinting eyes and beckons her closer, voice thick and forced. Red edges forward, feigning obedience while her gaze lingers on sharp nails poking from under the blanket. Red asks a pointed question about the missing herbal tea, watching the Wolf's jaw twitch. The Wolf leans forward, replying in a clipped tone, and shifts its weight, the quilt sliding to reveal a paw instead of a hand. Red fumbles for the heavy iron poker by the hearth, keeping her movement slow and measured to avoid detection. The Wolf's nostrils flare, catching the scent of sweat and rain on Red's cloak, and he tenses, readying to pounce if she turns her back. Both are locked in a standoff—Red, determined to protect her grandmother, and the Wolf, hungry and calculating, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.",

As she crouches to inspect them, a figure steps out from behind a cedar—tall, broad-shouldered, wearing a threadbare cloak that drips with rainwater. The stranger's eyes glint yellow for an instant before he smiles. Red straightens, keeping her distance, and grips the basket handle tighter. The Wolf—disguised as a weary traveler—greets her with a low, almost growling voice, asking where the path leads. Red answers cautiously, her gaze flicking from his muddy boots to his sharp, too-white teeth. The Wolf compliments her for traveling alone, then leans closer, sniffing the air subtly as if searching for a scent. Red steps back, pretending to adjust her hood, and asks why he's out here. The Wolf claims he's lost, but his eyes linger on her basket. Red, unsettled, decides not to reveal her destination, instead pointing him east toward the village and quickening her pace. The Wolf watches, his smile fading, before melting into the shadows between trees. Red listens for his footsteps, but hears only the distant caw of crows as she moves swiftly onwards.",

Driven by her need to protect herself and Red, she moves quietly to secure the bolt, her fingers trembling against the rough iron. The Wolf, motivated by hunger and the thrill of the hunt, shifts his form and calls out in a rasping, almost human voice, \"May I come in, old mother?\" Grandmother hesitates, recognizing the strange cadence, and edges toward the fireplace, gripping a heavy poker in preparation. The Wolf crashes through the door, splintering the wood with brute force. He circles the cabin, sniffing the air, his fur bristling, eyes gleaming with calculation. Grandmother swings the poker, clanging it against the Wolf's flank as he lunges, his jaws snapping inches from her arm. She stumbles backward, knocking over a stack of tin pans that clang across the floor, hoping to create enough noise to startle him or alert a passerby. The Wolf pauses, staring at her with cold intelligence, then growls, \"You are clever, old one. But I am hungry.\" As Grandmother blocks his path to the bedroom, she forces him to reveal his intent: he wants Red, and he wants the satisfaction of a clever chase. The Wolf, frustrated but intrigued, backs away momentarily, leaving the cabin in disarray and Grandmother gasping for breath as she quickly barricades the door, knowing he will return.",

She leans in, her voice low but urgent, warning Red to stay on the path and not to talk to any strangers. Red tightens her grip on the basket, meeting her mother’s gaze and insisting she can handle the journey alone. Red’s mother steps closer, brushing a strand of hair from Red’s forehead, her eyes scanning the woods visible through the window. She presses a silver whistle into Red’s palm, her fingers trembling slightly. Red tucks it into her pocket, squares her shoulders, and moves toward the door, determined to prove herself. As she steps onto the porch, the cold air bites her cheeks and the distant caw of a raven echoes from the treetops, foreshadowing the dangers that wait beyond the safe ring of the cottage.",

A faint rustle draws her attention—The Wolf, disguised as a tall, dark-haired traveler with a heavy cloak, steps from behind a tree, feigning a friendly smile. He nods toward the shortcut, suggesting in a lilting tone that it could save her time. Red narrows her eyes and shifts her weight, recalling her mother's warnings, but steps a pace closer, challenging his advice with a pointed question about the safety of the shortcut. The Wolf leans on his walking stick, gesturing smoothly toward the shadowed route, his voice low and persuasive, insisting he has used it himself many times without trouble. Red scans his face, catching the odd glint in his eyes, and fingers the handle of her basket, her mind racing as she weighs his suggestion against her own suspicions. A cold breeze stirs the leaves at their feet, carrying the sharp scent of pine sap as Red edges back toward the fork, her jaw set, decision hanging in the balance.",

Sensing danger, Red feigns a stumble and drops her scarf, using the distraction to dart off the main trail and into dense underbrush. The Wolf lunges after her, cloak snagging on thorns, his growl barely muffled. Red shoves aside brambles, scraping her arms, and scrambles up a mossy log, forcing herself toward a narrow animal track leading deeper into the woods. The Wolf pauses, nostrils flaring as he sniffs the air for her scent, lips curling in frustration. Red’s objective: escape pursuit and reach her grandmother’s cabin. Outcome: Red temporarily eludes the Wolf, but leaves clues of her passage, and the Wolf’s predatory interest intensifies.",

The Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, shifts under the covers, forcing a hoarse greeting: 'Come closer, child.' Red sets the basket down with a deliberate thud on the table, her fingers tracing the edge of a heavy iron pan. She asks pointed questions about Grandmother’s health, her eyes narrowing on the stranger’s unfamiliar movements and the musky, animal smell rising from the bed. The Wolf, calculating, drags a clawed hand beneath the quilt, watching Red’s hesitation and offering clipped, unnatural replies, eager to lure her closer. Red edges toward the bed, every step measured, her senses alert to the sour stench and the way the lamp’s light glints off a yellowing tooth. The scene ends with Red pausing just out of reach, her hand on the iron pan handle, voice steady as she demands to see Grandmother’s face.",

Red stands, blocking his path, and thrusts the poker at his chest, forcing him to snarl and recoil. Grandmother, motivated by her need to protect Red, distracts the Wolf by banging a tin cup against the iron bedstead, making a sharp metallic clang. The Wolf, torn between lunging at Red and silencing Grandmother, bares his teeth and lunges, claws scraping the wooden floor. Red swings the poker, connecting with his shoulder, while Grandmother hurls the lantern, flames licking up the Wolf's matted fur. The Wolf howls and stumbles toward the door, smoldering. Red slams the door shut and jams a chair beneath the handle as the Wolf flees into the stormy night, leaving scorched fur and the acrid scent of smoke behind. Grandmother, coughing, pulls Red into a tight hug as rain drums against the roof. Their coordinated defense forces the Wolf to retreat, securing their survival until morning.",
