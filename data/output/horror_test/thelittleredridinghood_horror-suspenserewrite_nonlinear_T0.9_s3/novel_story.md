# Chapter 7: The Deadly Deception

Red enters her grandmother's cottage, placing her basket on the table and immediately noticing something off about 'Grandmother.

' Sensing danger, she engages the Wolf—disguised as her grandmother—in a tense verbal exchange, focusing on the mysterious disappearance of the special herbal tea.

The Wolf, maintaining his charade but growing defensive, counters with evasive answers and subtle accusations.

Red presses him further, noting his nervous jaw twitch and hinting at her suspicions.

As the conversation intensifies, the Wolf's composure slips, revealing more of his true nature in both words and appearance.

Red folds her arms and fixes the Wolf with a steady, accusing stare, catching the subtle twitch of his jaw. "Wolf, you wouldn't happen to know what happened to Grandma's special herbal tea, would you? Strange how it vanished right after your last visit." ——Red

The Wolf shifts uneasily in his chair, glancing away to avoid Red's piercing gaze. "Well, Red, I suppose anyone could've taken it, but surely you don't think I'd stoop to pilfering tea?" ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, arms folded, while the Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing away. "Funny how you're suddenly so defensive, Wolf—makes me wonder what exactly you were brewing in Grandma's kitchen." ——Red

The Wolf's eyes narrow as he glances away, his tail flicking with irritation. "Perhaps you should be more concerned with what Grandma was hiding in that tea, rather than accusing me without proof." ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes and leans forward, scrutinizing the Wolf's reaction. "Maybe I would, if you didn't always seem to know more than you let on—especially with your jaw twitching every time I mention the tea." ——Red

The Wolf averts his gaze, his claws drumming nervously on the table as he avoids Red's piercing stare. "If you must know, Red, perhaps the reason my jaw twitches is because secrets weighed down by guilt—or by knowledge—tend to ache after a while." ——The Wolf

Red deliberately steers the conversation toward physical features, forcing the Wolf to respond in characteristically wolfish ways ('all the better to hold/see/eat you with').

The Wolf leans forward, the quilt pooling around its haunches. As it shifts, a thick-furred paw, claws half-retracted, slides into view from beneath the covers. "My, my, Red, you startled me. Is something the matter? You stare as if you've seen a ghost." ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, taking a cautious step back as she points to the paw peeking from beneath the quilt. "Grandmother, what big paws you have—I don't remember your hands ever being so. furry." ——Red

The Wolf quickly tucks the paw back beneath the quilt, forcing a smile that shows just a hint too many sharp teeth. "All the better to hold you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red steps closer, eyes narrowing, as the Wolf quickly tucks the paw back beneath the quilt. "Hold me? Grandmother, your voice sounds so gruff—are you feeling alright?" ——Red

The Wolf's ears twitch beneath the bonnet, and its eyes glint hungrily as it beckons Red nearer, claws curling under the edge of the quilt. "Why, yes, child, just a touch of the cold—come closer, let me see you better." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the bedside, her hand clutching her basket tightly as she peers at the Wolf's face. "Grandmother, your eyes—they look so fierce and yellow, not at all like yours." ——Red

The Wolf's lips curl back in a strained smile, sharp teeth glinting as the quilt slips lower, revealing more of its bristling fur. "All the better to see you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, her eyes widening as she takes a step back, clutching her basket tightly to her chest. "Grandmother, your teeth—why are they so sharp and long?" ——Red

The Wolf bares its teeth in a wicked grin, the quilt slipping further to reveal its muzzle, and Red instinctively recoils in shock. "All the better to eat you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

The standoff escalates as Red maneuvers closer to the iron poker, both aware that the moment of confrontation is near.

The dialogue reflects a battle of wits and suspicion, with Red cleverly probing and the Wolf alternating between deception and predatory threat, while the fate of Grandmother remains uncertain.

# Chapter 2: A Stranger in the Woods

Red walks along the muddy path, adjusting her basket to keep the jars steady.

She notices fresh paw prints and crouches to inspect them, wary.

Suddenly, the Wolf appears—a tall figure in a rain-soaked, threadbare cloak, his eyes briefly flashing yellow before he greets Red.

Instead of keeping her destination vague, Red openly shares that she is heading to her grandmother's cottage, even describing its location and mentioning her grandmother's solitude and frailty.

The Wolf asks probing questions about the grandmother, her habits, and security, and Red answers honestly, revealing details about the unlocked door and her identifying song.

Their conversation grows tense as Red shows suspicion and cautious wit, engaging in a verbal sparring match with the Wolf, who continues to press for personal information under the guise of neighborly curiosity.

The Wolf leans heavily on a crooked walking stick, his hat brim shadowing his eyes, giving the impression of exhaustion while his gaze flickers sharply over Red, measuring her. "Evenin', miss. You know these woods better than I do, seems—tell me, where does this path wind off to? My feet are near worn through, and I’d rather not get lost before dark." ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, eyeing the traveler’s shadowed face with polite wariness. "Oh, this path? It leads right through to my grandmother’s cottage, just past the old willow tree—but you best be careful, sir, the woods can play tricks on strangers." ——Red

The Wolf leans in subtly, eyes glinting with interest, as if mapping out the path in his mind. "Ah, your grandmother’s cottage, you say? Must be a cozy spot for shelter—does she live there alone, or might I expect company if I come upon it?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, eyeing the stranger warily as she steps a little further down the path. "Just my grandmother, sir—she prefers her solitude, though I was bringing her some supper to keep her company tonight." ——Red

The Wolf leans in slightly, eyes flickering with curiosity beneath his hood, as if measuring Red's response. "Kind of you to look after her—these woods can be a lonely place for the old or frail, wouldn’t you say?" ——The Wolf

Red glances warily at the traveler, tightening her grip on the basket as she steps a little further down the path. "Yes, I worry for her sometimes, especially since she hasn’t been feeling well lately and the forest seems darker than usual these days." ——Red

The Wolf leans in slightly, watching Red with keen, glinting eyes, feigning concern while probing for details. "A thoughtful gesture, indeed—if the forest grows darker, perhaps it’s wise to reach her swiftly; tell me, does your grandmother keep her door locked when she’s alone?" ——The Wolf

Red adjusts the basket on her arm, glancing warily at the stranger as a chill breeze rustles the leaves overhead. "She usually does, but she’ll unlock it when she hears my knock and my voice—she knows it’s me by the way I sing out her name." ——Red

The Wolf leans in slightly, his eyes glinting with a hidden curiosity, as if weighing each of Red's words. "Ah, a song to announce yourself—how charming; I suppose she’d open her door for no one else, then?" ——The Wolf

Red shifts her basket to the other arm, glancing at the stranger with a hint of suspicion as the shadows deepen around them. "That’s right, sir—she’s careful, but she always knows it’s me by the way I call to her, so she doesn’t worry." ——Red

Red maintains her independence and quick-thinking but is less secretive than in the original plot, providing the Wolf with information about her grandmother's situation.

Red tightens her grip on the basket, keeping a careful distance as she studies The Wolf’s muddy boots and the unsettling gleam of his teeth. "Long way from the deep woods, aren’t you? Not many folk pass through here at dusk." ——Red

The WolfRed tightens her grip on the basket, inching subtly backward as she studies The Wolf's grin. "Strange—I'd have thought the dark would keep most creatures in their dens, yet here you are." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, keeping a careful distance as she studies The Wolf's face for any flicker of intent. "Funny, I find the shadows safer than strangers with smiles too sharp for comfort." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, his eyes never leaving Red's face, the faintest hint of a grin curling at the edge of his mouth. "A wise instinct—sharp smiles often hide sharper hungers." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, edging subtly away while keeping her eyes locked on The Wolf. "Hunger’s one thing; intentions are another, and yours seem to track muddy footprints where they don’t belong." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, meeting her gaze with an unsettling steadiness, his grin never faltering. "Tracks can tell many stories, Red—sometimes the truth isn’t in the footprints, but in the eyes that notice them." ——The Wolf

Red shifts her weight subtly, keeping one hand close to the basket's handle as she watches The Wolf's expression for any flicker of menace. "Eyes see plenty, but not all that passes through is meant to be understood." ——Red

The WolfRed tightens her grip on her basket, her body angled subtly away as she watches The Wolf for the slightest movement. "Maybe, but even the darkest woods have paths worn by those who learned what shadows to trust—and which to avoid." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, standing square in the fading light, voice steady but low. "So which path brings you to my door, Wolf—the one you trust, or the one you hope I won’t notice?" ——Red

The Wolf leans forward, his gaze lingering on Red’s steady hands gripping the basket handle, a flicker of amusement curling at the corner of his mouth. "Perhaps I’m simply following the scent of curiosity, hoping to learn which doors open willingly—and which ones bite back." ——The Wolf

Red’s hand tightens around the basket at her side, her stance shifting just enough to block the threshold. "Curiosity can lead a beast straight into a hunter’s snare, if he isn’t careful where he sniffs." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting as he takes a slow step closer, testing the tension in Red's stance. "And a clever beast knows when the hunter’s hands are trembling on the bowstring." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket’s handle, jaw set as her eyes narrow, never leaving the Wolf’s face. "Sometimes it’s not the hunter’s hands that tremble, but the prey’s patience thinning with every step closer." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, the gleam in his eyes flickering between amusement and warning as he inches just close enough to test her resolve. "Patience is a fickle thing, Red—sometimes it snaps quietly, sometimes with teeth." ——The Wolf

Eventually, Red, feeling unsettled, points the Wolf toward the village and quickens her pace, determined to reach her grandmother swiftly.

The Wolf's lips curl into a sly smile as he leans in, nostrils flaring just enough to catch the scent that clings to Red's cloak, his gaze sharp and intent. "You know, not many dare to wander these woods alone. It takes a certain… spirit. Or perhaps you simply don't know what might be lurking beneath the trees?" ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her eyes flickering to the shadows behind the Wolf, uncertainty mingling with curiosity. "Thank you, I suppose—I’ve always liked the quiet here, though my mother says I should be careful of strangers." ——Red

The Wolf's gaze lingers on Red, lips curling in a faint, enigmatic smile as his nostrils flare, catching her scent. "Ah, wise advice—yet here you are, speaking to a stranger without a hint of fear." ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her gaze flickering from the Wolf’s eyes to the shadows behind him. "Maybe I’m just good at telling which strangers to trust—or at least which ones to be careful around." ——Red

The Wolf's gaze lingers, his smile widening just enough to reveal the edge of sharp teeth as he circles slowly, never quite breaking eye contact. "Trust is a delicate thing, little one—sometimes, the most dangerous creatures wear the friendliest faces." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze flickering between the Wolf's eyes and the shadowed path ahead. "I suppose that means I should keep my eyes open, even when someone offers a smile." ——Red

The Wolf tilts her head, gaze lingering on Red with a curious intensity, nostrils flaring as she inhales the girl's scent more deeply. "Indeed—but sometimes, the true intentions linger just beyond what the eyes can see." ——The Wolf

Red shifts her basket to the other arm, watching the Wolf’s face carefully, her posture a blend of curiosity and caution. "I guess I’ll have to listen closely, then, not just look." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, his gaze fixed on Red with a glint of amusement, his nostrils flaring ever so slightly as he inhales her scent again. "A wise approach—after all, the woods are full of secrets that only careful ears and clever hearts can uncover." ——The Wolf

The Wolf watches her leave, his interest piqued by the information gained, and disappears into the forest shadows.

Red steps back, her fingers tightening on the edge of her red cloak as she pretends to adjust her hood, keeping her eyes fixed warily on the Wolf. "You know, it's not often I see anyone else wandering this far from the path. What brings you out here, if you don't mind me asking?" ——Red

The Wolf's eyes linger on Red just a shade too long, a faint grin curling at the corners of his mouth. "Ah, sometimes the deeper woods offer. opportunities you can't find where everyone else treads." ——The Wolf

Red glances around, tightening her grip on her basket as she measures the distance back to the path. "Opportunities? That sounds a bit mysterious—what kind are you looking for?" ——Red

The Wolf's eyes glint as he tilts his head, watching Red closely, a faint smile curling at the edges of his mouth. "Let's just say I'm always interested in meeting those who stray from the ordinary trails—sometimes they have the most intriguing stories." ——The Wolf

Red shifts her basket to her other arm, keeping a cautious distance as she studies the Wolf's expression. "Stories can be dangerous things, especially out here—are you sure you're only interested in what people have to say?" ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting as he takes a slow step closer, the silence between them stretching taut. "Danger is only a matter of perspective—sometimes, it's the listener who shapes the story's end." ——The Wolf

Red tilts her head, tightening her grip on her basket and subtly edging a step away from the Wolf. "Maybe, but I like to know who my audience is before I share too much—are you sure you're just passing through?" ——Red

The Wolf's eyes glint as he takes a slow step closer, the underbrush whispering beneath his paws. "Let's just say I rarely pass through anywhere without a reason, Red—some company is worth lingering for." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze steady as she studies the Wolf's expression for any hint of his intentions. "Company can be more trouble than comfort, especially when you don't know what they're truly after." ——Red

The Wolf grins, stepping just close enough for his shadow to stretch across Red's path. "But isn’t it the unknown company that makes a walk in the woods memorable, Red?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, keeping the Wolf in her peripheral vision as she slowly resumes walking down the path. "Memorable, maybe—but sometimes memories are warnings we wish we'd listened to sooner." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, his gaze lingering on Red with a glint of challenge in his eyes. "And sometimes it's the warnings that make the story worth telling at all." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, her eyes scanning the shadows behind the Wolf. "Then I suppose we'll have to see what kind of story we're telling, won't we?" ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Grandmother's Struggle

Grandmother stands firm at the threshold, confronting the Wolf with unwavering resolve.

She refuses to let him pass, clearly stating her intent to protect Red and challenging his motives.

The Wolf, instead of immediately crashing through the door, engages in verbal sparring, expressing that his interest lies as much in the thrill of the chase as in the meal itself.

Grandmother counters his taunts, emphasizing her own experience and resilience.

This exchange escalates the tension, with the Wolf becoming increasingly intrigued by Grandmother's defiance.

Rather than launching a direct physical assault, the Wolf toys with the idea of a clever hunt, suggesting he might prefer outwitting both women over brute force.

Eventually, the Wolf withdraws for the moment, leaving the cabin in psychological turmoil, Grandmother determined but anxious, and Red forewarned of the Wolf’s cunning intent.

Grandmother quickly fortifies the cabin, knowing that the Wolf will attempt a more sophisticated approach when he returns.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning

Red stands at the table, tying a checkered cloth over a basket of bread and herbs.

Her mother paces nearby, folding a worn shawl and placing it in Red's hands.

She leans in, her voice low but urgent, warning Red to stay on the path and not to talk to any strangers.

Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, searching her daughter's face for understanding, her brow furrowed with worry. "Red, listen to me carefully. You must stay on the path, no matter what. And promise me you won't talk to anyone you don't know. There are dangers in these woods, more than you realize." ——Red's Mother

Red shifts her basket from one arm to the other, glancing toward the shadowy trees with a spark of curiosity in her eyes. "But Mama, what if I just say hello—what harm could that do?" ——Red

Red's MotherShe gently but firmly takes Red's hand, searching her eyes for understanding. "It's not just a simple hello, Red—sometimes talking to the wrong person can lead to trouble you can't imagine." ——Red's Mother

Red is initially uncertain, questioning why a simple greeting could be dangerous, but her mother insists the woods hold unpredictable threats.

Red squares her shoulders and holds the basket tight, her eyes steady and earnest as she looks up at her mother, determined to show she’s ready. "I promise, Mama, I can do this. I know the path through the woods by heart, and I’ll be careful. Please trust me." ——Red

Red's MotherShe gently tucks a loose strand of hair behind Red's ear, her fingers lingering as if reluctant to let go. "It's not that I don't trust you, Red, it's just that the woods hold more than winding paths—you must promise me you'll stay on them, no matter what." ——Red's Mother

Red lifts her chin, determination blazing in her eyes as she clutches the basket close to her chest. "I promise, Mama—I won't stray from the path, no matter what I see or hear." ——Red

Red, reassured by her mother's concern, promises more firmly than before that she will not stray from the path or talk to anyone she doesn't know.

Her mother, still anxious but comforted by Red's promise, presses a silver whistle into Red's palm.

Red tucks it into her pocket, squares her shoulders, and moves toward the door, determined to prove herself.

As she steps onto the porch, the cold air bites her cheeks and the distant caw of a raven echoes from the treetops, foreshadowing the dangers that wait beyond the safe ring of the cottage.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Shortcut's Temptation

Red stops at the fork, her grip tightening on the wicker basket.

She glances down the well-trodden main path, then studies the overgrown shortcut, brushing a nettle aside with her boot.

A faint rustle draws her attention—The Wolf, disguised as a tall, dark-haired traveler with a heavy cloak, steps from behind a tree, feigning a friendly smile.

He nods toward the shortcut, suggesting in a lilting tone that it could save her time.

The Wolf tilts his head with a courteous smile, gesturing gracefully toward the darker, narrow trail, his eyes glinting with a hint of something unspoken. "Now, my dear, if you’re truly in a hurry, might I suggest the little path just there? It winds so prettily through the trees and brings you out far sooner than that old, winding road. Why waste precious daylight when there’s a gentler way?" ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes and shifts her weight, recalling her mother's warnings, but steps a pace closer, challenging his advice with a pointed question about the safety of the shortcut.

Red narrows her eyes, her brow furrowing with doubt, yet she steps forward, arms crossed, her voice steady but edged with suspicion as she confronts the advice head-on. "You say it's the quickest way, but if that's true, why did my mother always tell me never to stray from the main path? What makes this shortcut so different?" ——Red

The Wolf leans on his walking stick, gesturing smoothly toward the shadowed route, his voice low and persuasive, insisting he has used it himself many times without trouble.

The Wolf taps his walking stick on the packed earth, a sly smile flickering at the corners of his mouth as he nods encouragingly toward the shadowed route. "Ah, don't let the darkness fool you. That path? I've walked it more times than I can count—never so much as a scratch. Trust me, it's the quickest, safest way through these woods, if you know where to step. And I do." ——The Wolf

Red scans his face, catching the odd glint in his eyes, and fingers the handle of her basket, her mind racing as she weighs his suggestion against her own suspicions.

A cold breeze stirs the leaves at their feet, carrying the sharp scent of pine sap as Red edges back toward the fork, her jaw set, decision hanging in the balance.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: The Wolf's Trap

Red strides quickly along the winding path, her basket clutched tight and boots sinking into mud patches.

She glances over her shoulder at the stranger trailing her, noting his unnaturally smooth gait and the way his eyes linger on her.

The Wolf, disguised in a battered cloak, mirrors her pace and suddenly veers closer, his voice low and coaxing, 'Is it safe for such a clever girl to walk alone?

' Sensing danger, Red feigns a stumble and drops her scarf, using the distraction to dart off the main trail and into dense underbrush.

The Wolf lunges after her, cloak snagging on thorns, his growl barely muffled.

Red shoves aside brambles, scraping her arms, and scrambles up a mossy log, forcing herself toward a narrow animal track leading deeper into the woods.

The Wolf pauses, nostrils flaring as he sniffs the air for her scent, lips curling in frustration.

Red’s objective: escape pursuit and reach her grandmother’s cabin.

Outcome: Red temporarily eludes the Wolf, but leaves clues of her passage, and the Wolf’s predatory interest intensifies.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Red Enters the Cabin

Red grips the basket tight, nudging open the warped cabin door with her boot.

She listens for her grandmother’s voice, but hears only the soft ticking of the mantle clock and a slow, deliberate breathing from the shadowed bed.

She steps inside, scanning the room, her eyes darting between the cluttered shelves and the figure beneath the quilt.

The Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, shifts under the covers, forcing a hoarse greeting: 'Come closer, child.

' Red sets the basket down with a deliberate thud on the table, her fingers tracing the edge of a heavy iron pan.

She asks pointed questions about Grandmother’s health, her eyes narrowing on the stranger’s unfamiliar movements and the musky, animal smell rising from the bed.

Red stands a cautious distance from the bed, her eyes flickering over the figure's hands and face, searching for familiar features. She wrinkles her nose at the unfamiliar odor, gripping her basket tighter as she waits for a reply. "Grandmother, are you feeling alright today? You seem. different somehow. Your voice sounds a little rough, and—have you changed your perfume? There's a rather odd scent in the room." ——Red

The Wolf, calculating, drags a clawed hand beneath the quilt, watching Red’s hesitation and offering clipped, unnatural replies, eager to lure her closer.

The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, the curve of a claw briefly scraping against the fabric, eyes glinting as they fix on Red, voice low and thick with false warmth. "Come closer, child. The shadows make it hard to see you. I wish to gaze upon your sweet face." ——The Wolf

Red edges toward the bed, every step measured, her senses alert to the sour stench and the way the lamp’s light glints off a yellowing tooth.

The scene ends with Red pausing just out of reach, her hand on the iron pan handle, voice steady as she demands to see Grandmother’s face.

Red stands at the threshold, knuckles whitening around the iron pan, her gaze fixed on the shadowed figure in the bed. Her voice is measured, but a tremor betrays her unease as she inches no further, ready to defend herself if the truth proves as terrible as she fears. "Show me your face, Grandmother. Now. I won’t come any closer until I see you, and hear your voice as I remember it." ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Final Confrontation

Red crouches by the hearth, gripping a heavy iron poker, her eyes fixed on the battered door.

Grandmother, hidden beneath a patchwork quilt, slides a small hatchet across the floor towards Red, her gnarled hands trembling.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl but his eyes glinting yellow, pushes the door open with a low growl and padded steps.

Red stands, blocking his path, and thrusts the poker at his chest, forcing him to snarl and recoil.

Grandmother, motivated by her need to protect Red, distracts the Wolf by banging a tin cup against the iron bedstead, making a sharp metallic clang.

The Wolf, torn between lunging at Red and silencing Grandmother, bares his teeth and lunges, claws scraping the wooden floor.

Red swings the poker, connecting with his shoulder, while Grandmother hurls the lantern, flames licking up the Wolf's matted fur.

The Wolf howls and stumbles toward the door, smoldering.

Red slams the door shut and jams a chair beneath the handle as the Wolf flees into the stormy night, leaving scorched fur and the acrid scent of smoke behind.

Grandmother, coughing, pulls Red into a tight hug as rain drums against the roof.

Their coordinated defense forces the Wolf to retreat, securing their survival until morning.
