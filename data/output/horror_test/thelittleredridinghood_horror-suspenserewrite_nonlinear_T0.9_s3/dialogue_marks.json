She sets the basket down on the scarred oak table and studies the figure propped in Grandmother's bed—features gaunt, voice rasping, hands hidden beneath the quilt. The Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, fixes Red with glinting eyes and beckons her closer, voice thick and forced. Red edges forward, feigning obedience while her gaze lingers on sharp nails poking from under the blanket. Red asks a pointed question about the missing herbal tea, watching the Wolf's jaw twitch. The Wolf leans forward, replying in a clipped tone, and shifts its weight, the quilt sliding to reveal a paw instead of a hand. Red fumbles for the heavy iron poker by the hearth, keeping her movement slow and measured to avoid detection. The Wolf's nostrils flare, catching the scent of sweat and rain on Red's cloak, and he tenses, readying to pounce if she turns her back. Both are locked in a standoff—Red, determined to protect her grandmother, and the Wolf, hungry and calculating, waiting for the perfect moment to strike.",

The stranger's eyes glint yellow for an instant before he smiles. Red straightens, keeping her distance, and grips the basket handle tighter. The Wolf—disguised as a weary traveler—greets her with a low, almost growling voice, asking where the path leads. Red answers cautiously, her gaze flicking from his muddy boots to his sharp, too-white teeth. The Wolf compliments her for traveling alone, then leans closer, sniffing the air subtly as if searching for a scent. Red steps back, pretending to adjust her hood, and asks why he's out here. The Wolf claims he's lost, but his eyes linger on her basket. Red, unsettled, decides not to reveal her destination, instead pointing him east toward the village and quickening her pace. The Wolf watches, his smile fading, before melting into the shadows between trees. Red listens for his footsteps, but hears only the distant caw of crows as she moves swiftly onwards.",

        "sentence": "Red crouches by the hearth, gripping a heavy iron poker, her eyes fixed on the battered door. Grandmother, hidden beneath a patchwork quilt, slides a small hatchet across the floor towards Red, her gnarled hands trembling. The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl but his eyes glinting yellow, pushes the door open with a low growl and padded steps. Red stands, blocking his path, and thrusts the poker at his chest, forcing him to snarl and recoil. Grandmother, motivated by her need to protect Red, distracts the Wolf by banging a tin cup against the iron bedstead, making a sharp metallic clang. The Wolf, torn between lunging at Red and silencing Grandmother, bares his teeth and lunges, claws scraping the wooden floor. Red swings the poker, connecting with his shoulder, while Grandmother hurls the lantern, flames licking up the Wolf's matted fur. The Wolf howls and stumbles toward the door, smoldering. Red slams the door shut and jams a chair beneath the handle as the Wolf flees into the stormy night, leaving scorched fur and the acrid scent of smoke behind. Grandmother, coughing, pulls Red into a tight hug as rain drums against the roof. Their coordinated defense forces the Wolf to retreat, securing their survival until morning.",
