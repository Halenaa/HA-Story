Red remains suspicious and independent, but is more forthcoming. The updated plot reflects this openness, showing the Wolf successfully extracting information while Red still attempts to maintain boundaries.",

Grandmother is more verbally confrontational and assertive than in the original plot, delaying direct physical violence in favor of a tense verbal standoff. The updated plot reflects this focus on psychological warfare and strategic buildup rather than immediate action.",

The original plot summary has Red confidently insisting she can handle the journey, but does not include this moment of doubt or her mother's repeated insistence. The updated plot integrates Red's momentary questioning and her mother's more detailed warning, aligning with the dialogue and reinforcing the logic of their relationship.",
