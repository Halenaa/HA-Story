# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Senses Danger

Red approached the crooked wooden door, her boots crunching over the gravel path as she balanced the wicker basket on her arm.

She rapped three times, the hollow sound echoing against the thick silence, then noticed the lace curtain twitch inside the fogged window.

The door swung open slowly to reveal 'Grandmother' lying in bed, her figure bundled tightly in blankets, face shadowed by a nightcap.

The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers and wearing Grandmother’s shawl, beckoned with a clawed hand hidden beneath the fabric, his voice rasping, 'Come closer, child.

' Red hesitated on the threshold, scanning the dim room for familiar sights—a pot of herbal tea simmered on the stove, but the usual scent of lavender was missing, replaced instead by a strange, musky odor.

She stepped forward, gripping the basket tighter, her eyes lingering on the shape beneath the quilt.

The Wolf, intent on deceiving her, adjusted the cap lower over his snout and shifted to mimic Grandmother’s frail cough, urging Red to set the basket on the table.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother’s nightcap and shawl, clasps the blanket closer and lets out a feeble, raspy cough, peering over the rims of the spectacles at Red with watery eyes. "Oh, my dear, just set your lovely basket right there on the table, won't you? My arms feel ever so tired today, and this old cough—ah, it leaves me quite weak." ——The Wolf

Red gently sets the basket on the table, studying 'Grandmother' with a touch of worry creasing her brow. "Of course, Grandmother—are you sure you're all right? You sound a bit different today." ——Red

The Wolf pats the bed with a shaky, gloved paw, eyes glinting beneath the shadow of the cap. "Oh, don't you fret, child—it's only this dreadful chill in my bones; come closer so I might see your sweet face better." ——The Wolf

Red obeyed, but kept her distance, her gaze darting uneasily between the figure in the bed and the door she left slightly ajar.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Invades Grandmother's House

The wolf, driven by hunger and the scent of fresh bread, prowls through the underbrush and circles the cottage.

He forces his way inside, confronting the frail Grandmother not with immediate violence, but with verbal intimidation and taunting, revealing his interest in her granddaughter Red.

Grandmother pleads for mercy and attempts to protect Red by warning her and standing up to the wolf.

The Wolf steps into the dim room, slinking toward the bed as Grandmother recoils, pressing herself against the headboard, her eyes wide with fear and confusion. "My, my, Grandmother—what a poor lock you keep. Did you think flimsy metal would keep me out? Come now, don’t tremble so. I’m only here for a little… conversation." ——The Wolf

Grandmother backs away, clutching the blanket tighter, her eyes wide with terror as she inches toward the corner of the bed. "W-what do you want from me, stranger? Please, let me be!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf advances, teeth glinting in the dim light, as Grandmother backs helplessly toward the wall, her hands shaking. "Ah, but you see, dearest, it's not you I truly want—it's your darling granddaughter, and you, I'm afraid, are simply in the way." ——The Wolf

Grandmother shrinks back against the headboard, clutching her blanket tighter as her hands tremble uncontrollably. "Please, spare me—I beg you, I have done nothing to deserve this!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his fangs, advancing with deliberate menace as Grandmother shrinks against the headboard, eyes wide in terror. "Deserve has nothing to do with it, old woman—step aside, or I’ll show you just how sharp my teeth can be." ——The Wolf

Grandmother shrinks back against the headboard, her knuckles white around the edge of her blanket as she searches desperately for something—anything—to shield herself. "Mercy, please—I'll do anything you ask, just don't hurt me!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf lunges forward, snatching the blanket from her trembling hands, his eyes glittering with cruel intent as he looms over her. "Mercy is a luxury I rarely indulge, Grandmother; now hush and let me slip into something more. convincing." ——The Wolf

The wolf delights in her fear, threatening her further and demanding her compliance so he can better deceive Red.

The WolfThe wolf snarls, saliva dripping from his fangs as he presses Grandmother harder into the floor. Grandmother trembles, eyes wide, clutching her shawl desperately as she gasps for breath, the basket overturned and its contents scattered around them. "You thought you could hide, old woman? There's nowhere left to run. Give me what I want, or I'll tear you apart." ——The Wolf

Grandmother twists beneath the wolf's heavy body, her eyes wide with terror as she gropes desperately for anything within reach to defend herself. "Stay back, you brute—there’s nothing here for you but trouble!" ——Grandmother

The WolfThe wolf presses his claws into Grandmother's shoulder, his eyes gleaming with hunger and menace. "Trouble is exactly what I crave—now, scream for your precious granddaughter before I silence you forever." ——The Wolf

Grandmother struggles beneath the wolf's crushing weight, her hands scrabbling desperately for anything within reach as the wolf's hot breath sears her cheek. "You monster—leave her out of this!" ——Grandmother

The WolfThe wolf presses harder, claws digging into Grandmother's arms as his hot breath rasps against her cheek. "Too late for mercy—she'll hear you beg before I feast." ——The Wolf

Grandmother struggles beneath the wolf's crushing weight, her voice shaking as she claws desperately at his fur, eyes darting toward the door in frantic hope for rescue. "No—please, not her! Take what you want, just spare the girl!" ——Grandmother

When Grandmother tries to warn Red with a shout, the wolf silences her—either by overpowering her or locking her away—before rifling through the cottage to disguise himself in Grandmother's clothes, preparing for Red's arrival.

Grandmother, voice trembling but resolute, lunges for the iron poker and swings it at the wolf’s side, her eyes blazing with fear and determination. As the wolf twists away, snarling, he grabs her roughly and drags her across the room toward the wardrobe, ignoring her desperate struggles and muffled shouts. "Red! Run, darling—he's here! Don't trust him, he's—" ——Grandmother

The Wolf clamps his jaws around Grandmother's arm, dragging her swiftly toward the wardrobe, his eyes glinting with satisfaction as he forces her inside and locks the door. "Ah, too late, old woman—your warning dies with you." ——The Wolf

Grandmother's voice trembles with both terror and determination as she pounds futilely against the inside of the wardrobe, her fists echoing in the small, shadowed room while the Wolf's grin widens, already turning toward the door to await Red's arrival. "You'll never keep her safe—she's cleverer than you think!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf presses his snout close to the wardrobe door, voice low and cold, then turns to neaten the bedclothes, erasing all trace of struggle. "But not quicker than my teeth, old one—she will come, and when she does, she’ll find nothing but your silence." ——The Wolf

# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Basket and a Warning

Red, her fingers still sticky from tying the basket’s twine, carefully packs a loaf of coarse bread and a sealed jar of soup into the wicker basket.

She inspects each item, pressing the linen cloth smooth before tucking it over the food.

Her mother stands by the hearth, ladling hot broth into a flask and wiping her hands on her apron.

She steps closer, places a firm hand on Red’s shoulder, and leans in to inspect the basket’s contents, her brow furrowed.

'Stay to the path, Red, and speak to no one you meet,' she instructs, her gaze sharp.

Red responds by tightening the knot securing the basket’s lid and nodding, gripping the handle with determination.

She glances out the window at the pale mist curling between the trees, eager but attentive to her mother’s warning.

The final outcome: Red, motivated by her concern for Grandmother and her wish to prove herself, sets off toward the forest path, her mother standing watchful in the doorway, the warning still echoing in the kitchen’s warm air.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Red Meets the Wolf

Red adjusted the wicker basket on her arm, brushing aside a drooping fern with her other hand as she followed the winding trail deeper into the woods, intent on reaching Grandmother's cottage before noon.

She paused to listen for the rustle of small animals, recalling her mother's warning, then bent to inspect a patch of violets for her grandmother.

Suddenly, the bushes ahead shivered and The Wolf stepped into the path, his silver-grey coat bristling and amber eyes fixed on Red.

He tilted his head, sniffed the air, and spoke in a low, measured voice: 'Good day, little girl.

Where might you be going all alone?

' Red straightened and tightened her grip on the basket, replying, 'I'm taking food to my grandmother.

She lives just past the bend.

' The Wolf's tail flicked as he circled Red at a careful distance, nose twitching as he sized her up.

He glanced toward a fork in the path, then nodded slyly, 'Such a dutiful granddaughter.

The woods are full of wonders.

Perhaps you should pick some flowers for her, too.

' Red, determined to finish her task but intrigued by the suggestion, hesitated and glanced at the wildflowers beside the trail, weighing the Wolf's words.

As she considered, The Wolf melted back into the shadows, his paws silent on the damp earth, leaving Red alone but unsettled.

The encounter shifted Red’s route, drawing her further from the main path and setting the stage for the events to come.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Huntsman

Red strode quickly along the winding path, clutching the basket tighter after her unsettling encounter with the wolf.

She ducked beneath a low-hanging branch, twigs scraping her cloak, determined to reach her grandmother's cottage.

Ahead, the rhythmic crunch of heavy boots on undergrowth halted her—The Huntsman, his coat flecked with mud and his hat shadowing sharp eyes, blocked her way, gripping his axe.

He scanned her, noting the basket and the direction she’d come from.

Red’s resolve was evident;

she insisted, 'I can't just stay here—my grandmother needs me.

She's all alone, and I promised I'd be there for her.

Red stands up quickly, her face a mix of worry and determination as she grabs her cloak from the chair. "I can't just stay here—my grandmother needs me. She's all alone, and I promised I'd be there for her. If I don't go now, what kind of granddaughter would I be?" ——Red

Red clenches her fists, her eyes shining with worry as she steps toward the door. "Every minute I wait, I feel like I'm letting her down, and I can't bear that." ——Red

If I don't go now, what kind of granddaughter would I be?

Red clenches their fists, taking a steadying breath as they stare ahead, determination flickering in their eyes despite the uncertainty before them. "I can’t turn back now. If I did, everything I’ve fought for would be wasted—the promises I made, the people depending on me… all of it gone. Even if I’m afraid, even if I doubt myself, I have to keep going. Turning back would mean accepting defeat, and I’m not ready to let go of what matters most." ——Red

' Her voice wavered with urgency: 'Every minute I wait, I feel like I'm letting her down, and I can't bear that.

' Though the Huntsman’s expression softened, he warned, 'You shouldn’t walk this path alone, not today.

' Red stood her ground, defiant and emotional: 'I can’t turn back now.

If I did, everything I’ve fought for would be wasted—the promises I made, the people depending on me… all of it gone.

Even if I’m afraid, even if I doubt myself, I have to keep going.

Turning back would mean accepting defeat, and I’m not ready to let go of what matters most.

' The Huntsman, recognizing her determination, lowered his axe and stepped aside, but cautioned, 'Stay to the path and don’t speak with strangers.

' Red nodded curtly and pushed past, her pace quickening, the huntsman watching her retreat with narrowed eyes, already searching the undergrowth for fresh tracks.

The encounter left pine needles crunching underfoot and the sun dipping lower, shadows lengthening as both pressed on, each driven by duty—hers to her family, his to the safety of the woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Red Fights Back

Red, gripping the heavy basket with both hands, edges slowly across the creaking floor, her eyes fixed on the figure in Grandmother's bed.

The Wolf, half-hidden beneath the patchwork quilt, stretches his clawed paw toward the bedside table, knocking over a tin cup with a metallic clatter.

He bares his teeth in a crooked imitation of a smile.

Red, recalling her mother's warnings and her grandmother's fragility, scans the room for anything she can use.

She spots the iron poker leaning near the fireplace and, feigning innocence, steps backward, her shoes scuffing against the splintered wood.

The Wolf, hungry and impatient, lunges from the bed, jaws snapping as he growls, 'Come closer, little one.

' Red ducks aside, seizes the poker, and swings it upward, striking the Wolf's shoulder.

The Wolf recoils, fur bristling, and circles to cut off her escape, snarling, 'You clever morsel, but you won't get far.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: Huntsman Arrives and Final Confrontation

Red, holding her wicker basket, stands by the bed, engaging in a tense exchange with the Wolf disguised as her grandmother, questioning his features as the classic ruse unfolds.

Red tightens her grip on her wicker basket, inching closer to the bed, her brow furrowing as she studies the unfamiliar gleam in 'Grandmother's' eyes. "Grandmother, what big eyes you have." ——Red

The Wolf's yellow eyes glint hungrily from beneath the shadowed bonnet as he leans closer, his claws twitching beneath the covers. "All the better to see you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red tilts her head, her grip on the basket tightening as she takes a wary step closer, studying the figure on the bed. "And Grandmother, what big ears you have." ——Red

The Wolf's voice grows rougher, his ears twitching beneath the quilt as he leans closer, eyes glinting with hunger. "All the better to hear you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Before the Wolf can strike, the door bursts open;

the Huntsman enters, axe in hand, and immediately confronts the Wolf with authoritative threats.

The Wolf, unafraid, taunts the Huntsman and asserts his willingness to fight, making it clear he will not surrender easily and negotiating for an escape through the window.

The Huntsman stands firm, warning the Wolf and offering a chance for surrender, but the Wolf refuses, ready to attempt an escape or a fight.

The Huntsman plants his feet firmly, raising his axe high, eyes fixed on the Wolf as he moves forward with unwavering resolve. "Back, foul creature! I warn you—take another step toward the girl, and you'll feel the bite of my steel. This forest will not shelter your evil tonight." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares its fangs, crouching low, muscles coiled as it circles warily, refusing to yield ground. "You think your blade frightens me, huntsman? I've tasted steel before—and tonight, I'll taste victory." ——The Wolf

The HuntsmanHe lunges forward, swinging the axe in a wide arc to force the Wolf further from the trembling girl. "The Huntsman: Your arrogance blinds you, beast—justice hunts you now, and I will not falter!" ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares his fangs, muscles tensing, and lunges forward with a snarling leap. "Then come, huntsman—let’s see if your courage matches your threats!" ——The Wolf

Red, meanwhile, remains alert for her grandmother, but the focus remains on the standoff between the Wolf and the Huntsman, heightening the tension and setting the stage for a decisive confrontation.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Rescue and Aftermath

Red kneels by her grandmother's bedside, smoothing the wrinkled sheet with shaking fingers and helping her sip water from a chipped mug.

The Huntsman stands nearby, checking the sturdiness of the door after repairing it, his boots tracking in fresh mud.

Grandmother, propped up on her pillows, thanks the Huntsman in a trembling voice, then reaches out to clasp Red's hand.

Grandmother, her hands still shaking, clasps Red’s hand tightly and pulls her granddaughter close, her eyes shining with tears of relief and love. "Oh, thank you, dear Huntsman. you saved us—both of us. I don’t know how to ever repay your courage." ——Grandmother

Red squeezes Grandmother's hand tightly, tears of relief welling in her eyes. "Oh, Grandmother—I was so scared, but now that you’re safe, I feel like I can finally breathe again." ——Red

The HuntsmanGrandmother squeezes Red's hand tightly, her eyes shining with grateful tears as she looks from Red to the Huntsman. "We have been given a second chance, my dear, and I thank you, Huntsman, from the bottom of my heart." ——The Huntsman

Red carefully gathers the scattered belongings from the floor and sets the basket of bread and honey on the bedside table, glancing at the Huntsman for reassurance.

The Huntsman nods, urging Red to speak up, and Red promises to heed warnings and visit only when it is safe.

The Huntsman fixes Red with a steady, serious gaze, his tone gentle but firm, making sure she understands the gravity of the situation. "Red, these woods are not always as quiet as they seem. Promise me you'll remember my warnings—and that you'll only come this way when it's safe." ——The Huntsman

Red meets the Huntsman's gaze, her tone earnest and steady, showing she takes the promise seriously. "I understand, Huntsman—I promise I’ll remember your warnings and only come through the woods when I know it’s safe." ——Red

Outside, the wind rattles the window panes as the Huntsman gathers his axe and prepares to report the wolf’s fate to the village elders, while Red tucks the blankets securely around her grandmother, determined to watch over her through the night.
