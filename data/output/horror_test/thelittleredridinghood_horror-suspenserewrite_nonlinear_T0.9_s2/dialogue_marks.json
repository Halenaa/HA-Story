She rapped three times, the hollow sound echoing against the thick silence, then noticed the lace curtain twitch inside the fogged window. The door swung open slowly to reveal 'Grandmother' lying in bed, her figure bundled tightly in blankets, face shadowed by a nightcap. The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers and wearing Grandmother’s shawl, beckoned with a clawed hand hidden beneath the fabric, his voice rasping, 'Come closer, child.' Red hesitated on the threshold, scanning the dim room for familiar sights—a pot of herbal tea simmered on the stove, but the usual scent of lavender was missing, replaced instead by a strange, musky odor. She stepped forward, gripping the basket tighter, her eyes lingering on the shape beneath the quilt. The Wolf, intent on deceiving her, adjusted the cap lower over his snout and shifted to mimic Grandmother’s frail cough, urging Red to set the basket on the table. Red obeyed, but kept her distance, her gaze darting uneasily between the figure in the bed and the door she left slightly ajar.",

With a calculated shove, he forced the latch, slipping inside as Grandmother struggled from her bed, clutching her blanket. The wolf lunged, knocking a basket aside and pinning her with his weight, his jaws snapping inches from her face. Grandmother, motivated by the urge to warn Red, reached for the iron poker and struck at the wolf’s flank, but he twisted, seized her, and dragged her toward the wardrobe, stuffing her inside and barring the door before scanning the room for evidence of struggle.

The woods are full of wonders. Perhaps you should pick some flowers for her, too.'
