The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers and wearing Grandmother’s shawl, beckoned with a clawed hand hidden beneath the fabric, his voice rasping, 'Come closer, child.'

Suddenly, the bushes ahead shivered and The Wolf stepped into the path, his silver-grey coat bristling and amber eyes fixed on Red. He tilted his head, sniffed the air, and spoke in a low, measured voice: 'Good day, little girl. Where might you be going all alone?' Red straightened and tightened her grip on the basket, replying, 'I'm taking food to my grandmother. She lives just past the bend.' The Wolf's tail flicked as he circled Red at a careful distance, nose twitching as he sized her up. He glanced toward a fork in the path, then nodded slyly, 'Such a dutiful granddaughter. The woods are full of wonders. Perhaps you should pick some flowers for her, too.' Red, determined to finish her task but intrigued by the suggestion, hesitated and glanced at the wildflowers beside the trail, weighing the Wolf's words. As she considered, The Wolf melted back into the shadows, his paws silent on the damp earth, leaving Red alone but unsettled.

She ducked beneath a low-hanging branch, twigs scraping her cloak, determined to reach her grandmother's cottage. Ahead, the rhythmic crunch of heavy boots on undergrowth halted her—The Huntsman, his coat flecked with mud and his hat shadowing sharp eyes, blocked her way, gripping his axe. He scanned her, noting the basket and the direction she’d come from. Red’s resolve was evident; she insisted, 'I can't just stay here—my grandmother needs me. She's all alone, and I promised I'd be there for her. If I don't go now, what kind of granddaughter would I be?' Her voice wavered with urgency: 'Every minute I wait, I feel like I'm letting her down, and I can't bear that.' Though the Huntsman’s expression softened, he warned, 'You shouldn’t walk this path alone, not today.' Red stood her ground, defiant and emotional: 'I can’t turn back now. If I did, everything I’ve fought for would be wasted—the promises I made, the people depending on me… all of it gone. Even if I’m afraid, even if I doubt myself, I have to keep going. Turning back would mean accepting defeat, and I’m not ready to let go of what matters most.' The Huntsman, recognizing her determination, lowered his axe and stepped aside, but cautioned, 'Stay to the path and don’t speak with strangers.' Red nodded curtly and pushed past, her pace quickening, the huntsman watching her retreat with narrowed eyes, already searching the undergrowth for fresh tracks.
