The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers and wearing Grandmother’s shawl, beckoned with a clawed hand hidden beneath the fabric, his voice rasping, 'Come closer, child.' Red hesitated on the threshold, scanning the dim room for familiar sights—a pot of herbal tea simmered on the stove, but the usual scent of lavender was missing, replaced instead by a strange, musky odor. She stepped forward, gripping the basket tighter, her eyes lingering on the shape beneath the quilt. The Wolf, intent on deceiving her, adjusted the cap lower over his snout and shifted to mimic Grandmother’s frail cough, urging Red to set the basket on the table.

Red straightened and tightened her grip on the basket, replying, 'I'm taking food to my grandmother. She lives just past the bend.' The Wolf's tail flicked as he circled Red at a careful distance, nose twitching as he sized her up. He glanced toward a fork in the path, then nodded slyly, 'Such a dutiful granddaughter. The woods are full of wonders. Perhaps you should pick some flowers for her, too.' Red, determined to finish her task but intrigued by the suggestion, hesitated and glanced at the wildflowers beside the trail, weighing the Wolf's words.

He scanned her, noting the basket and the direction she’d come from. 'You shouldn’t walk this path alone, not today,' he said, voice gruff. Red stepped back instinctively, eyeing the axe warily, but stood her ground. 'My grandmother needs me. I can’t turn back now.'
