Unlike the original plot summary, which quickly described the physical struggle and Grandmother's attempt to fight back with the poker, the dialogue focuses on psychological confrontation, Grandmother's verbal resistance, and her attempt to warn Red vocally. The updated plot reflects this by emphasizing the verbal exchange, threats, and Grandmother's vocal warning, before the wolf subdues her and prepares his disguise.",

The dialogue suggests a tense parley, with the Wolf refusing to back down or flee immediately and the Huntsman trying to assert dominance and offer mercy, rather than instantly engaging in physical combat or blocking the Wolf's escape.
