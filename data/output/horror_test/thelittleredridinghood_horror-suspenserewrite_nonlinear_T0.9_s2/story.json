        "plot": "Red approached the crooked wooden door, her boots crunching over the gravel path as she balanced the wicker basket on her arm. She rapped three times, the hollow sound echoing against the thick silence, then noticed the lace curtain twitch inside the fogged window. The door swung open slowly to reveal 'Grandmother' lying in bed, her figure bundled tightly in blankets, face shadowed by a nightcap. The Wolf, concealed beneath the covers and wearing Grandmother’s shawl, beckoned with a clawed hand hidden beneath the fabric, his voice rasping, 'Come closer, child.' Red hesitated on the threshold, scanning the dim room for familiar sights—a pot of herbal tea simmered on the stove, but the usual scent of lavender was missing, replaced instead by a strange, musky odor. She stepped forward, gripping the basket tighter, her eyes lingering on the shape beneath the quilt. The Wolf, intent on deceiving her, adjusted the cap lower over his snout and shifted to mimic Grandmother’s frail cough, urging Red to set the basket on the table. Red obeyed, but kept her distance, her gaze darting uneasily between the figure in the bed and the door she left slightly ajar.",

He circled the cottage, ears pricked for movement, then pressed his muzzle against the door, catching the aroma of herbs and illness. With a calculated shove, he forced the latch, slipping inside as Grandmother struggled from her bed, clutching her blanket. The wolf lunged, knocking a basket aside and pinning her with his weight, his jaws snapping inches from her face. Grandmother, motivated by the urge to warn Red, reached for the iron poker and struck at the wolf’s flank, but he twisted, seized her, and dragged her toward the wardrobe, stuffing her inside and barring the door before scanning the room for evidence of struggle. The wolf then ransacked the shelves, searching for a shawl and spectacles, preparing to impersonate her before Red’s imminent arrival.",

She inspects each item, pressing the linen cloth smooth before tucking it over the food. Her mother stands by the hearth, ladling hot broth into a flask and wiping her hands on her apron. She steps closer, places a firm hand on Red’s shoulder, and leans in to inspect the basket’s contents, her brow furrowed. 'Stay to the path, Red, and speak to no one you meet,' she instructs, her gaze sharp. Red responds by tightening the knot securing the basket’s lid and nodding, gripping the handle with determination. She glances out the window at the pale mist curling between the trees, eager but attentive to her mother’s warning. The final outcome: Red, motivated by her concern for Grandmother and her wish to prove herself, sets off toward the forest path, her mother standing watchful in the doorway, the warning still echoing in the kitchen’s warm air.",

She paused to listen for the rustle of small animals, recalling her mother's warning, then bent to inspect a patch of violets for her grandmother. Suddenly, the bushes ahead shivered and The Wolf stepped into the path, his silver-grey coat bristling and amber eyes fixed on Red. He tilted his head, sniffed the air, and spoke in a low, measured voice: 'Good day, little girl. Where might you be going all alone?' Red straightened and tightened her grip on the basket, replying, 'I'm taking food to my grandmother. She lives just past the bend.' The Wolf's tail flicked as he circled Red at a careful distance, nose twitching as he sized her up. He glanced toward a fork in the path, then nodded slyly, 'Such a dutiful granddaughter. The woods are full of wonders. Perhaps you should pick some flowers for her, too.' Red, determined to finish her task but intrigued by the suggestion, hesitated and glanced at the wildflowers beside the trail, weighing the Wolf's words. As she considered, The Wolf melted back into the shadows, his paws silent on the damp earth, leaving Red alone but unsettled. The encounter shifted Red’s route, drawing her further from the main path and setting the stage for the events to come.",

She ducked beneath a low-hanging branch, twigs scraping her cloak, determined to reach her grandmother's cottage. Ahead, the rhythmic crunch of heavy boots on undergrowth halted her—The Huntsman, his coat flecked with mud and his hat shadowing sharp eyes, blocked her way, gripping his axe. He scanned her, noting the basket and the direction she’d come from. 'You shouldn’t walk this path alone, not today,' he said, voice gruff. Red stepped back instinctively, eyeing the axe warily, but stood her ground. 'My grandmother needs me. I can’t turn back now.' The Huntsman tilted his head, scenting the air—faint traces of wolf lingered. He lowered the axe and stepped aside, but warned, 'Stay to the path and don’t speak with strangers.' Red nodded curtly and pushed past, her pace quickening, the huntsman watching her retreat with narrowed eyes, already searching the undergrowth for fresh tracks. The encounter left pine needles crunching underfoot and the sun dipping lower, shadows lengthening as both pressed on, each driven by duty—hers to her family, his to the safety of the woods.",

He bares his teeth in a crooked imitation of a smile. Red, recalling her mother's warnings and her grandmother's fragility, scans the room for anything she can use. She spots the iron poker leaning near the fireplace and, feigning innocence, steps backward, her shoes scuffing against the splintered wood. The Wolf, hungry and impatient, lunges from the bed, jaws snapping as he growls, 'Come closer, little one.' Red ducks aside, seizes the poker, and swings it upward, striking the Wolf's shoulder. The Wolf recoils, fur bristling, and circles to cut off her escape, snarling, 'You clever morsel, but you won't get far.'",
