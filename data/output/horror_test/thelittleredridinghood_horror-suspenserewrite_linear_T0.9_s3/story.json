Red's mother closes the basket with a firm snap, then grasps Red's wrist, her eyes scanning the shadows at the forest's edge. She warns, 'Stay on the path, Red. Do not stray, no matter what you hear.' Red pulls her hand free, insisting she knows the way, but her mother steps closer, lowering her voice. 'The Wolf has been seen again. Promise me.' Red shifts the basket in her grip, glancing toward the sunlit sliver between the trees, and nods. Her mother presses the basket into Red's hands, brushing stray flour from her own apron, and watches as Red steps onto the narrow footpath leading into the woods. Birds scatter from the branches overhead as Red takes her first steps, the crunch of gravel loud beneath her boots.",

Her mother, standing just outside their cottage, blocks Red's way, placing a firm hand on her shoulder and urging her to reconsider venturing into the woods alone. Red insists she can handle the journey, pointing to the basket and promising to stay on the path. Her mother, motivated by worry and caution, reluctantly removes her hand but presses a red cloak around Red's shoulders, instructing her to keep it visible as a warning to predators.

The Wolf, hidden behind a cluster of brambles, watches her progress, calculating her vulnerability. He slinks forward, flattening himself to the ground to avoid detection, then emerges suddenly onto the path ahead of Red, adopting a gentle tone and asking where she is headed. Red, motivated by her desire to help her grandmother, answers boldly but keeps her grip tight on the basket. The Wolf, motivated by hunger, nods and suggests a shortcut through a thicket, pointing with his snout. Red hesitates, scanning the undergrowth and noticing fresh claw marks on a nearby tree, then decides to continue on the main path, ignoring the Wolf's suggestion. The Wolf retreats into the shadows, licking his jaws and planning to intercept her further down the trail.",

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from the shadows between two gnarled trees, his fur bristling and nose twitching as he sniffs the air. The Wolf blocks the path, lowering his head as if in greeting. He speaks with a slow, deliberate cadence, 'Where are you off to, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red, determined to appear brave, stands tall and replies, 'I'm bringing food to my sick grandmother.' The Wolf’s eyes narrow as he circles her, tail flicking, and suggests a shortcut, pointing his snout toward a faint trail. Red hesitates but grips her basket tighter, declining his offer and insisting she knows her way. The Wolf watches her with calculated patience as she steps around him and continues down the path, while he slips silently into the undergrowth, planning his next move.

Inside, Grandmother rises shakily from her bed, clutching her shawl, and shuffles to the door, her voice quavering as she calls out, 'Who is it at this hour?' The Wolf, voice low and gruff, answers, 'It's Red, I've brought you breakfast.' Grandmother hesitates, then unlatches the door, only to have the Wolf shove it open, knocking her backwards. He lunges, teeth flashing, as she grabs a poker from the hearth and swings at his muzzle, managing to graze his snout before he overpowers her and drags her toward the bed. The Wolf glances at the red cloak hanging on a peg by the door, eyes narrowing as he considers his next move.",

Red steps inside, noting the unfamiliar, musky odor and the heavy silence, her eyes adjusting to the gloom. She sets the basket on the wobbly table and cautiously advances, squinting at the figure in bed. The Wolf pats the coverlet with a claw hidden under a blanket, beckoning Red closer. Red, motivated to help her grandmother, moves toward the bed, clutching a jar of honey, while the Wolf, driven by hunger and anticipation, tightens his grip on the sheet, preparing to spring. Their dialogue is clipped and tense, with Red asking, 'Grandmother, why is your voice so rough?' and the Wolf replying, 'The cold, child. Come nearer.' The scene ends with Red hesitantly sitting on the edge of the bed, the Wolf inching closer, both locked in a tense standoff as Red studies the shadowed face before her.",

The Wolf, using a raspy, imitated voice, beckons Red closer by patting the bed and says, 'Come nearer, child, so I may see you better.' Red hesitates, glancing at the strange, musky scent in the air and the sharp glint of the Wolf's yellowed teeth peeking from beneath the covers. She edges nearer, reaching out to touch the Wolf's paw, frowning at its coarse texture. The Wolf shifts, tightening his grip on the blanket, and prepares to spring. The objective is for Red to realize something is wrong, while the Wolf maneuvers her into striking distance.

He scans the scene, identifies the Wolf, and shouts, 'Step away from the girl!' The Wolf snarls and leaps from the bed, claws slicing through the air, but the Huntsman swings his axe, driving the beast back against the hearth. Red darts behind the table, knocking over a tin cup that clatters to the floor. The Wolf, cornered and desperate, bares his fangs at the Huntsman, who stands firm between the beast and Red, determined to protect her and eliminate the threat.
