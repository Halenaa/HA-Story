Red's mother closes the basket with a firm snap, then grasps Red's wrist, her eyes scanning the shadows at the forest's edge. She warns, 'Stay on the path, Red. Do not stray, no matter what you hear.' Red pulls her hand free, insisting she knows the way, but her mother steps closer, lowering her voice. 'The Wolf has been seen again. Promise me.' Red shifts the basket in her grip, glancing toward the sunlit sliver between the trees, and nods. Her mother presses the basket into Red's hands, brushing stray flour from her own apron, and watches as Red steps onto the narrow footpath leading into the woods. Birds scatter from the branches overhead as Red takes her first steps, the crunch of gravel loud beneath her boots.",

Her mother, standing just outside their cottage, intercepts her, more insistent than before, expressing heightened concern about wolves prowling near the old path. Red's mother pleads with Red to wait for her father or let her accompany Red, but Red insists she cannot delay, emphasizing her promise to her grandmother and her familiarity with the woods. After several heartfelt exchanges, Red’s mother reluctantly relents, pressing a red cloak onto Red's shoulders and making her promise to keep it visible as a warning to predators and as a sign of protection. Red reassures her mother, promising to stay on the path, keep her cloak on, and heed her mother's warnings. Her mother gives final reminders about not talking to strangers and hovers anxiously as Red walks beneath the trees, watching for danger and listening to the forest sounds.",

Red, motivated by her desire to help her grandmother, answers boldly but keeps her grip tight on the basket. The Wolf, motivated by hunger, nods and suggests a shortcut through a thicket, pointing with his snout. Red hesitates, scanning the undergrowth and noticing fresh claw marks on a nearby tree, then decides to continue on the main path, ignoring the Wolf's suggestion. The Wolf retreats into the shadows, licking his jaws and planning to intercept her further down the trail.",

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from the shadows between two gnarled trees, his fur bristling and nose twitching as he sniffs the air. The Wolf blocks the path, lowering his head as if in greeting. He speaks with a slow, deliberate cadence, 'Where are you off to, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red, determined to appear brave, stands tall and replies, 'I'm bringing food to my sick grandmother.' The Wolf’s eyes narrow as he circles her, tail flicking, and suggests a shortcut, pointing his snout toward a faint trail. Red hesitates but grips her basket tighter, declining his offer and insisting she knows her way. The Wolf watches her with calculated patience as she steps around him and continues down the path, while he slips silently into the undergrowth, planning his next move.

Inside, Grandmother rises shakily from her bed, clutching her shawl, and shuffles to the door, her voice quavering as she calls out, 'Who is it at this hour?' The Wolf, voice low and gruff, answers, 'It's Red, I've brought you breakfast.' Grandmother hesitates, then unlatches the door, only to have the Wolf shove it open, knocking her backwards. He lunges, teeth flashing, as she grabs a poker from the hearth and swings at his muzzle, managing to graze his snout before he overpowers her and drags her toward the bed.

The Wolf, with a clawed hand hidden under blankets, beckons her closer. The conversation turns unsettling: after Red inquires about the roughness of the voice, the Wolf elaborates ominously about the cold that seeps into bones, then tries repeatedly to coax Red closer, using soothing yet insistent words, emphasizing warmth and safety and urging her to come within reach. Red, sensing unease but driven by concern, inches forward, the tension mounting as the Wolf grows more persuasive and intent on drawing her near.
