# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning

Red stands at the threshold of the cottage, tying her crimson cloak around her shoulders while her mother packs a wicker basket with fresh bread and a jar of honey.

Red's mother closes the basket with a firm snap, then grasps Red's wrist, her eyes scanning the shadows at the forest's edge.

She warns, 'Stay on the path, Red.

Do not stray, no matter what you hear.

' Red pulls her hand free, insisting she knows the way, but her mother steps closer, lowering her voice.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red straightens her cloak and lifts her chin, determination shining in her eyes as she steps back from her mother's grasp. "I promise, I know the path by heart, Mother. I don't need anyone to hold my hand every step of the way." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe gently places a hand on Red's shoulder, her eyes searching her daughter's face for understanding. "Knowing the path isn't the same as knowing what waits among the trees, Red." ——Red's Mother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red lifts her chin, meeting her mother's eyes with quiet determination. "But if I never walk alone, how will I learn what waits—and how to face it?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe gently tucks a stray lock of hair behind Red's ear, her eyes searching her daughter's face for understanding. "Learning is not just about walking alone, Red—it's about knowing when to let someone guide you, especially when the woods can change without warning." ——Red's Mother

'The Wolf has been seen again.

Promise me.

' Red shifts the basket in her grip, glancing toward the sunlit sliver between the trees, and nods.

Her mother presses the basket into Red's hands, brushing stray flour from her own apron, and watches as Red steps onto the narrow footpath leading into the woods.

Birds scatter from the branches overhead as Red takes her first steps, the crunch of gravel loud beneath her boots.

# Chapter 2: Entering the Forbidden Woods

Red steps onto the narrow path leading into the woods, clutching a woven basket packed with bread, honey, jam, and tea for her grandmother.

Her mother, standing just outside their cottage, intercepts her, more insistent than before, expressing heightened concern about wolves prowling near the old path.

Red's MotherShe places a gentle but firm hand on Red's shoulder, her eyes filled with worry as she leans in, blocking the doorway and searching her daughter's face for a sign of hesitation. "Red, please, listen to me for a moment. The woods aren't safe today—I've heard talk of wolves prowling near the old path. I can't let you go alone, not with the dangers out there. Your grandmother will understand if we wait or go together." ——Red's Mother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red gently tries to step around her mother's hand, her eyes earnest and pleading. "But Mother, Grandmother needs the bread and honey, and I promised her I'd come; if I'm careful and stay on the main path, I'll be home before sunset, I swear." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe squeezes Red's shoulder gently, her eyes searching her daughter's face for any sign of hesitation. "Oh, Red, your heart is so kind, but promises mean little if danger finds you first; please, let me come with you or at least wait for your father to return—just this once." ——Red's Mother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red gently takes her mother's hands in hers, looking up with pleading eyes, her basket ready at her side. "Mother, I know the woods better than anyone, and if I wait, Grandmother might go hungry—please trust me just this once." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherHer grip tightens gently on Red's shoulder, her eyes pleading for understanding. "I wish I could trust that the woods will be as gentle with you as you are with them, but a mother's worry never rests, Red." ——Red's Mother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red gently squeezes her mother's hand, her own voice steady but her eyes pleading for trust. "I understand your worry, Mother, but I promise I'll keep my hood up, my eyes open, and my feet on the path—Grandmother is counting on me." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's mother pleads with Red to wait for her father or let her accompany Red, but Red insists she cannot delay, emphasizing her promise to her grandmother and her familiarity with the woods.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red holds up the basket proudly, her eyes bright with determination, clutching the handle tightly as she looks up at her mother. "Mother, I promise I'll be careful. See? I've packed everything you asked for—fresh bread, jam, and Granny's tea. I know the way, and I'll stay right on the path, just like you said. Granny's counting on me, and I won't let you down!" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe gently tucks a strand of hair behind Red's ear and squeezes her hand, her eyes full of concern. "Oh, my dear, I know you're growing up, but the woods can be tricky—remember, don't talk to strangers and come straight home after seeing Granny." ——Red's Mother

After several heartfelt exchanges, Red’s mother reluctantly relents, pressing a red cloak onto Red's shoulders and making her promise to keep it visible as a warning to predators and as a sign of protection.

Red's MotherHer mother gently drapes the red cloak over Red's shoulders, her hands lingering as if reluctant to let go, her eyes searching Red's face for reassurance. "Red, please—promise me you'll keep this cloak on at all times. It's not just to keep you warm; it's a signal to the wolves and anything else lurking in those woods that you are not alone, that you are protected by watchful eyes. I know you want to be brave, but my heart aches at the thought of you wandering those shadows." ——Red's Mother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red pulls the cloak closer, meeting her mother's anxious gaze with a determined but gentle smile. "I promise, Mother—I'll keep it tight around me, and I'll remember your words with every step; I know you only want to keep me safe." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red reassures her mother, promising to stay on the path, keep her cloak on, and heed her mother's warnings.

Her mother gives final reminders about not talking to strangers and hovers anxiously as Red walks beneath the trees, watching for danger and listening to the forest sounds.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Red Meets the Stranger

Red clutches a wicker basket lined with a red cloth, carefully stepping over tangled roots as she follows the narrow path toward her grandmother's cottage.

She pauses to adjust her hood and scan the thick underbrush, alert after her mother's warnings.

Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from the shadows between two gnarled trees, his fur bristling and nose twitching as he sniffs the air.

The Wolf blocks the path, lowering his head as if in greeting.

He speaks with a slow, deliberate cadence, 'Where are you off to, little one, so deep in the woods?

The Wolf steps from behind a gnarled tree, his yellow eyes glinting as he blocks the narrow path, a slow, unsettling smile curling across his muzzle. "Where are you off to, little one, so deep in the woods? Not many venture here alone. Are you not afraid of what might be lurking in the shadows?" ——The Wolf

' Red, determined to appear brave, stands tall and replies, 'I'm bringing food to my sick grandmother.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red lifts her chin and grips the basket tightly, her voice steady with determination as she looks ahead along the forest path. "I'm not afraid of these woods. I'm on a mission to bring this basket of food to my grandmother—she's sick and needs my help. Nothing will stop me from getting to her." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

' The Wolf’s eyes narrow as he circles her, tail flicking, and suggests a shortcut, pointing his snout toward a faint trail.

The Wolf’s lips curl into a cordial smile as he pauses, nose pointing toward the shadowed shortcut, his gaze fixed intently on her, tail swaying with feigned nonchalance. "You know, the path to Grandmother’s house can be dreadfully long and dull. But if you’re looking for a little adventure—and perhaps to arrive before the sun climbs too high—there’s a quieter way, just here. See that trail, barely trodden? It winds through the sweetest glade, where the wildflowers bloom brightest. Wouldn’t you like to see it?" ——The Wolf

Red hesitates but grips her basket tighter, declining his offer and insisting she knows her way.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red straightens her shoulders, her grip tightening on the basket as she looks ahead with calm determination, a hint of caution in her eyes. "Thank you for your offer, but I know this path very well. Grandmother's cottage isn't far, and I prefer to walk on my own. It's a lovely day, and I have everything I need." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf watches her with calculated patience as she steps around him and continues down the path, while he slips silently into the undergrowth, planning his next move.

Red’s objective to reach her grandmother is met with delay and suspicion, while the Wolf’s motivation to deceive and hunt is set in motion by their encounter.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: The Wolf Arrives First

The Wolf, his fur slick with dew, pads silently through the undergrowth and circles the cottage, nose twitching as he catches the scent of illness and bread.

He presses his ear to the warped wooden door and hears Grandmother's rasping cough.

With a guttural growl, he rears up and scratches at the latch, mimicking a human knock.

Inside, Grandmother rises shakily from her bed, clutching her shawl, and shuffles to the door, her voice quavering as she calls out, 'Who is it at this hour?

' The Wolf, voice low and gruff, answers, 'It's Red, I've brought you breakfast.

' Grandmother hesitates, then unlatches the door, only to have the Wolf shove it open, knocking her backwards.

He lunges, teeth flashing, as she grabs a poker from the hearth and swings at his muzzle, managing to graze his snout before he overpowers her and drags her toward the bed.

The Wolf glances at the red cloak hanging on a peg by the door, eyes narrowing as he considers his next move.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red Enters the Cottage

Red approaches the cottage, basket in hand, and knocks on the weather-beaten door.

The Wolf, cloaked in Grandmother's nightgown, ambles across the creaking floorboards and calls out in a hoarse voice, 'Come in, dear.

' Red enters, noting a strange, musky odor and the heavy silence as her eyes adjust to the dimness.

Setting the basket on the table, she hesitates, scrutinizing the figure in bed.

The Wolf, with a clawed hand hidden under blankets, beckons her closer.

The conversation turns unsettling: after Red inquires about the roughness of the voice, the Wolf elaborates ominously about the cold that seeps into bones, then tries repeatedly to coax Red closer, using soothing yet insistent words, emphasizing warmth and safety and urging her to come within reach.

Red, sensing unease but driven by concern, inches forward, the tension mounting as the Wolf grows more persuasive and intent on drawing her near.

The scene ends with Red on the threshold of the bed, the Wolf poised to spring, both locked in a tense psychological standoff.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red pauses at the doorway, clutching her basket tightly. Her eyes scan the shadowed room, searching for the familiar softness in her grandmother's face, but something feels… off. She hesitates, her voice trembling as she steps closer to the bed. "Grandmother, why is your voice so rough?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Wolf Reveals Himself

Red enters the dim cottage, basket in hand, her boots crunching over scattered pine needles near the door.

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, lies stiffly in bed, keeping his snout half-hidden under a quilt.

Red sets the basket down on the rough-hewn table and steps closer, squinting at the figure in bed.

The Wolf, using a raspy, imitated voice, beckons Red closer by patting the bed and says, 'Come nearer, child, so I may see you better.

' Red hesitates, glancing at the strange, musky scent in the air and the sharp glint of the Wolf's yellowed teeth peeking from beneath the covers.

She edges nearer, reaching out to touch the Wolf's paw, frowning at its coarse texture.

The Wolf shifts, tightening his grip on the blanket, and prepares to spring.

The objective is for Red to realize something is wrong, while the Wolf maneuvers her into striking distance.

The scene ends with Red asking, 'Grandmother, what big eyes you have,' as the Wolf's tail twitches beneath the quilt, ready to reveal himself.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Huntsman Intervenes

Red enters the dim cottage, clutching her basket, and is confronted by the Wolf disguised as her Grandmother.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates on the threshold, tightening her grip on the basket. She peers warily at the figure in bed, her voice trembling just a little as she steps closer, scanning the shadowed face peeking out from beneath the quilt. "Grandmother? Is that you? My, what big eyes you have." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, his gaze never leaving Red, a sly smile curling beneath the oversized bonnet. "The better to see you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red edges closer, her grip tightening on the basket as she studies the Wolf's strange features. "And Grandmother, what big ears you have." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf's furry ears twitch atop his head, poking out from beneath the quilt as he leans forward, voice low and inviting. "The better to hear you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a cautious step back, her grip tightening on the basket as her eyes widen in fear. "Grandmother, what big teeth you have." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf throws off the quilt, revealing his true form as he lunges toward Red, claws outstretched. "The better to eat you with, my dear!" ——The Wolf

The Wolf attempts to lure Red closer with imitations of Grandmother's voice, but Red grows suspicious due to the Wolf's strange tone.

The Wolf nestles deeper beneath the covers, keeping his sharp eyes on Red, his voice trembling with a practiced frailty. He curls his claws beneath the patchwork quilt, every muscle taut, a low, almost imperceptible rumble in his chest as he beckons Red forward with a wavering hand. "Come in, dear child. Don't be shy. It's so good to see you. Come closer, so your poor old Grandmother can see you better." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates at the doorway, clutching her basket tightly and peering into the dimly lit room, trying to make out her grandmother's face. "Grandmother, your voice sounds so strange—are you feeling alright?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf stretches a trembling paw from beneath the covers, eyes glittering hungrily as he beckons Red to approach. "Oh, it's just a touch of a cold, my dear—come nearer, so I can hold your hand." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tightly and peering uneasily at the shadowed figure beneath the covers. "But Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf blinks slowly, keeping his gaze fixed hungrily on Red, his claws hidden beneath the blanket. "The better to see you with, my child." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a hesitant step closer, her brow furrowing as she studies the unfamiliar shape beneath the covers. "And Grandmother, what big ears you have!" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf's ears twitch eagerly as he leans forward, maintaining his gentle facade while his eyes gleam with hungry anticipation. "The better to hear you with, my sweet." ——The Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, clutching her basket tightly, her eyes wide with growing alarm as she steps back. "Grandmother, what big teeth you have!" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf bares his sharp teeth in a menacing grin, springing forward from the bed toward Red. "The better to eat you with, my dear!" ——The Wolf

Red openly questions these oddities, displaying both caution and bravery.

As the Wolf reveals his predatory intent, the Huntsman bursts in, axe raised, prepared to intervene.

The Wolf, sensing the threat, warns the Huntsman to stay back and tries to negotiate, expressing his desperation and hunger.

Red, emboldened, refuses to be cowed, insisting that her grandmother deserves justice and urging restraint, not violence.

The Huntsman stands between Red and the Wolf, resolute in his protection but also willing to give the Wolf a chance to surrender.

The Wolf crouches low, lips curled in a snarl, eyes darting between the Huntsman and Red. His muscles tense, ready to spring, claws carving lines into the dirt. "Stay back, Huntsman. I have nothing left to lose. Every moment you stand in my way, my hunger grows sharper. Move aside, and maybe you both walk away with your skin intact." ——The Wolf

The Huntsman steps forward, axe raised, positioning himself firmly between Red and the snarling Wolf. "You won't lay a claw on her while I still draw breath, Wolf—find your mercy, or face my blade." ——The Huntsman

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps out from behind the Huntsman, voice trembling but eyes fierce, clutching her basket tightly as she faces the Wolf. "Please—don't hurt him, but I won't let you frighten me into silence any longer; my grandmother deserves justice." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his stance, muscles coiled, eyes flicking between the Huntsman's sword and Red's trembling hands, preparing to lunge. "Mercy is for those who have tasted it—my bones ache with emptiness, and your blade won't fill me as justice never filled her." ——The Wolf

The Huntsman tightens his grip on his axe, planting himself firmly between Red and the snarling Wolf, his eyes cold with resolve. "You speak of emptiness, Wolf, but I see only the hollowness of your choices—step away from Red, or this night will end with your hunger silenced forever." ——The Huntsman

The tense standoff continues, with the Wolf cornered and desperate, forced to consider escape as the Huntsman prepares to strike if attacked.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Aftermath and Consequences

Red kneels beside Grandmother’s bed, gently tucking a woolen blanket around her frail shoulders.

The Huntsman stands near the open door, sharpening his axe on a whetstone while scanning the edge of the woods through the window, boots caked with mud from the clearing.

Red gathers scattered herbs and places them on a cracked table, determined to help Grandmother recover.

Grandmother, voice raspy, instructs Red to fetch water from the well and asks the Huntsman about the Wolf’s fate.

Grandmother sits propped against her pillow, voice barely a whisper, hands trembling as she gestures weakly toward the door. Her eyes flicker with worry as she turns to the Huntsman, searching his face for reassurance. "Red, child. would you fetch me a pail of water from the well? My throat is dry as old kindling. And Huntsman—tell me, what became of that dreadful Wolf? Is he gone for good?" ——Grandmother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red picks up the empty pail, glancing anxiously at the Huntsman as she heads for the cottage door. "Of course, Grandmother—I'll hurry to the well now, and Huntsman, please tell her the Wolf won't trouble us ever again." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Huntsman lays his hand gently on the bedpost, offering a steady presence as Red slips out the door, bucket in hand, the tension in the room slowly unraveling. "Rest easy, ma'am—the Wolf is no more; he won't cast a shadow on this cottage again." ——The Huntsman

The Huntsman replies, 'The beast won’t threaten your door again,' then steps outside, leaving muddy footprints on the wooden floor, intent on checking the perimeter for any lingering danger.
