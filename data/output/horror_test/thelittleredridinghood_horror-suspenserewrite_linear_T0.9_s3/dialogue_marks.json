Do not stray, no matter what you hear.' Red pulls her hand free, insisting she knows the way, but her mother steps closer, lowering her voice. 'The Wolf has been seen again. Promise me.' Red shifts the basket in her grip, glancing toward the sunlit sliver between the trees, and nods. Her mother presses the basket into Red's hands, brushing stray flour from her own apron, and watches as Red steps onto the narrow footpath leading into the woods. Birds scatter from the branches overhead as Red takes her first steps, the crunch of gravel loud beneath her boots.",
