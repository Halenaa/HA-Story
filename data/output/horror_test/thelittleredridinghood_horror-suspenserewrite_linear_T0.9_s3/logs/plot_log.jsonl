Red's mother closes the basket with a firm snap, then grasps Red's wrist, her eyes scanning the shadows at the forest's edge. She warns, 'Stay on the path, Red. Do not stray, no matter what you hear.' Red pulls her hand free, insisting she knows the way, but her mother steps closer, lowering her voice. 'The Wolf has been seen again. Promise me.' Red shifts the basket in her grip, glancing toward the sunlit sliver between the trees, and nods. Her mother presses the basket into Red's hands, brushing stray flour from her own apron, and watches as Red steps onto the narrow footpath leading into the woods. Birds scatter from the branches overhead as Red takes her first steps, the crunch of gravel loud beneath her boots."}}

He speaks with a slow, deliberate cadence, 'Where are you off to, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red, determined to appear brave, stands tall and replies, 'I'm bringing food to my sick grandmother.' The Wolf’s eyes narrow as he circles her, tail flicking, and suggests a shortcut, pointing his snout toward a faint trail. Red hesitates but grips her basket tighter, declining his offer and insisting she knows her way. The Wolf watches her with calculated patience as she steps around him and continues down the path, while he slips silently into the undergrowth, planning his next move.

Inside, Grandmother rises shakily from her bed, clutching her shawl, and shuffles to the door, her voice quavering as she calls out, 'Who is it at this hour?' The Wolf, voice low and gruff, answers, 'It's Red, I've brought you breakfast.' Grandmother hesitates, then unlatches the door, only to have the Wolf shove it open, knocking her backwards. He lunges, teeth flashing, as she grabs a poker from the hearth and swings at his muzzle, managing to graze his snout before he overpowers her and drags her toward the bed. The Wolf glances at the red cloak hanging on a peg by the door, eyes narrowing as he considers his next move."}}
