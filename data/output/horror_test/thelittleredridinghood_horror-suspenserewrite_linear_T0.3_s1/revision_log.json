This culminates in the real Grandmother audibly calling for help before the Wolf attacks, which differs from the original plot where action is triggered by Red's distraction and Grandmother's discreet signal, and the Wolf immediately lunges. The updated plot now reflects a more drawn-out confrontation where the deception is broken by Grandmother's direct intervention, and the escape follows.",
