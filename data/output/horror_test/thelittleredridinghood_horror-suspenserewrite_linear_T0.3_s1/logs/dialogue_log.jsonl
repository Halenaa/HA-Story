Red listens to her mother’s anxious, repeated pleas and—while still determined to help her grandmother—feels the weight of her mother’s concern more keenly.

The Wolf's yellow eyes fix on Red, his nose twitching as he sniffs the aroma of bread from the basket. Red tightens her grip on the basket and stands her ground, recalling her mother's warnings. The Wolf cocks his head and speaks in a silky voice, 'Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red keeps her distance, replying, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her food.' The Wolf circles closer, paws silent on the moss, angling to intercept her route. Red, wary, shifts sideways, keeping herself between the Wolf and the basket. The Wolf’s tail flicks as he considers his next move, eyes narrowing with hunger and calculation. Red's determination to reach her grandmother safely drives her to step off the main path, searching for a safer route through the underbrush.

Grandmother, sensing something amiss from the rough cadence, hesitates, her fingers hovering over the latch. The Wolf, impatient, presses his snout closer to the crack in the door and sniffs, eyes darting for any sign of movement inside.

Instead of only asking about physical features, Red also probes with layered questions, implying suspicion—she asks about the ears, eyes, and teeth but attaches meaning to each: listening for someone, watching for someone, and questioning the intent behind the teeth. The Wolf, slightly unsettled by Red's perceptiveness, tries to maintain his disguise but shifts the conversation, asking why Red is alone in the woods and attempting to unsettle her with references to danger.
