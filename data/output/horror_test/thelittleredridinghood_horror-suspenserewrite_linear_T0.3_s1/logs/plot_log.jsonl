She tightens the red cape around Red's shoulders, her fingers brushing crumbs from the fabric. Red tucks a folded note between the jars, determined to deliver it to Grandmother herself. Red's Mother crouches to eye level, placing a firm hand on Red's shoulder and pointing toward the shadowed trail snaking into the woods. She warns, 'Do not stray from the path. The forest holds dangers you cannot outwit.' Red, holding the basket handle tightly, nods and glances at the forest edge, determined to prove her maturity. As Red's Mother closes the garden gate behind her daughter, she watches Red step onto the leaf-strewn path, the basket swinging by her side as she disappears into the mist."}}

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, scanning the undergrowth for any sign of movement. Suddenly, a large gray Wolf pads onto the path ahead, blocking her way with a low growl. The Wolf's yellow eyes fix on Red, his nose twitching as he sniffs the aroma of bread from the basket. Red tightens her grip on the basket and stands her ground, recalling her mother's warnings. The Wolf cocks his head and speaks in a silky voice, 'Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red keeps her distance, replying, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her food.' The Wolf circles closer, paws silent on the moss, angling to intercept her route. Red, wary, shifts sideways, keeping herself between the Wolf and the basket. The Wolf’s tail flicks as he considers his next move, eyes narrowing with hunger and calculation. Red's determination to reach her grandmother safely drives her to step off the main path, searching for a safer route through the underbrush. The Wolf watches, memorizing her direction, then melts into the shadows, planning to get ahead. The encounter leaves Red alert and pushes her to quicken her pace through the increasingly tangled woods."}}

Driven by hunger, he pads silently to the cottage door and raps his heavy paw against the wood. Grandmother, weakened but alert, wraps her shawl tighter and squints through the foggy window before shuffling to the door, cane tapping against uneven floorboards. The Wolf, disguising his voice in a thin, wavering tone, calls out, 'Grandmother, it's Red with your supper.' Grandmother, sensing something amiss from the rough cadence, hesitates, her fingers hovering over the latch. The Wolf, impatient, presses his snout closer to the crack in the door and sniffs, eyes darting for any sign of movement inside. Grandmother, unwilling to risk a direct confrontation, slowly backs away from the door and begins searching her kitchen for something to defend herself with. The Wolf, realizing his ruse may not last, shoves the door with his shoulder, splintering the wood, and forces his way into the dim, smoky cottage."}}

She notices the blanket tugged unusually high over Grandmother’s form and the odd way 'Grandmother' clears her throat—a guttural rasp not matching her memory. Driven by caution and curiosity, Red sets the basket on the table and moves closer, pretending to adjust the curtain while stealing glances at the figure in bed. The Wolf, disguised and alert, shifts under the covers, his paw hidden but ready, voice low and gravelly as he urges Red to come nearer. Red, determined to protect her grandmother and uncover the truth, asks deliberate questions ('Grandmother, what big ears you have'), inching closer while gripping the basket tightly. The Wolf, motivated by hunger and the thrill of deception, answers with sly, rehearsed replies, watching for a moment when Red lets her guard down. The scene ends with Red noticing coarse fur peeking from the blanket, her suspicion intensifying as she prepares to act."}}

Red plants her feet, raises a sturdy branch she found earlier, and calls out, 'Stay back! I won’t let you hurt her.' The Wolf snarls, circling Red with measured steps, his tail lashing. He lunges, snapping at the basket, but Red swings the branch, striking his muzzle and driving him back. Leaves scatter and a sharp yelp echoes through the clearing. The Wolf retreats, licking his wound, while Red darts past him toward the cottage, determined to reach her grandmother."}}

Grandmother, concealed in the small closet, rattles a broom handle against the door to signal her presence. The Wolf lunges from the bed, jaws snapping at Red, but Red grabs a pot from the hearth and hurls it at the Wolf's head, forcing him to stagger back. As the Wolf shakes off the blow, Red dashes to the closet, unlocks it, and helps Grandmother out. Together, they scramble out the back door, tripping over tangled roots and running toward the thicket as the Wolf bounds after them, claws scraping the wood. The objective is to escape the Wolf; the outcome is Red and Grandmother fleeing into the forest, with the Wolf in pursuit."}}
