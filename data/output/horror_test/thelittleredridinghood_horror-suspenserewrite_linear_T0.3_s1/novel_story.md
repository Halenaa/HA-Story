# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning and a Basket

Red's Mother stands in the garden, placing a heavy woven basket filled with warm bread, jars of broth, and herbs onto the stone bench.

She tightens the red cape around Red's shoulders, her fingers brushing crumbs from the fabric.

Red tucks a folded note between the jars, determined to deliver it to Grandmother herself.

Before Red departs, her mother becomes especially insistent, repeating her warnings several times with growing urgency.

She warns Red not only of the dangers in the woods but emphasizes that wit and bravery may not be enough to keep her safe, making Red promise explicitly to keep to the path.

Red's MotherShe kneels down to adjust Red's cloak, her eyes filled with concern as she holds Red's hands firmly, emphasizing the gravity of her words. "Remember, my dear, do not stray from the path, no matter what you see or hear. The woods can be treacherous, and there are dangers lurking where you least expect them." ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, looking deep into her eyes with concern. "Promise me you'll listen, for it's not just your basket that needs protecting—it's your very self." ——Red's Mother

Red listens to her mother’s anxious, repeated pleas and—while still determined to help her grandmother—feels the weight of her mother’s concern more keenly.

Red's MotherShe places her hands firmly on Red’s shoulders, her eyes serious and full of worry. "Red, promise me you’ll remember this: the forest holds dangers you cannot outwit. No matter how clever or brave you think you are, there are things among those trees that do not play by our rules. Experience alone will not keep you safe—sometimes, caution is the only thing that stands between you and harm." ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe gently grasps Red's shoulders, her eyes searching Red's face for understanding. "So listen well, my child, and keep to the path, for even a single misstep can lead you where neither wit nor courage can bring you back." ——Red's Mother

As Red’s Mother closes the garden gate behind her daughter, she watches Red step onto the leaf-strewn path, the basket swinging by her side as she disappears into the mist.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: The Wolf Blocks the Path

Red steps carefully along the uneven path, her boots crunching on fallen leaves as she balances a wicker basket laden with bread and wildflowers.

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, scanning the undergrowth for any sign of movement.

Suddenly, a large gray Wolf pads onto the path ahead, blocking her way with a low growl.

The Wolf's yellow eyes fix on Red, his nose twitching as he sniffs the aroma of bread from the basket.

Red tightens her grip on the basket and stands her ground, recalling her mother's warnings.

The Wolf cocks his head and speaks in a silky voice, 'Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods?

The Wolf steps from behind a tree, eyes glinting with curiosity, his tone warm yet edged with something sharper as he blocks the narrow path with his sleek, imposing form. "Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods? These shadows are no place for someone so small and sweet. Tell me—are you lost, or is it something you seek?" ——The Wolf

' Red keeps her distance, replying, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her food.

Red steps back slightly, clutching her basket a little tighter and keeping a careful eye on her surroundings. "I'm just on my way to my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her some food. She hasn’t been feeling well lately." ——Red

' The Wolf circles closer, paws silent on the moss, angling to intercept her route.

Red, wary, shifts sideways, keeping herself between the Wolf and the basket.

The Wolf’s tail flicks as he considers his next move, eyes narrowing with hunger and calculation.

Red's determination to reach her grandmother safely drives her to step off the main path, searching for a safer route through the underbrush.

The Wolf watches, memorizing her direction, then melts into the shadows, planning to get ahead.

The encounter leaves Red alert and pushes her to quicken her pace through the increasingly tangled woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House

The Wolf, his coarse fur slicked with rain, slinks through the dripping undergrowth and pauses behind a gnarled yew tree, nostrils flaring to catch the scent of baking bread.

Driven by hunger, he pads silently to the cottage door and raps his heavy paw against the wood.

Grandmother, weakened but alert, wraps her shawl tighter and squints through the foggy window before shuffling to the door, cane tapping against uneven floorboards.

The Wolf, disguising his voice in a thin, wavering tone, calls out, 'Grandmother, it's Red with your supper.

' Grandmother, sensing something amiss from the rough cadence, hesitates, her fingers hovering over the latch.

The Wolf, impatient, presses his snout closer to the crack in the door and sniffs, eyes darting for any sign of movement inside.

Grandmother, unwilling to risk a direct confrontation, slowly backs away from the door and begins searching her kitchen for something to defend herself with.

The Wolf, realizing his ruse may not last, shoves the door with his shoulder, splintering the wood, and forces his way into the dim, smoky cottage.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Red Confronts Suspicion in the Cottage

Red enters the dim cottage, her basket in hand and boots echoing on the floorboards.

She immediately notices the strange way 'Grandmother' is covered and the odd, guttural tone of her voice.

Red, cautious and clever, places the basket on the table and approaches the bed, feigning concern while subtly investigating the figure.

Instead of only asking about physical features, Red also probes with layered questions, implying suspicion—she asks about the ears, eyes, and teeth but attaches meaning to each: listening for someone, watching for someone, and questioning the intent behind the teeth.

The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, his sharp gaze fixed on Red, voice trembling with a hunger he strains to mask. One paw tenses under the covers, claws barely contained as he beckons her forward with a crooked finger. "Come closer, dear child. The light in here is so dim, and my eyes are not what they once were. I can hardly see your sweet face from where you stand. Step nearer, let me get a better look at you." ——The Wolf

The Wolf, slightly unsettled by Red's perceptiveness, tries to maintain his disguise but shifts the conversation, asking why Red is alone in the woods and attempting to unsettle her with references to danger.

Red steps forward slowly, tightening her grip on the basket, her eyes searching the shadows of the room as she studies the figure in the bed. "Grandmother, what big ears you have. Are you listening for something? Or someone?" ——Red

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her knuckles white around the basket handle, eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. "And Grandmother, what big eyes you have. are you watching for someone, too?" ——Red

Red takes a careful step closer, her grip on the basket tightening as she studies the shadowed face before her, heart pounding in her chest. "Grandmother, what big teeth you have. are they for smiling at me, or something else?" ——Red

Red remains alert, her suspicion mounting as she notices fur beneath the blanket and prepares to act, determined to uncover the truth and defend her grandmother.

The Wolf grins, his teeth just barely concealed, eyes glinting with keen interest as he circles Red, voice smooth and gentle, masking a ravenous intent. "Well, well, Little Red, what brings you so deep into these tangled woods? Surely you must be on a very important errand, wandering all alone. Are you not afraid of what lurks beneath the branches?" ——The Wolf

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: The Wolf Attacks and Red Fights Back

Red steps cautiously along the worn dirt path, gripping the wicker basket as she scans the shadows for movement.

The Wolf, fur bristling and eyes gleaming with hunger, emerges silently behind a thicket, blocking the way with his massive frame.

He lowers his head, sniffing the basket and the air between them.

Red plants her feet, raises a sturdy branch she found earlier, and calls out, 'Stay back!

Red grips the branch tightly, her knuckles white. Her voice trembles with fear, but her stance remains firm, body tense and ready to swing if the threat advances. "I mean it—don't come any closer! I don't know who or what you are, but I swear I'll fight if I have to!" ——Red

I won’t let you hurt her.

Red steps forward, planting themselves firmly between the threat and the person they're protecting, eyes blazing with unwavering resolve. "If you want to get to her, you'll have to go through me first—and I promise, I won't let that happen." ——Red

Red steps forward, eyes narrowed, placing themselves squarely between the threat and the girl, unflinching. "You should know by now—I don't back down, not when it matters." ——Red

' The Wolf snarls, circling Red with measured steps, his tail lashing.

He lunges, snapping at the basket, but Red swings the branch, striking his muzzle and driving him back.

Leaves scatter and a sharp yelp echoes through the clearing.

The Wolf retreats, licking his wound, while Red darts past him toward the cottage, determined to reach her grandmother.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Final Confrontation and Escape

Red enters the dim cottage, calling out for her grandmother amidst unsettling silence.

Red steps cautiously inside, her eyes adjusting to the gloom. She hesitates on the threshold, her voice trembling slightly as she calls out, her grip tightening on the basket. "Grandmother? Are you here? It's me, Red." ——Red

Red steps hesitantly inside, her footsteps echoing as she peers into the shadowy corners, searching for any sign of movement. "It's so quiet—are you feeling alright?" ——Red

Red steps further inside, her eyes darting nervously to the shadows as she hugs the basket closer to her chest. "I brought your favorite soup—please say something, I'm getting worried." ——Red

Red steps further inside, her eyes darting to the shadowy corners as she hesitates by the foot of the bed. "Grandmother, please answer—it's so dark in here, and I can't see you." ——Red

Red hesitates on the threshold, her voice trembling as she peers deeper into the shadows, clutching her basket even tighter. "Maybe you're resting, but it's never this quiet when I visit." ——Red

Red steps further into the cottage, her grip on the basket tightening as she peers anxiously into the shadows. "Grandmother, if you can hear me, just give me a sign—anything—because this silence is scaring me." ——Red

She grows increasingly suspicious as she observes her 'grandmother' exhibiting strange features and mannerisms, questioning each oddity—eyes, ears, teeth, shoulders, voice, hands, breath, skin, nails, and scent—while the Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, concocts plausible excuses for each.

The Wolf pats the coverlet beside him, voice raspy but gentle, watching Red with a hungry gleam barely concealed by the shadow of Grandmother’s cap. "Come closer, dear child. The light is so dim, and my old eyes can barely see you." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tightly, peering uncertainly at the figure beneath the quilt. "Grandmother, what big eyes you have—much bigger than I remember." ——Red

The Wolf tilts its head, the eyes glinting hungrily in the flickering light. "All the better to see you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tightly, her gaze fixed on the wolf's furry ears poking out from beneath the shawl. "And Grandmother, your ears seem so long and pointed today; are you feeling well?" ——Red

The Wolf shifts slightly under the quilt, keeping his snout low and paw hidden, watching Red with a hungry glint in his eye. "All the better to hear your sweet voice, my child." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her hand tightening around the basket as her eyes search the shadowed face beneath the shawl. "But Grandmother, what large, sharp teeth you have—I've never noticed them before." ——Red

The Wolf throws off the quilt, revealing his true form, and lunges toward Red with a wicked grin. "All the better to eat you with, my dear!" ——The Wolf

Red remains cautious, probing further rather than immediately resorting to distraction or physical action.

Red sets the basket down with a soft thud, knocking over a tin cup so it clatters to the floor, her gaze never leaving the odd, lumpy form in the bed. She takes a cautious step closer, her fingers grazing the rough wood of the bedpost, eyes narrowing as she tries to make out the features beneath the covers. "My, Grandmother, what big shoulders you have today. Are you feeling quite yourself?" ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, drawing it tighter around himself as his eyes narrow, watching Red's every move. "Oh, child, the better to carry my many worries—these old bones ache more than they used to." ——The Wolf

Red edges closer, her gaze narrowing as she studies the Wolf's face in the dim light. "And your voice—it's so rough tonight, almost as if you caught a chill in the woods." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the blankets, pulling them higher to obscure his face, eyes glinting from the shadowy folds. "Ah, it's merely the draft, dear—the wind rattles these shutters and makes my throat rasp; you know how this cottage sits at the edge of the wild." ——The Wolf

Red inches closer, her gaze fixed on the gnarled hands peeking from beneath the quilt, her own hands clenched behind her back. "Red: And your hands, Grandmother—how large they look, gripping the blanket so tightly." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, tucking his hands further out of sight, eyes narrowing as he watches Red's every move. "They're just a little swollen, child—age does that to a body, and the cold makes me clutch for warmth." ——The Wolf

Red leans in, her gaze fixed on the shadows beneath the Wolf's brow, her fingers tightening around the handle of the basket. "But your eyes—Grandmother, they've never gleamed quite so brightly, even in candlelight." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, pulling the quilt higher as his eyes narrow, watching Red's every movement. "It's only that I've missed you, dear, and seeing you so close fills me with joy." ——The Wolf

Red edges closer, her hand tightening around the handle of the basket as she leans in, her gaze fixed on the Wolf's mouth. "And yet, Grandmother, your teeth—how sharp they seem, even when you smile at me." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, pulling the blanket higher to shadow his face, his gaze never leaving Red as his lips curl into a strained imitation of a grandmother's smile. "Oh, my dear, they're just old teeth, worn to points by years of hard bread and tougher times—nothing to fear from them." ——The Wolf

Red leans in, her hand hovering just above the blanket, her gaze unwavering, searching the Wolf's face for a flicker of truth. "Still, Grandmother, your breath—it smells not of peppermint and herbs, but of the wild wood itself." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, pulling the quilt higher to shadow his face, his eyes never leaving Red as she inches closer. "Ah, child, I brewed a new tisane from fresh forest leaves this morning—perhaps the aroma lingers more than I realized." ——The Wolf

Red reaches for the oil lamp, her gaze fixed on the shadowed face beneath the covers, watching for any sign of unease. "Grandmother, would you mind if I brought the lamp closer, so I might see you better?" ——Red

The Wolf pats the quilted edge of the bed with a clawed hand barely hidden beneath the covers, his gaze fixed on Red, a nervous flicker behind his practiced smile. "No need, child—the light is harsh on my old eyes; come, sit here beside me instead, where it's warm." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates just out of arm's reach, her fingers tightening around the basket handle as she leans in, eyes narrowed in the dim glow. "But Grandmother, your skin—it looks so bristly in the shadow, as if you brought a piece of the woods in with you." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, pulling them higher over his chin, his eyes never leaving Red as the lamplight flickers between them. "The better to keep me warm, child—these old woolen blankets shed terribly, and I must have picked up some fuzz while resting." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, her gaze fixed on the Wolf's hands as she edges just a little closer, her voice trembling between curiosity and fear. "Grandmother, your nails—they're so dark and curved, not like the gentle hands that used to braid my hair." ——Red

The Wolf tucks his hands deeper beneath the covers, his gaze flickering to the lamp, wary. "Ah, child, perhaps it's just the soot from the hearth; I was tending the fire before you arrived, and it clings to everything these days." ——The Wolf

Red edges closer to the bed, her voice low, eyes searching the shadows for any sign of the familiar old woman. "Grandmother, your scent—it's not the lavender you always wore, but something wild and musky." ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, drawing them tighter around his body as his eyes narrow, watching Red's every hesitant step. "Oh, sweet child, the wind must have muddled my perfumes—come closer and you'll see it's still me beneath it all." ——The Wolf

Red steps forward, her hand outstretched but her eyes narrowed, watching every flicker of movement beneath the covers. "Then, Grandmother, if it is truly you, let me hold your hand as I used to—so I might be sure." ——Red

As the tense exchange builds, the real Grandmother suddenly knocks and calls out from the closet, revealing her presence and the Wolf's deception before the Wolf can attack.

Grandmother rattles the broom handle louder against the closet door, her voice trembling with worry. "Is someone out there? Please, it's me—Grandmother! I had to hide in here when I heard those voices downstairs. I’m knocking so you know I’m safe, but I can’t stay in here much longer. Can someone help me?" ——Grandmother

With Grandmother's voice breaking the pretense, Red and Grandmother quickly attempt to escape together, the Wolf dropping his disguise to pursue them as they flee into the forest.

# Chapter 7: Red Faces Her Mother with the Truth

Red wipes mud from her boots on the braided rug, sets the basket on the table, and faces her mother, who stands chopping roots by the window.

Red draws the Wolf’s bloodied tooth from her cloak pocket and lays it beside the basket.

Her mother, alarmed, demands an explanation.

Red's MotherHer hand trembles slightly, holding the knife above the cutting board, gaze fixed on the strange, jagged tooth. "Red, what is this? Why on earth was a tooth—this tooth—hidden in your basket? Look at it! Tell me the truth, right now. Where did you get it?" ——Red's Mother

Red vividly describes sneaking through the forest, her fear, and the tense confrontation with the Wolf in Grandmother’s bed.

Red sneaks through the underbrush, enters the cottage cautiously, and upon seeing the Wolf in Grandmother's bed, grabs the fire iron and confronts the Wolf. "The woods felt darker than ever as I crept closer to Grandmother's cottage, every rustle in the underbrush sending chills down my spine. My heart hammered in my chest as I pushed open the door, calling softly—but only silence answered. That's when I saw the Wolf, lying in Grandmother's bed, its eyes gleaming with hunger. For a moment, I was frozen with fear. But then, I spotted the fire iron by the hearth. Gritting my teeth, I grabbed it, holding it out between us. 'Get away from her!' I shouted, my voice trembling but determined." ——Red

Red steps forward, brandishing the fire iron defensively as she faces the Wolf, her stance steady despite the tremor in her hands. "The Wolf snarled, baring its teeth, but I tightened my grip on the fire iron and edged closer, refusing to let my fear show." ——Red

Red raises the fire iron higher, her knuckles white, and slowly steps between the Wolf and the bed, determined to protect her Grandmother. "I could feel my legs shaking, but I forced myself to stand firm, meeting the Wolf's gaze with every ounce of courage I had." ——Red

Red lunges forward, brandishing the fire iron with a desperate strength, her eyes locked on the Wolf as she fights to protect her Grandmother. "I swung the fire iron at the Wolf, my arms steady despite the terror clawing at my chest." ——Red

She recounts grabbing the fire iron, standing her ground despite her terror, and using it to drive the Wolf away.

Red's MotherHer mother slams the knife onto the chopping block, the sharp sound echoing her frustration, eyes blazing with worry and anger as she faces Red across the kitchen. "Red, you should have bolted straight for help the moment you saw danger! What if something had happened to you, too? You can't just throw yourself in harm's way!" ——Red's Mother

Red clenches her fists, her voice trembling with both fear and determination. "But if I hadn't stepped in, Grandmother might've died right in front of me—I couldn't just stand there and watch!" ——Red

Red's MotherShe wipes her hands on her apron, voice trembling with fear and frustration as she meets Red's eyes. "And what if I'd lost you both, Red?—sometimes protecting the ones we love means knowing when to call for help, not just rushing in alone!" ——Red's Mother

Red's voice trembles as she clenches her fists, her eyes darting between her mother's stern face and the bloodied chopping block. "I know you were scared for me, but in that moment, all I could think about was not letting Grandmother slip away." ——Red

Red's MotherHer mother wipes her hands on her apron, voice trembling with worry and relief as she glances between Red and the empty chair where Grandmother usually sits. "My heart was pounding so hard I could barely think straight—Red, I just wish you'd remembered that sometimes courage means trusting others to help, too." ——Red's Mother

Red’s mother, deeply anxious, insists Red should have run for help, fearing for her daughter’s safety.

Red counters that immediate action was the only way to save Grandmother.

The conversation grows emotional as both share their fears and reasons.

Red's MotherShe places a comforting hand on Red’s shoulder as they begin stacking the plates, her eyes scanning the darkening forest through the window, watchful yet determined. "Red, I want you to know I’m proud of how brave you were today. From now on, I’ll teach you everything I know about keeping yourself safe. The Wolf may come back, but next time, we’ll be ready—together." ——Red's Mother

Red gathers the dishes, glancing at the dark window, then meets her mother's steady gaze with a determined nod. "Thank you, Mama—I want to learn, so next time, I won't be afraid." ——Red

Red’s mother, her hands trembling, acknowledges Red’s bravery and determination, but stresses the importance of asking for help.

Overcome with emotion, she embraces Red and promises to teach her how to defend herself properly.

They agree to prepare together for the Wolf’s possible return, clearing the table side by side, united by newfound understanding.
