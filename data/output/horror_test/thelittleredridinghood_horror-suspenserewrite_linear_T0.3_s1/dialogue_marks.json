Red's Mother crouches to eye level, placing a firm hand on Red's shoulder and pointing toward the shadowed trail snaking into the woods. She warns, 'Do not stray from the path. The forest holds dangers you cannot outwit.' Red, holding the basket handle tightly, nods and glances at the forest edge, determined to prove her maturity. As Red's Mother closes the garden gate behind her daughter, she watches Red step onto the leaf-strewn path, the basket swinging by her side as she disappears into the mist.",

The Wolf cocks his head and speaks in a silky voice, 'Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red keeps her distance, replying, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her food.' The Wolf circles closer, paws silent on the moss, angling to intercept her route. Red, wary, shifts sideways, keeping herself between the Wolf and the basket. The Wolf’s tail flicks as he considers his next move, eyes narrowing with hunger and calculation. Red's determination to reach her grandmother safely drives her to step off the main path, searching for a safer route through the underbrush.
