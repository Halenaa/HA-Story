She tightens the red cape around Red's shoulders, her fingers brushing crumbs from the fabric. Red tucks a folded note between the jars, determined to deliver it to Grandmother herself. Before Red departs, her mother becomes especially insistent, repeating her warnings several times with growing urgency. She warns Red not only of the dangers in the woods but emphasizes that wit and bravery may not be enough to keep her safe, making Red promise explicitly to keep to the path. Red listens to her mother’s anxious, repeated pleas and—while still determined to help her grandmother—feels the weight of her mother’s concern more keenly. As Red’s Mother closes the garden gate behind her daughter, she watches Red step onto the leaf-strewn path, the basket swinging by her side as she disappears into the mist.",

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, scanning the undergrowth for any sign of movement. Suddenly, a large gray Wolf pads onto the path ahead, blocking her way with a low growl. The Wolf's yellow eyes fix on Red, his nose twitching as he sniffs the aroma of bread from the basket. Red tightens her grip on the basket and stands her ground, recalling her mother's warnings. The Wolf cocks his head and speaks in a silky voice, 'Where are you going, little one, so deep in the woods?' Red keeps her distance, replying, 'To my grandmother’s cottage, to bring her food.' The Wolf circles closer, paws silent on the moss, angling to intercept her route. Red, wary, shifts sideways, keeping herself between the Wolf and the basket. The Wolf’s tail flicks as he considers his next move, eyes narrowing with hunger and calculation. Red's determination to reach her grandmother safely drives her to step off the main path, searching for a safer route through the underbrush. The Wolf watches, memorizing her direction, then melts into the shadows, planning to get ahead. The encounter leaves Red alert and pushes her to quicken her pace through the increasingly tangled woods.",

Driven by hunger, he pads silently to the cottage door and raps his heavy paw against the wood. Grandmother, weakened but alert, wraps her shawl tighter and squints through the foggy window before shuffling to the door, cane tapping against uneven floorboards. The Wolf, disguising his voice in a thin, wavering tone, calls out, 'Grandmother, it's Red with your supper.' Grandmother, sensing something amiss from the rough cadence, hesitates, her fingers hovering over the latch. The Wolf, impatient, presses his snout closer to the crack in the door and sniffs, eyes darting for any sign of movement inside. Grandmother, unwilling to risk a direct confrontation, slowly backs away from the door and begins searching her kitchen for something to defend herself with. The Wolf, realizing his ruse may not last, shoves the door with his shoulder, splintering the wood, and forces his way into the dim, smoky cottage.",

She immediately notices the strange way 'Grandmother' is covered and the odd, guttural tone of her voice. Red, cautious and clever, places the basket on the table and approaches the bed, feigning concern while subtly investigating the figure. Instead of only asking about physical features, Red also probes with layered questions, implying suspicion—she asks about the ears, eyes, and teeth but attaches meaning to each: listening for someone, watching for someone, and questioning the intent behind the teeth. The Wolf, slightly unsettled by Red's perceptiveness, tries to maintain his disguise but shifts the conversation, asking why Red is alone in the woods and attempting to unsettle her with references to danger. Red remains alert, her suspicion mounting as she notices fur beneath the blanket and prepares to act, determined to uncover the truth and defend her grandmother.",

Red plants her feet, raises a sturdy branch she found earlier, and calls out, 'Stay back! I won’t let you hurt her.' The Wolf snarls, circling Red with measured steps, his tail lashing. He lunges, snapping at the basket, but Red swings the branch, striking his muzzle and driving him back. Leaves scatter and a sharp yelp echoes through the clearing.

Red remains cautious, probing further rather than immediately resorting to distraction or physical action. As the tense exchange builds, the real Grandmother suddenly knocks and calls out from the closet, revealing her presence and the Wolf's deception before the Wolf can attack.

Red’s mother, deeply anxious, insists Red should have run for help, fearing for her daughter’s safety. Red counters that immediate action was the only way to save Grandmother.
