This requires a slight update to the plot, emphasizing the Wolf's verbal deception and Grandmother's internal conflict about opening the door.",

The updated plot now reflects her open internal conflict and greater likelihood of straying, maintaining character logic and foreshadowing future events.",

The Huntsman expresses willingness to be hated if it means saving Red, and the Wolf manipulates Red's curiosity and empathy.

Additionally, Mother decides they will return together to the spot where Red saw the figure, which is also new.
