She paused, lost in thought, her mind swirling with uncertainty about her journey and the legends she’d heard. The old key, rumored to hold secrets in the forest, lingered in her thoughts, making her question whether her path was truly straightforward. As she examined a cluster of wild violets, she wondered if the stories about the key were more than fairy tales—perhaps clues she’d overlooked. Suddenly, the underbrush rustled nearby; a large grey wolf stepped into view, its fur bristling with dew, amber eyes fixed on Red. The Wolf halted a few paces away, lowering its head in a mimicry of curiosity, and spoke in a low, smooth voice, 'Good day, little one. Where are you bound to so early?' Red gripped the basket tighter, hesitating, but remembered her mother’s advice to be polite to strangers. 'I’m visiting my grandmother, sir, she lives in the cottage just past the birch grove.' Distracted by her questions about the key, Red’s uncertainty was palpable in her voice. The Wolf inched closer, ears pricked and tail flicking, sniffing the air to catch the scent of the food. It nodded, feigning interest, and asked, 'Is your grandmother expecting you?' Red nodded, shifting her feet on the soft, leaf-littered path. The Wolf circled slowly, calculating, its gaze never leaving Red’s face. Red kept her eyes on the path ahead, determined to move on, but the Wolf blocked her way, insisting, 'The forest is full of surprises. Perhaps you’d like to pick some flowers for your dear grandmother?' Red’s curiosity sparked; she glanced at the wildflowers, torn between caution and the chance to brighten her grandmother’s day, and the lingering mystery of the key and its legends. The Wolf stepped aside, gesturing with its muzzle toward a sunlit patch of blooms, already planning its next move as Red crouched to gather a handful.
