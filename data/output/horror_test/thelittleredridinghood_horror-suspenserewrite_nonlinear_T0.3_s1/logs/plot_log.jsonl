From inside, a weak reply echoed, oddly muffled: 'Come in, child.' Red gripped the basket tighter, stepping inside and glancing around. Her eyes settled on the figure in bed, swaddled in blankets. Grandmother's face was shadowed, her eyes glinting strangely as she beckoned Red closer. Red set the basket down, watching Grandmother's hands tremble as she reached for the bowl. Red moved forward, her motivation to care for her grandmother driving her actions, but she hesitated, sensing something amiss in Grandmother's voice and movements. Grandmother, eager to alleviate her weakness, urged Red to sit nearby and pass the food, her frail fingers clutching the spoon. As Red poured the broth, she scanned her grandmother's features, noting a peculiar sharpness to the gaze and an odd stiffness in the way she accepted the meal. The cottage, usually a haven, felt strangely silent and thick with unease, but Red pressed on, determined to fulfill her task."}}

With a calculated leap, he pushes open a loose shutter, squeezing through with a low grunt. Inside, the Wolf pads across the creaking floorboards, eyes fixed on Grandmother, who turns at the sudden draft. 'Who’s there?' she calls, her voice wavering. The Wolf, mimicking a pitiful whimper, answers: 'Only a lost soul seeking shelter.' Grandmother hesitates, her hand trembling as she approaches, and the Wolf waits, muscles tensed, prepared to strike the moment her guard drops.

Red gripped the basket tighter, hesitating, but remembered her mother’s advice to be polite to strangers. 'I’m visiting my grandmother, sir, she lives in the cottage just past the birch grove.' The Wolf inched closer, ears pricked and tail flicking, sniffing the air to catch the scent of the food. It nodded, feigning interest, and asked, 'Is your grandmother expecting you?' Red nodded, shifting her feet on the soft, leaf-littered path. The Wolf circled slowly, calculating, its gaze never leaving Red’s face. Red kept her eyes on the path ahead, determined to move on, but the Wolf blocked her way, insisting, 'The forest is full of surprises. Perhaps you’d like to pick some flowers for your dear grandmother?' Red’s curiosity sparked; she glanced at the wildflowers, torn between caution and the chance to brighten her grandmother’s day. The Wolf stepped aside, gesturing with its muzzle toward a sunlit patch of blooms, already planning its next move as Red crouched to gather a handful. The Wolf’s patient watchfulness, Red’s hesitance, and the hush of the forest set the tense rhythm of their encounter."}}
