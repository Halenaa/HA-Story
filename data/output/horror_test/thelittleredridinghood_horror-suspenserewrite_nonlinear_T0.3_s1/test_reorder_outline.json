        "summary": "Red enters the cottage, noticing strange details: the door ajar, muddy paw prints, and her grandmother’s voice sounding odd. She questions ‘Grandmother’ about her appearance, sparking a tense exchange. Red’s suspicion grows, and she decides to look around the cottage for her real grandmother.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Suspicion, Opening Scene",
        "narrative_instruction": "Narrate in third person limited, past tense, closely following Red’s perceptions and inner fears. Establish Red as unfamiliar with the danger but acutely aware of unease. Characters (Red, 'Grandmother'/Wolf) must be introduced as if the reader is meeting them for the first time. Withhold any prior knowledge of the wolf’s identity; Red only suspects strangeness, not the truth.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin with an atmospheric, suspenseful entry: describe Red arriving at the cottage, the unsettling quiet, and the small, ominous details she notices. As this is the first chapter, no transition from prior text is required."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, shifting the lens to follow the Wolf’s actions and point of view, but do not reveal information Red could not plausibly know in detail. Narration must keep the reader in suspense, revealing only what Red might later learn or suspect. Present the wolf’s intrusion as a flashback, prompted by Red’s suspicions in the previous chapter.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition via Red’s growing unease: as she notices something amiss, interpolate a flashback triggered by a detail (e.g., muddy paw prints) to reveal how the situation at the cottage unfolded before her arrival."
