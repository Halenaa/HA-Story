# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Senses Danger

Red paused at the threshold, knocking firmly but hesitantly on the swollen door.

The cottage smelled of lavender and earth, but there was a faint, unfamiliar musk in the air.

Red called out, her voice wavering, 'Grandmother, it's me—I've brought your broth.

Red hesitates at the doorway, clutching the steaming bowl tightly. Her eyes dart around the dimly lit cottage, searching for any sign of movement, her heart thudding louder with each moment of silence. "Grandmother? It's me—Red. I. I brought your broth, just like you asked." ——Red

' From inside, a weak reply echoed, oddly muffled: 'Come in, child.

Grandmother shifts in bed, her voice trembling as she tries to sit up, a thin hand reaching toward the dimly lit doorway. "Is that you, dear? My eyes aren't what they used to be. Please, come closer so I can see you better." ——Grandmother

' Red gripped the basket tighter, stepping inside and glancing around.

Her eyes settled on the figure in bed, swaddled in blankets.

Grandmother's face was shadowed, her eyes glinting strangely as she beckoned Red closer.

Red set the basket down, watching Grandmother's hands tremble as she reached for the bowl.

Red moved forward, her motivation to care for her grandmother driving her actions, but she hesitated, sensing something amiss in Grandmother's voice and movements.

Grandmother, eager to alleviate her weakness, urged Red to sit nearby and pass the food, her frail fingers clutching the spoon.

Grandmother's voice trembles as she beckons Red to her side, her frail fingers trembling around the handle of the spoon, eyes searching Red's face for comfort and reassurance. "Red, dear, could you come a bit closer? My hands aren't as steady as they used to be, and I find it hard to hold the spoon. Would you help me with the soup?" ——Grandmother

Red moves her chair closer to Grandmother, gently taking the spoon from her trembling hand and offering a reassuring smile. "Of course, Grandmother—I’ll sit right here and help; you just tell me if you need anything else." ——Red

Grandmother shakily reaches out, her eyes glistening with gratitude as Red gently steadies the bowl and prepares another spoonful. "Thank you, my sweet; it comforts me so much to feel you near, even as these old fingers struggle." ——Grandmother

As Red poured the broth, she scanned her grandmother's features, noting a peculiar sharpness to the gaze and an odd stiffness in the way she accepted the meal.

The cottage, usually a haven, felt strangely silent and thick with unease, but Red pressed on, determined to fulfill her task.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the wind rattled the shutters, carrying with it the faint echo of a disturbance Red could not yet name. As unease settled deeper into her bones, the memory of her grandmother’s familiar warmth seemed suddenly distant, almost unreachable. Meanwhile, beyond the threshold, unseen forces were already at work—shadows shifting, intentions darkening, and the cottage’s fragile peace on the verge of shattering.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Breaks Into Grandmother’s House

The Wolf, driven by hunger and cunning, approaches Grandmother's cottage, his senses alert for signs of vulnerability.

Pausing at the door, he chooses not to mimic a pitiful whimper but instead adopts the persona of a weary traveler, appealing to Grandmother's compassion and sense of hospitality.

Grandmother, frail and trusting but wary due to her poor eyesight, calls out for the visitor to identify themselves.

The Wolf answers in a gentle, pleading tone, claiming to be cold and alone, seeking only a moment's warmth.

Grandmother, moved by sympathy and her innate kindness, hesitates at the door, torn between caution and the desire to help.

The Wolf patiently waits for her to let down her guard, planning to strike once he is welcomed inside.

The confrontation is set not by stealthy entry, but by the Wolf's manipulation of Grandmother's empathy, setting the stage for his next move.

----------------------------------------

With the grandmother safely out of sight and her cozy home now under his control, the wolf wastes no time slipping into her clothes, transforming his appearance with chilling precision. The cottage, once a haven, becomes a trap as he rehearses his deception, eager for the unsuspecting visitor he knows will soon arrive. Outside, the forest stirs with Red’s approaching footsteps—a new target for the wolf’s cunning, and the next phase of his sinister plan begins to unfold.

# Chapter 2: The Wolf Stalks and Approaches Red

Red adjusted the wicker basket on her arm, careful not to jostle the jar of broth inside, as she stepped over a tangled root.

She paused, lost in thought, her mind swirling with uncertainty about her journey and the legends she’d heard.

The old key, rumored to hold secrets in the forest, lingered in her thoughts, making her question whether her path was truly straightforward.

As she examined a cluster of wild violets, she wondered if the stories about the key were more than fairy tales—perhaps clues she’d overlooked.

Suddenly, the underbrush rustled nearby;

a large grey wolf stepped into view, its fur bristling with dew, amber eyes fixed on Red.

The Wolf halted a few paces away, lowering its head in a mimicry of curiosity, and spoke in a low, smooth voice, 'Good day, little one.

Where are you bound to so early?

' Red gripped the basket tighter, hesitating, but remembered her mother’s advice to be polite to strangers.

'I’m visiting my grandmother, sir, she lives in the cottage just past the birch grove.

' Distracted by her questions about the key, Red’s uncertainty was palpable in her voice.

Red brushes a strand of hair behind her ear and glances over her shoulder, listening to the quiet rustle of leaves. "I wish I felt as sure as I pretend to be. Every step forward seems to echo with questions I can't quite answer. Maybe the trees remember the way better than I do. What if I'm just wandering in circles, hoping for something to change?" ——Red

Red draws in a steadying breath, glancing up at the shifting patterns of light above her, then takes a tentative step forward. "Still, standing still feels worse than moving, even if I'm not sure where the path is taking me." ——Red

The Wolf inched closer, ears pricked and tail flicking, sniffing the air to catch the scent of the food.

It nodded, feigning interest, and asked, 'Is your grandmother expecting you?

' Red nodded, shifting her feet on the soft, leaf-littered path.

The Wolf circled slowly, calculating, its gaze never leaving Red’s face.

Red leans forward, eyes narrowed in thought, turning the mysterious key over in their hand. "Why does that old key keep turning up in all the stories around here? Is there something I'm missing, some secret it's hiding?" ——Red

Red paces slowly, frowning in thought, turning the key over and over in their hand. "Could it be that the key isn't just a prop, but actually opens something real—something important?" ——Red

Red traces the intricate designs on the key, eyes narrowed in concentration. "What if every legend about this key is a clue, and I've been overlooking the pattern all along?" ——Red

Red kept her eyes on the path ahead, determined to move on, but the Wolf blocked her way, insisting, 'The forest is full of surprises.

Perhaps you’d like to pick some flowers for your dear grandmother?

' Red’s curiosity sparked;

she glanced at the wildflowers, torn between caution and the chance to brighten her grandmother’s day, and the lingering mystery of the key and its legends.

The Wolf stepped aside, gesturing with its muzzle toward a sunlit patch of blooms, already planning its next move as Red crouched to gather a handful.

The Wolf’s patient watchfulness, Red’s conflicted hesitance, and the hush of the forest set the tense rhythm of their encounter, with Red’s inner questions about the key adding a new layer of intrigue to her journey.

----------------------------------------

As Red stood among the wildflowers, the wolf’s presence lingered in her thoughts, casting subtle doubt over the path she had chosen. The forest seemed to hold its breath, and Red found herself hurrying along the winding trail toward her grandmother’s cottage, the mysterious key clutched tightly in her hand. With each step, uncertainty grew, and soon Red would discover that the secrets she carried were not hers alone—her grandmother had sensed danger long before Red’s arrival.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives Grandmother’s Warning

Red stands on the worn stone step, her mother handing her a folded cloth of warm bread and repeating firm warnings about the dangers lurking in the forest—stay on the path, speak to no one, ignore strange sounds.

Red promises to remember, but her dialogue reveals an immediate internal conflict: she is openly tempted by the idea of venturing off the path, voicing her curiosity and considering a quick peek into the woods.

Mother stands at the edge of the path, her hand gently resting on Red's shoulder as she locks eyes with her, her expression serious and protective. "Red, listen to me carefully. The forest is full of hidden dangers. You must stay on the path at all times—do not wander, no matter how curious you feel. Do not speak to anyone you don't know, and if you hear anything unusual—strange voices, odd noises—you must ignore them and keep walking. Promise me you'll remember these rules." ——Mother

She weighs the risks—wondering if straying could endanger her grandmother—yet her desire for adventure is palpable.

As she steps toward the forest, Red is less resolved than in the original plot, expressing both her intent to help and her urge to explore, setting up a greater likelihood that she might stray early in her journey.

Red hesitates at the edge of the trail, clutching her basket tightly. Her eyes flicker between the familiar, safe path and the mysterious, twisting trail that disappears into the woods. "I know I should stay on the path—Grandmother depends on me to bring her this basket safely. But… what if there’s something wonderful waiting just beyond those trees? I promised to remember the warning, but my feet keep wanting to wander." ——Red

Red hesitates at the edge of the path, glancing back before taking a tentative step toward the shadowed trail. "Maybe just a quick peek won’t hurt—after all, I’ll still get to Grandmother soon enough." ——Red

Red hesitates at the fork, clutching the basket tighter, her eyes darting between the inviting shadows of the forest and the familiar safety of the path. "But what if the warning was for something real—if I stray, could I put Grandmother in danger too?" ——Red

Mother watches anxiously, perhaps sensing Red’s wavering resolve, and double-checks the door behind her.

----------------------------------------

As the door clicks shut behind her, Red stands alone at the edge of the woods, the weight of her mother’s warning pressing against her curiosity. The path ahead seems reassuring, yet the allure of a shortcut tugs at her thoughts, growing harder to resist with each hesitant step. Soon, a single decision will set her journey on an unexpected course, drawing her deeper into the forest than she ever intended.

# Chapter 3: Red Makes a Fateful Detour

Red adjusted the wicker basket on her arm, glancing at the winding trail ahead.

She stopped to peer into the shadowed thicket, fingers brushing the rough bark of a nearby pine.

The Wolf emerged from behind a fallen log, ears pricked, nose twitching as he circled her with deliberate slowness.

He suggested a shortcut through the elderberry grove, painting it as safer, smoother, and quicker than the main path, and emphasized his familiarity with it, even claiming to know Red's Grandmother.

The Wolf brushes the undergrowth aside with his tail, his golden eyes glinting with a mix of reassurance and sly amusement, waiting to see if his companion will follow. "Trust me, this way is quicker—those brambles only look fierce to strangers. I've run these trails since I was a pup. The main path winds three times as far and with half the cover. Through the elderberries, we'll be out of sight, and no one who'd mean us harm dares the thorns. Unless, of course, you'd rather take your chances out in the open?" ——The Wolf

Red hesitated, recalling her mother's warnings, but her internal conflict grew stronger as she considered the possibility of missing something important by always being cautious.

Red lingers at the edge of the forest, glancing back toward her mother, her fingers tightening around the basket as uncertainty flickers across her face. "Mama said not to stray from the path or talk to strangers, but—what if someone really needs help? What if I miss something important just because I'm being careful?" ——Red

Mother gently tucks a strand of hair behind Red's ear, her eyes searching Red's face for understanding and lingering concern. "My darling, I know your heart is kind, but the world beyond this path is not always safe—promise me you'll remember why I worry, and trust that sometimes caution is the greatest kindness you can give yourself." ——Mother

Through imagined exchanges with her Mother, Red's yearning to prove her maturity and independence came to the fore, matched by her desire to help others and bring joy to her Grandmother.

The Wolf, sensing her indecision, reassured her further, offering to help her pick flowers for her Grandmother along the shortcut.

The Wolf tilts his head, voice soft and honeyed, nose brushing aside a leafy branch to reveal a narrow trail, his amber eyes fixed warmly on Red, inviting trust. "Ah, little one, you look weary already. The path you know is long and winding, tangled with brambles and shadows. But if you take this way—just here, beneath these gentle branches—it’s safer, smoother, and you’ll reach your dear Grandmother’s cottage before the sun even dips low. I know these woods as well as my own fur; you have my word, it’s the best way." ——The Wolf

Red peers down the suggested shortcut, her basket clutched to her chest, uncertainty flickering across her face. "Oh, I didn’t know there was another path—are you sure it leads to Grandmother’s cottage?" ——Red

The Wolf lowers his head, his eyes warm and earnest, gesturing invitingly toward the dappled shortcut with a gentle sweep of his tail. "Indeed, little miss, I walk these woods every day, and I often see your Grandmother tending her roses just beyond that bend—why, I could almost smell her baking from here." ——The Wolf

Red steps closer to the shadowed path, peering between the trees with a mixture of curiosity and uncertainty, her basket held tight against her side. "Really? I suppose Grandmother would be happy if I arrived sooner, and the woods do seem quieter this way." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head encouragingly, gesturing with his snout to the lush, flower-strewn shortcut, his eyes warm and inviting. "Trust me, child, your Grandmother will be delighted to see you early—and think how pleased she’ll be when you bring her fresh flowers from along this peaceful path." ——The Wolf

Red glances uncertainly down the shortcut, clutching her basket a little tighter as she steps closer to the edge of the path. "Well, I do want to pick her the prettiest bouquet, and if this way is truly safe." ——Red

The Wolf steps forward, gently brushing aside a cluster of wildflowers, his eyes watchful as he gestures invitingly down the hidden trail. "Of course, little one, nothing stirs here but the breeze—why not let me show you which blooms your Grandmother loves best?" ——The Wolf

Red steps hesitantly toward the shortcut, glancing back at the main path before letting her basket sway at her side. "All right, I suppose it couldn’t hurt to pick some flowers if you’ll show me where to find the nicest ones." ——Red

Red, still torn but swayed by the Wolf's words and her own wish to be seen as grown-up, agreed to follow him through the elderberry grove, justifying her choice as a way to make her Grandmother happy and show her own resourcefulness.

Red hesitates at the edge of the path, fingers brushing the rough bark of a tree, torn between the thrill of independence and the echo of her mother's warnings. "If I take the shortcut, I'll get home so much faster—and maybe then they'll stop thinking of me as just a kid. But. Mama always says the woods are dangerous because of the wolves. Is it really that risky, or is she just worried I'll never grow up?" ——Red

Mother's voice echoes in Red's memory, her words laced with both tenderness and warning as Red hesitates at the tangled entrance to the shortcut. "Red, remember, being brave doesn't mean ignoring danger—it means knowing when to listen to those who care about you." ——Mother

Red hesitates at the edge of the shortcut, glancing back over her shoulder as if weighing her mother's words against her own longing for independence. "But if I always do exactly as I'm told, how will I ever prove that I can take care of myself?" ——Red

Mother gently places her hand on Red's shoulder, her gaze steady and full of concern. "You prove your strength not by rushing headlong into danger, Red, but by showing wisdom in the choices you make." ——Mother

The Wolf silently padded ahead, his tail low and movements calculated, waiting to see if she would indeed follow.

----------------------------------------

As Red hesitated at the edge of the path, her heart pounded with a mix of excitement and uncertainty. The woods ahead seemed darker, the air taut with possibility and risk. With a final glance back toward the safer, well-worn route, she stepped into the shadows, letting curiosity guide her steps. Little did she know that each stride brought her closer not only to her grandmother’s cottage, but to a dangerous encounter that would test her courage in ways she could never have imagined.

# Chapter 6: Red Confronts the Wolf

Red steps onto the creaking porch, her boots scraping against gritty stone as she knocks on the warped wooden door.

A muffled voice calls from inside—hoarse, unfamiliar, but insisting it is her grandmother.

The WolfThe wolf coughs, voice raspy and faltering, then clears its throat awkwardly, attempting to sound gentle yet urgent. Shadows flicker behind the door as the wolf shifts, trying to position itself where it cannot be easily seen. "Ah, my dear, is that you? Come closer, child, my voice is not what it used to be. Age has made me weak—so weak. You know how your poor grandmother struggles to speak these days. Step inside, won't you? I need to see your sweet face. come just a bit nearer, so I can hold your hand. It's so cold in here, and I am all alone." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, pushing open the door into the dim cottage where the hearth glows weakly and shadows cluster in the corners.

The Wolf, disguised beneath Grandmother’s shawl, sits propped in the bed, narrow eyes fixed on Red.

Red sets her basket down, nose wrinkling at the sharp, musky smell in the room, and inches closer, studying the figure’s oddly large hands clutching the quilt.

She asks, voice trembling, about the size of 'Grandmother’s' eyes and teeth.

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tightly, her gaze flickering nervously to the shadowed contours of 'Grandmother’s' face. "Grandmother, why. why are your eyes so big? They weren't like that before, were they?" ——Red

Red clutches her basket tighter, her voice wavering as she slowly inches backward, her wide eyes fixed on the unnerving smile before her. "And your teeth. they're so sharp, Grandmother—have they always been like that?" ——Red

The Wolf leans forward, lips curling, and finally lunges, shedding the shawl.

Red stumbles backward, knocking over a stool as she scrambles for the door, the Wolf’s claws scraping across the floorboards.

The confrontation forces Red to recognize the Wolf’s true nature and triggers her desperate escape.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the chaos inside the cottage spills into the stillness of the woods, echoing through the trees. As Red’s frantic struggle rattles the tiny home, help draws near—unaware of the danger within. In the growing twilight, footsteps approach, and the fate of all inside the cottage hangs in the balance.

# Chapter 7: The Huntsman Intervenes

Red, clutching her wicker basket, stands frozen at the foot of Grandmother's bed as the Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightgown, bares his teeth, revealing his true identity.

Red takes a hesitant step closer, her grip tightening on the basket, eyes darting between the Wolf's face and the shadows of the room. "Grandmother? Is that really you? Your voice sounds so. rough, and your eyes—they look much bigger than I remember." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, the nightcap slipping slightly, revealing a glint of yellowed fang beneath his lips. "Ah, my dear, the better to see you with—these old eyes have grown keen in the twilight of age." ——The Wolf

Red takes a hesitant step closer, her grip tightening on the basket as she peers uncertainly at the figure in the bed. "And Grandmother, what big ears you have—so pointed and tall beneath your cap!" ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, his ears twitching, as his gaze darkens, never leaving Red. "The better to hear you with, child; the woods have made me listen for every whisper and footstep." ——The Wolf

Red shrinks back a step, clutching her basket tighter as her eyes widen with dawning fear. "But Grandmother, what big teeth you have—so sharp and shining in the candlelight!" ——Red

The Wolf grins wide, lunging from the bed as Red stumbles back in horror, her basket tumbling to the floor. "The better to eat you with, my dear!" ——The Wolf

The Wolf taunts Red, relishing her fear and asserting his dominance, but Red finds a spark of defiance and courage, insisting she will fight back.

The Wolf lunges forward, claws raking the quilt as he snaps his jaws inches from Red's face, his eyes gleaming with hunger and malice. "You thought you could outsmart me, little Red? Now there's nowhere left to run!" ——The Wolf

Red stumbles backward, clutching the edge of the quilt, her eyes wide with terror as the Wolf's teeth flash inches from her face. "Please, stay back! I—I didn't mean to anger you!" ——Red

The Wolf bares his teeth in a savage grin and lunges closer, his hot breath brushing Red's cheek as she shrinks back against the headboard. "Too late for apologies, girl—I've been hungry far too long!" ——The Wolf

Red stumbles backward, clutching the edge of the bed, her eyes wide with terror as the Wolf's teeth gleam inches from her face. "No—someone help!" ——Red

The Wolf bares his teeth, saliva dripping as he lunges forward, casting a monstrous shadow over Red. "No one will hear your cries, Red—you're mine now!" ——The Wolf

Red scrambles backward, her heart pounding as she clutches the quilt, eyes wide with terror as the Wolf's jaws snap inches from her face. "No—get away from me!" ——Red

The Wolf bares his teeth, lunging closer as Red scrambles backwards, clutching the quilt in terror. "Scream all you want—I'll savor every moment!" ——The Wolf

Red grabs a heavy candlestick from the bedside table and swings it desperately at the Wolf's snout. "I won't let you hurt me!" ——Red

The Wolf bares his teeth, advancing with a guttural growl as his shadow looms over Red. "Brave words for trembling prey—let's see how long your courage lasts!" ——The Wolf

Red grabs a corner of the quilt and swings it desperately at the Wolf's snapping jaws, her eyes wide with fear and determination. "You won't win—I'll fight with everything I have!" ——Red

The Wolf bares his fangs, lunging closer as his shadow looms over Red, claws poised to strike. "Fight all you want—your fear only makes the hunt sweeter!" ——The Wolf

As the Wolf closes in, the cottage door bursts open—pine-scented air and the sharp tang of gunpowder fill the room as the Huntsman storms in, axe raised.

The Wolf, cornered, refuses to surrender quietly, trading threats with the Huntsman.

Red, torn between her compassion and fear, pleads for mercy on the Wolf's behalf, questioning the morality of violence even as her safety is at stake.

The Wolf bares his teeth, hackles raised, eyes darting between the window and the Huntsman's gleaming axe, muscles tensed for another desperate leap. "Stay back! I won't go quietly into your trap!" ——The Wolf

The Huntsman steps forward, axe raised and eyes locked on the Wolf, cutting off any path to the window. "You've caused enough harm, Wolf—you're not slipping through my fingers this time." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares his teeth, muscles coiled, eyes darting between the window and the Huntsman's poised weapon. "You think your axe scares me, Huntsman? I'll tear my way out if I must!" ——The Wolf

The Huntsman tightens his grip on the axe, planting his boots between the Wolf and the window, muscles tensed for the next move. "You won't lay another paw on anyone—stand down, or I'll make sure you regret every step you've taken." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares his teeth, crouching low before lunging toward the window, claws scraping desperately against the sill. "You'll have to catch me first!" ——The Wolf

The Huntsman lunges forward, axe raised, cutting off the Wolf's path to the window. "I've hunted beasts fiercer than you, Wolf—this ends now!" ——The Huntsman

The Huntsman, unwavering in his duty, insists on protecting Red at any cost, even if it means bearing her resentment.

Red clings to the chair, her voice trembling as she glances desperately between the Huntsman and the Wolf, her body half-turned as if ready to bolt, eyes wide with terror. "Please—don't hurt him! He. he hasn't done anything yet! Just let us go, both of us!" ——Red

The Huntsman steps between Red and the Wolf, axe raised and eyes locked on the trembling beast. "Stay back, Red—he's fooled you once, he won't get the chance again." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares his fangs, bracing himself low against the wall, eyes darting between Red and the advancing Huntsman. "You think you know what I am, Huntsman, but you forget—even cornered, a wolf still has teeth." ——The Wolf

Red's voice trembles as she steps between the Huntsman and the Wolf, her gaze flicking desperately from one to the other, hands raised in a futile barrier. "Red: If you kill him, what does that make you?" ——Red

The Huntsman steps between Red and the Wolf, axe raised, eyes never leaving the trembling creature in the shadows. "It makes me the one who chose to save you, no matter what it costs." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares his fangs, hackles raised, inching sideways along the wall as his eyes dart between Red and the Huntsman, searching for any chance to escape—or strike. "And if you force my hand, girl, you'll see just how sharp those teeth can be." ——The Wolf

Red stands trembling between them, her voice quivering but her eyes fierce as she blocks the Huntsman's path, desperation forcing courage. "Red: Then maybe I’d rather face his teeth than watch you become a monster, too." ——Red

The Huntsman tightens his grip on his axe, stepping between Red and the Wolf, his posture rigid and unwavering as he watches the Wolf's every twitch. "If protecting you means bearing your hatred, Red, I'll take it—because monsters are made by what they do, not what they're called." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf, sensing Red's inner conflict, attempts to manipulate her further, warning that the woods and their mysteries linger beyond this moment.

The Wolf's gaze lingers on Red, a mix of longing and remorse flickering in his eyes as he backs away, the Huntsman stepping between them, axe raised, protective and unyielding. "You think you've won, Huntsman, but the story isn't finished—not while her heart still beats with curiosity. Red, remember: the woods whisper more than warnings." ——The Wolf

Red steps back, shrouded in the Huntsman's protective shadow, her hand trembling at her cloak. "I hold the Wolf’s gaze, fear and defiance tangled inside me, wondering if his secrets will haunt me long after the woods fall silent." ——Red

The HuntsmanMy hand rests reassuringly on Red's shoulder as I meet the Wolf's eyes, cutting off his final, lingering glance with a barrier of resolve. "I step between Red and the Wolf, voice low but unwavering—'Your haunt ends here; she walks free, and your shadows die with the day.'" ——The Huntsman

Ultimately, the Huntsman physically interposes himself between Red and the Wolf, ensuring Red's safety as he binds the Wolf.

Red's voice quivers as she hugs herself tightly, her wide eyes fixed on the subdued Wolf, searching the Huntsman's face for comfort and assurance. "Is it. is it really over? I can still hear its growl in my head." ——Red

The Huntsman binds the Wolf securely, casting a firm, protective glance at Red before dragging the subdued creature away from the center of the room. "It's over, Red—you’re safe now; the Wolf won’t harm you again, I promise." ——The Huntsman

The Wolf bares its teeth in a twisted grin, even as the iron binds bite into its fur. "You think chains can hold me? Fear lingers, Red, long after the door is shut." ——The Wolf

Red's hands twist the fabric of her cloak as she glances nervously at the Wolf, her voice barely above a whisper. "But what if it comes back—what if I’m never safe again?" ——Red

The Huntsman tightens the final lock on the Wolf’s restraints, then places a reassuring hand on Red’s shoulder, his presence steady and protective. "You’re stronger than you know, Red, and I’ll stand watch—no shadow or growl will breach this cottage again." ——The Huntsman

Red remains conflicted, haunted by the encounter and uncertain whether true safety is possible, but the Huntsman reassures her that she is stronger than she realizes, and he will protect her from future threats.

The cottage, once a place of fear, now holds a tense, uneasy peace as Red grapples with the aftermath of her ordeal and the Huntsman's difficult choices.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the forest seems quieter, but the echoes of danger still linger in Red’s mind. As the group tends to their wounds and attempts to restore order within the cottage, Red finds herself at a crossroads, wrestling with memories that refuse to fade. The events of the night have changed her, and as dawn approaches, Red must decide how to move forward in a world forever altered by fear and survival.

# Chapter 8: Aftermath and Red’s Decision

Red sits at the small kitchen table, her hands wrapped tightly around a chipped mug as she stirs honey into her grandmother's tea.

Mother stands across from her, arms crossed, her eyes tracing the mud stains on Red's cloak and the scratch on her cheek.

Mother briskly closes the door against the chill and steps closer, her voice low and firm as she asks Red to recount what happened in the forest.

Mother shuts the door with a decisive click, wrapping her shawl tighter as she steps close, her eyes searching Red’s face for answers. "Red, look at me—what did you see out there? Tell me everything, and don’t leave anything out." ——Mother

Red wraps her arms tightly around herself, her eyes wide with fear as she stares at the floor, voice trembling. "I—I heard footsteps behind me, not animal ones, and then I saw a shadow moving between the trees—it was following me, but it disappeared when I ran." ——Red

Mother grips Red's shoulders gently, searching her eyes for any sign of deception or detail she might have missed. "Are you certain it wasn't a villager or a hunter—Red, did you recognize anything about the figure at all?" ——Mother

Red hugs her cloak tighter, shivering as she glances nervously toward the window. "No, Mother—it was too tall, and its eyes caught the moonlight like glass; I don't think it was human." ——Red

Mother draws the curtains tight, her hands trembling as she peers out into the darkness, searching for any sign of movement. "Mother: Then we must bolt every window and keep to the hearth—did you sense it meant you harm, or did it try to speak?" ——Mother

Red shudders and wraps her arms tightly around herself, glancing anxiously at the shuttered windows. "It didn't speak, but it reached toward me with something in its hand—a bundle wrapped in red cloth." ——Red

Mother's eyes narrow, her hands tightening on Red's shoulders as she searches her daughter's face for the truth. "Mother: Show me exactly where you saw it, Red—did you bring the bundle home, or leave it in the forest?" ——Mother

Red wrings her hands together, her eyes flickering with fear as she glances toward the window, as if expecting the shadow to appear again. "I left it there—I was too frightened to touch it, but I remember the spot, just beyond the old birch stump." ——Red

Mother places both hands firmly on Red’s shoulders, her eyes intent and unwavering, as if bracing her daughter—and herself—for what lies ahead. "Then we’ll go together at first light—there’s something in that forest that wants to be found." ——Mother

Red, voice trembling, describes hearing footsteps behind her and seeing a tall, shadowy figure with eyes shining in the moonlight, which followed her and disappeared when she ran.

Red’s voice falters as she looks down at her scraped knuckles, her hands trembling in her lap. She blinks back tears, guilt and fear etched into her face. "I—I didn’t mean to stray, I just wanted to pick some flowers for Grandma. I thought it would only take a moment. But then. he was there—the Wolf. He seemed so kind at first, asking me where I was going, smiling as if he cared. I told him everything. And now—" ——Red

Red's hands tighten around her basket, her eyes glistening with tears as she hugs it close to her chest. "Now I can't stop thinking about how easily I trusted him, and how everything went so wrong because I left the path." ——Red

She tells Mother the figure reached out with a bundle wrapped in red cloth, but she was too frightened to touch it and left it beyond the old birch stump.

Mother lifts Red's chin, inspecting her face for scrapes, her fingers gentle as she brushes a smudge of dirt from Red's cheek. She sighs, her brow furrowed with worry. "Red, look at me. I told you—never leave the path. You know how dangerous the woods can be. What if something had happened? You could have been hurt." ——Mother

Red lowers her gaze, twisting her fingers together as she tries to explain herself, her voice small but earnest. "I’m sorry, Mother—I just thought I saw something in the trees, and I didn’t mean to worry you." ——Red

Mother’s voice tightens, but she smooths Red’s hair back from her forehead, her touch lingering with unspoken relief. "Thought isn’t enough to keep you safe, Red—you must listen, even when you’re curious." ——Mother

Red lowers her eyes, voice quiet, her fingers twisting the edge of her cloak as Mother gently smooths the dirt from her sleeve. "I know, but I didn’t want to ignore it if someone needed help." ——Red

Mother smooths Red's hair, her fingers trembling ever so slightly as she fights to steady her voice. "There are times to help and times to heed warnings, Red—my worry is not just for you, but for what waits beyond the path." ——Mother

Mother questions whether it could have been a villager or hunter, but Red insists it did not seem human.

Deciding they must bolt the windows and keep to the hearth, Mother says they will return to the spot together at first light.

Mother gently presses a folded clean cloth into Red’s palm and kneels down beside the scattered fruit, beginning to mop up the spilled juice and gather the bruised apples. "Here, Red—hold this tight and help me blot up the juice before it stains. We’ll get this sorted, don’t worry." ——Mother

Red presses the cloth to the spill, her shoulders hunched as she glances at Mother's face, searching for forgiveness. "Okay, Mother, I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to knock it over." ——Red

Mother crouches beside Red, guiding her hand as they dab at the spilled juice together, her tone gentle despite the frustration flickering in her eyes. "It's all right, dear—accidents happen; just press gently, like this, and we'll have it cleaned in no time." ——Mother

Red then confesses she left the path to pick flowers for Grandma and encountered the Wolf, who seemed kind but deceived her.

She expresses regret for trusting the Wolf and for straying.

Mother admonishes Red for her risky curiosity but comforts her as they work together to clean up the spilled basket.

Both move carefully around the room, their actions deliberate, navigating the new tension and understanding between them.

----------------------------------------

As dawn crept softly through the shutters, Red and her mother stood side by side, stronger for what had passed, ready to face whatever waited beyond the path—together.
