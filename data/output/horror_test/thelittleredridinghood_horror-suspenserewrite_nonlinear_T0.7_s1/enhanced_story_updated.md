# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Senses Something Wrong

Red steps cautiously along the muddy path, clutching a basket wrapped in cloth, and scans the uneven clearing where her grandmother's cabin sits.

She pauses to listen, noting the absence of her grandmother's usual humming and the strange creak of the front door swinging slightly ajar.

Driven by her responsibility to deliver medicine, Red approaches and knocks lightly, her knuckles brushing against rough wood.

From inside, a voice—unusually deep and raspy—calls out for her to enter, claiming to be her grandmother.

The WolfThe wolf clears its throat, trying to soften the gravelly tone, but the deep rasp lingers, echoing strangely through the small cottage. "Come in, my dear. it's your grandmother, waiting for you. Don't be shy, child. The door is open." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, peering through the half-open door, and notices thick, coarse fur tangled around the doorknob and muddy footprints trailing toward the bed.

Determined to help, Red steps into the cabin, setting the basket on the table as she glances warily toward the shadowed figure beneath the quilt.

The wolf, hidden in the bed and motivated by hunger and deception, mimics the grandmother's speech, urging Red to come closer to 'see her better.

The WolfThe wolf nestles deeper into the bed, pulling the covers up to his chin and softening his voice to mimic the grandmother, his eyes glinting hungrily as he watches Red hesitate at the doorway. "Come closer, my dear. The light is so dim—I can hardly see your sweet face. Let Grandmother have a better look at you." ——The Wolf

' Red moves slowly, her eyes flicking between the unfamiliar shape beneath the covers and the remnants of a broken teacup on the floor, piecing together the oddities as she inches forward.

----------------------------------------

A tense silence hangs in the air as Red’s instincts scream at her to turn back, but something deeper urges her to uncover the truth. Each cautious step brings her closer to the bed—and to the unsettling certainty that the figure lying there is not her grandmother. With her grip tightening on the poker, Red steels herself for what comes next, knowing she can no longer ignore the danger that lurks beneath the familiar quilts.

# Chapter 6: Red Confronts the Impostor

Red enters the cabin and immediately senses something is amiss, voicing her suspicions aloud and questioning the figure in the bed with increasing directness.

Instead of simply hesitating and stalling for time, Red actively interrogates the disguised Wolf, noting not just physical oddities but also strange odors, gestures, and behaviors.

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her fingers clutching the basket as she peers at the shrouded figure, her voice edged with uncertainty. "Grandmother.? Are you feeling alright? The room is so dark, and you look different somehow. Why are you wearing your bonnet so low over your face?" ——Red

The WolfThe figure’s voice is rougher than Red remembers, muffled beneath the covers, and a clawed hand pats the bed invitingly. "The better to keep the drafts off my poor old head, dear child—come closer so I can see you more clearly." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, squinting into the shadows, her hands twisting nervously in her apron. "Your voice sounds raspy, Grandmother—have you caught a cold, or is something else the matter?" ——Red

The Wolf pats the edge of the bed with a trembling, oddly large hand hidden beneath the covers, eyes glinting from beneath the bonnet's shadow. "Oh, it's just a touch of the chill, my dear—nothing that a visit from you won't cure; now, won't you come sit by my side so I can hold your hand?" ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, squinting at the shadowy figure, her hand hovering uncertainly above the blankets. "Your hands look so large and. furry, Grandmother—are you sure you're alright?" ——Red

The Wolf shifts beneath the blankets, extending a paw-like hand toward Red, the clawed fingers barely concealed by the fraying edge of the sleeve. "The better to embrace you with, my sweet—don't be frightened, it's only the shadows playing tricks on your eyes." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her grip tightening on her basket as she peers anxiously at the bonneted figure, heart pounding with dread. "But your eyes—they seem so big and bright, almost glowing in the gloom—why do they look so strange, Grandmother?" ——Red

The WolfThe figure shifts beneath the blankets, a sharp glint flickering in the depths where eyes ought to be, as one clawed hand inches closer to the edge of the bed. "The better to see you with, my darling—old eyes need all the help they can get in such dim light." ——The Wolf

Red hesitates, her fingers tightening around the basket as she edges back, eyes locked on the grin glinting beneath the bonnet. "And your teeth—so sharp and pointed, Grandmother, I've never noticed them before—why do you look so hungry?" ——Red

The Wolf lunges forward, casting off the blankets and bonnet in a sudden, predatory movement that reveals his true nature. "The better to eat you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

She voices her doubts repeatedly, referencing her mother's warnings and clearly suspects that the figure before her may not be her grandmother.

As the Wolf grows more insistent and revealing in its responses, Red shifts from passive caution to active strategizing, scanning for makeshift weapons and formulating a plan to defend herself.

Red pauses on the path, glancing nervously over her shoulder, and pulls her red cloak tighter around herself. "That's strange. it doesn't smell like Grandma's usual rosemary and thyme. What is that? Maybe it's just the wind carrying something from the woods. Still. I should be careful." ——Red

Red glances nervously at the door, her grip tightening on the basket as she debates whether to call out or stay silent. "But what if Grandma's not alone—what if something's happened?" ——Red

Red steadies herself, glancing nervously at the door before taking a cautious step forward, her grip on the basket tightening. "No, I shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I have to be ready for anything—just in case." ——Red

The Wolf, feeling its deception slip, becomes alternately defensive and aggressive, attempting to maintain its disguise while letting more predatory intent show through.

Red runs her fingers lightly over the gouged wood, her brow furrowing as she glances at the mug shards glittering on the floor. "Those claw marks weren’t here before. And the mug—someone left in a hurry, or something scared them off. Did it come back last night? No, no, I would’ve heard. Unless it’s getting bolder." ——Red

Red steps back from the bed, scanning the shadows for movement, her hand hovering near the pocket where she keeps her knife. "This doesn’t feel right—if it’s getting bolder, I need to be ready for whatever comes next." ——Red

The confrontation escalates into a tense verbal sparring match, with Red openly challenging the Wolf's explanations and the Wolf growing increasingly impatient and ominous.

The Wolf curls its lips into a crooked smile beneath the covers, one paw—far too large for a frail old woman—trembling as it beckons the girl to the bedside. "Come closer, dear, so I can see you better. My eyes aren’t what they used to be, and I’ve been waiting all day for your sweet company." ——The Wolf

The Wolf pats the bed with a heavy paw, the nails barely hidden beneath the blanket, voice trembling with eager anticipation. "My, how your rosy cheeks glow in this dim light—why not sit right here beside me, child?" ——The Wolf

The Wolf subtly shifts beneath the covers, its paw inching forward with a tremor masked as affection. "Your scent fills the room so warmly, little one—would you mind leaning in, just a touch closer, so I may bask in your comforting presence?" ——The Wolf

The Wolf pats the bed beside it with a trembling paw, teeth barely hidden behind a strained smile as it tries to appear inviting. "And what a lovely basket you carry, my dear—won't you let me have just a little taste of what you've brought, to ease my rumbling hunger?" ——The Wolf

The Wolf lifts its massive head slightly from the pillow, the covers shifting as its jaws clench in anticipation. "Ah, but it’s your tender voice I crave most—come whisper your secrets in my ear, so I may savor every syllable." ——The Wolf

The chapter sets up an imminent confrontation, with Red more actively on guard and prepared to fight rather than simply stalling or being paralyzed by fear.

Red hesitates, shifting her basket from one arm to the other, her feet planted firmly just beyond the Wolf’s reach. Her eyes narrow, wary, as she tries to sound polite while keeping her distance. "Mother always said not to trust strangers in the woods. especially ones with such big teeth. Why are you smiling at me like that?" ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, widening his grin just enough to flash those teeth, while his eyes remain fixed on Red, unblinking. "Oh, my dear, a friendly smile is all I have to offer a weary traveler—wouldn't you say it's better to meet kindness than suspicion in these lonely woods?" ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, taking an instinctive step back as her eyes flicker warily between the Wolf's face and the shadowy undergrowth. "Kindness, perhaps—but I've also learned that not all smiles mean safety." ——Red

The Wolf tilts his head, letting his tongue flick across his teeth in a gesture meant to seem playful, but his eyes remain fixed and unblinking on Red. "Well, my dear, sometimes caution can blind us to the warmth of genuine company; after all, not every creature with sharp teeth intends to bite." ——The Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, edging a step backward, her eyes searching the trees for a safe path. "Maybe so, but it's hard to see warmth behind a mouth that looks ready to snap shut." ——Red

----------------------------------------

The wolf’s facade crumbles as Red’s suspicion deepens, and the tension between them thickens in the dimly lit room. With his true nature exposed, the wolf abandons any pretense of gentleness, his wounded pride fueling a new, menacing intent. As Red backs away, the wolf’s gaze follows her every movement, calculating and cold. The confrontation has shifted—no longer a test of disguises, but a dangerous game of pursuit and interrogation, with Red’s every answer and action under the wolf’s ruthless scrutiny.

# Chapter 2: The Wolf Stalks and Interrogates Red

Red shifted the wicker basket on her arm, her steps cautious as she navigated the dew-slick roots.

A sudden rustle in the undergrowth made her pause, but she pressed on until the path curved around a mossy log.

From the shadows, a large gray wolf emerged, blocking her path.

His yellow eyes fixed on her, and he spoke in a low, articulate voice: 'You’re wary, and with good reason.

But tell me—what trails do the hunters favor at dawn?

I’ve smelled their iron on the wind, and I won’t be caught unawares.

Speak plainly, or I’ll find my answers elsewhere, and you won’t like how I ask.

' Red, clutching her basket tighter and recalling her mother’s warnings, tried to distract the wolf, speaking evasively: 'If you're looking for something, perhaps you should ask directly.

I have little to give, and less to say that would interest a traveler such as yourself.

' The wolf, feigning curiosity but hiding predatory intent, pressed further about her destination and what she carried, probing with increasingly pointed questions.

Red remained resourceful, offering cryptic answers and hinting at danger while refusing to reveal her true errand or her grandmother’s location.

The wolf circled, unsatisfied but intrigued by Red’s cleverness and resolve, his hunger sharpening as he plotted his next move.

Red's voice trembles as she takes a cautious step back, clutching her basket tighter, her eyes darting between the wolf's teeth and the dark path behind her. "I—uh, I didn't mean to disturb you." ——Red

Red clutched her basket tighter, her feet shuffling nervously as she glanced toward the shadowed path behind her. "Maybe I should just go back the way I came." ——Red

Red clutches her basket tighter, her voice wavering as she takes a cautious step backward, eyes never leaving the wolf. "Or, maybe you just want me to leave you alone?" ——Red

The encounter left both wary—Red determined to protect her secret, and the wolf more interested than ever in unraveling it.

Red glances around, muscles tensed, her feet angled subtly toward the nearest path away. She keeps her tone light, but her eyes flicker with apprehension, scanning for exits. "Oh, I—uh, I was just passing through, really. Didn’t expect to run into anyone out here." ——Red

----------------------------------------

As the wolf melted into the shadows, Red heaved a shaky sigh, trying to convince herself the danger had passed. Yet before she could regain her composure, a sudden rustling in the trees reminded her that the forest held more than one source of unease. Just as the wolf’s unsettling presence faded from her thoughts, an unexpected call from her mother would pull her anxieties in a new direction, setting her on a path she could not ignore.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives Her Mother’s Urgent Request

Red stands at the table, weaving a cloth over the food basket as her mother briskly places the medicine vial inside, her fingers moving with practiced care.

Red's mother points toward the woods visible through the open door, voice low and stern as she instructs Red on the safest path and warns her not to stray.

Red stands in the doorway, glancing from her mother's anxious face to the shadowy line of trees, gripping her basket tightly. Her voice is steady, but her eyes linger on the woods, curiosity flickering just beneath her obedient resolve. "I understand, Mother. I'll follow the path like you said—straight to grandmother's, no stopping, no wandering. I promise." ——Red

Red's MotherShe places a firm, reassuring hand on Red's shoulder, her gaze earnest and unwavering. "Remember, Red, keep your eyes on the path; the woods are full of shadows that whisper, and you must not listen, no matter how curious you are." ——Red's Mother

Red glances anxiously toward the trees, clutching her basket a little tighter as she steels herself to leave. "I’ll keep my ears closed to the whispers, Mother—I won’t let anything draw me away." ——Red

Red nods, glancing from her mother’s serious face to the shadowy tree line, then tightens the cloak around her shoulders, gripping the basket handle with determination.

As she steps toward the doorway, her mother gently touches her arm, repeating her warnings about the wolf prowling the woods, making Red pause and memorize the instructions.

Red stops at the threshold, her hand tightening around her basket as she looks back at her mother, nodding slowly to show she understands the gravity of the warnings. She takes a deep breath, replaying her mother’s words in her mind, her eyes serious and attentive. "I know, Mother. I’ll stay on the path, and I won’t talk to anyone I meet. I promise." ——Red

Red's MotherShe squeezes Red's arm just a little tighter, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding, as Red nods solemnly, the weight of her mother’s warning settling deep within her. "I need you to remember, Red—wolves are clever, and danger wears many faces; trust no one but your own heart and my words." ——Red's Mother

Their exchange ends with Red promising to deliver the supplies quickly and safely, her mother watching her leave, arms crossed tightly in concern.

Red shoulders her satchel firmly, standing tall despite her mother’s anxious gaze. "Don’t worry, Mom. I know how important these supplies are—I’ll get them to the village before nightfall, I promise." ——Red

Red's MotherHer mother’s arms tighten around herself, her eyes searching Red’s face for any trace of fear. "I just wish you didn’t have to go alone, Red—the woods are different now, and I worry every time you step out there." ——Red's Mother

Red squeezes her mother's hand, her eyes steady with determination before turning toward the door. "I’ll stay on the main path and be careful, I swear—I'll come back before the moon rises, you’ll see." ——Red

----------------------------------------

The heavy door closes behind Red, and her mother’s anxious gaze lingers long after she disappears into the morning gloom. The familiar world of hearth and home quickly falls away, replaced by the chill and uncertainty of the forest. As Red’s footsteps carry her deeper among the twisted trees and curling mist, each shadow seems to stretch and whisper, hinting at dangers lurking just beyond sight. With every step, she feels the weight of her promise—and the unsettling sense that the woods hold far more than she’s been warned to expect.

# Chapter 3: Red Faces Terrors in the Woods

Red walks along the forest path, her basket held tightly as she navigates roots and listens to the rustle of undergrowth.

Recalling her mother's warnings, she remains cautious but is notably open and polite when she encounters the Wolf.

Instead of hesitating to reveal her destination, Red responds to the Wolf's inquiries with friendly candor, openly telling him she is going to her grandmother's house, describing its location, and sharing details about her grandmother's habits and the unlocked door.

The Wolf, using his cunning, questions Red further about her grandmother's solitude, her own journey, and the timing of her visit, gathering information through subtle conversation.

Red, feeling proud of her devotion and not sensing immediate danger, continues to converse, even mentioning that this journey is usually made with her mother, but today she is alone.

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, offering a polite smile to the wolf, her voice bright and trusting as she steps just a little closer, unaware of the danger lurking beneath his friendly demeanor. "Oh! Hello, Mister Wolf. I’m just going to my grandmother’s house—she lives at the end of this path, past the old willow tree. She’s not feeling well, so I’m bringing her this basket of treats. Isn’t it a lovely day for a walk through the woods?" ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head with feigned curiosity, his eyes glinting as he steps lightly to block more of the path. "Indeed, such a fine day—one might say perfect for a visit; tell me, does your dear grandmother often spend her days alone in that little house beyond the willow?" ——The Wolf

Red tucks a stray curl behind her ear, her gaze earnest and trusting as she shifts the basket in her hands. "Oh, yes—she lives all by herself ever since Grandfather passed, so I try to visit whenever I can, especially when she's feeling poorly." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf leans in closer, eyes glinting with curiosity as he feigns sympathetic concern. "How thoughtful you are, child—surely your grandmother must look forward to your visits, especially when her door stays closed to all but family." ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her face bright with pride but unaware of the wolf’s growing interest. "Oh, she always leaves the door unlocked for me, in case I arrive while she's resting—she says family should never have to wait outside." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head just so, his gaze lingering with feigned admiration, while his claws flex idly in the moss at his feet. "Such trust between kin is rare these days—how fortunate your grandmother is to have someone as devoted as you, and how safe she must feel knowing you could arrive at any hour, unannounced." ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing down the winding path with a shy, uncertain smile. "Thank you, Mister Wolf—I just want her to know she's never alone, even if the woods feel a little lonely sometimes." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head, watching Red closely, his eyes glinting with interest as his words hang in the air. "Ah, but loneliness can be a curious companion—sometimes it lets us hear things in the silence that others might miss." ——The Wolf

Red hugs her basket a little tighter, glancing nervously at the shifting shadows among the branches. "I suppose that's true; sometimes the wind sounds almost like whispers, but I know it's just the trees talking to each other." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head, his eyes glinting as he steps just a fraction closer, voice smooth and inviting. "And sometimes, if one listens closely, the woods will share secrets with those clever enough to ask." ——The Wolf

Red hugs her basket a little tighter, glancing nervously at the dark spaces between the trees. "I never thought of the woods as having secrets—what sorts of things do you think they would tell?" ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head, his eyes glinting with sly curiosity as he studies Red's face for a reaction. "Perhaps they would reveal who passes beneath their boughs and when, or who finds comfort behind a certain unlocked door." ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a little tighter and glances nervously at the shadows between the trees. "I suppose if the woods do keep watch, they must know I'm always careful and never stray from the path." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf tilts his head, eyes narrowing with feigned admiration as he steps just a fraction closer, his gaze fixed intently on Red. "Of course, wise little one—after all, the safest journeys are taken by those who know exactly where they're going and when they'll arrive." ——The Wolf

Red hugs her basket closer, glancing down the trail with a hopeful, trusting smile. "I always follow the path, so I should reach Grandmother's house just before lunchtime." ——Red

The Wolf departs into the trees with a wealth of information, his predatory intent sharpened by Red's openness.

Red glances down at her basket, fingers tightening on the handle, her eyes flickering with uncertainty as she recalls her mother's gentle but firm voice in her mind. "Red (thinking, voice overlapping with a memory): 'Don’t talk to strangers, and never stray from the path…' (aloud, softly) You said to be careful, Mama. I remember." ——Red

Red's MotherHer mother's voice echoes gently in Red's mind, the memory wrapping around her like a protective cloak as she clutches the basket closer to her side. "Always keep your wits about you, darling—what’s in that basket is precious, just like you." ——Red's Mother

Red resumes her journey, comforted by the memory of her mother's advice, but unaware of the risk posed by her candidness.

Red pauses on the narrow forest trail, clutching her basket a little closer. She offers the wolf a polite, slightly nervous smile, her eyes flicking to his sharp teeth before meeting his gaze again. "Oh! Good afternoon, Mister Wolf. You startled me—I didn’t see you there. It’s such a quiet path today. Are you out for a stroll too?" ——Red

The WolfThe wolf circles closer, his head tilted with feigned curiosity, golden eyes fixed on Red as his nose twitches, catching the scent of her basket. "Ah, forgive me, dear child—I meant no fright; the forest is so vast, one’s paws wander where they will." ——The Wolf

The WolfThe wolf lowers his head closer to Red's basket, nostrils flaring subtly as he circles, keeping his tone light and eyes fixed on her face. "And tell me, young traveler, what brings you so deep into these woods on your own—do you not fear what shadows might linger beneath these ancient trees?" ——The Wolf

Red hugs her basket a little tighter and glances down the path, her voice brave but her eyes wary of the wolf’s watchful gaze. "I’m not afraid, really—Mama says as long as I keep to the path and don’t talk to strangers, I’ll be just fine; I’m only bringing this basket to my grandmother’s house, she lives just past the bend where the wild roses grow." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf lowers his head, nostrils flaring as he edges closer, his gaze fixed hungrily on the basket, tail swishing with anticipation. "Ah, what a devoted granddaughter you must be—your grandmother will surely delight in your visit, and such a tempting basket; do you often make this journey all by yourself?" ——The Wolf

Red hugs the basket a little closer, glancing down the path as if to reassure herself of its safety, but her eyes flicker back to the wolf with a touch of curiosity. "Oh, not too often—Mama usually comes with me, but she’s busy baking today, so I promised I’d go straight there and straight home again." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf lowers his head slightly, voice silky, eyes glinting as he takes a measured step closer and lets his tongue flick over his teeth. "How brave you are, little one, to venture alone with only the trees and birds for company—tell me, does your grandmother expect you soon, or might she be surprised by an early visit today?" ——The Wolf

Red hugs her basket close, glancing down the path as if measuring the distance to her grandmother’s cottage, her grip tightening with a hint of unease. "She’ll be surprised, I think—I left as soon as the bread cooled, so I’ll arrive much earlier than usual." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf’s amber eyes narrow slightly, his tail curling behind him as he steps closer, nostrils flaring with the scent of bread and innocence. "How delightful—a surprise can sweeten the day, especially for someone living all alone at the edge of the woods, wouldn’t you say?" ——The Wolf

The WolfThe wolf cocks his head, eyes glinting as he steps closer, his tail swaying with feigned friendliness. "And does your dear grandmother keep anyone else for company, or will she have only you and the birds to greet this afternoon?" ——The Wolf

Red clutches her basket a bit tighter, glancing toward the path ahead, a faint uncertainty flickering in her eyes as the wolf’s questions linger in the air. "Oh, it’s just Grandmother there—she says she likes the quiet, but I think she’ll be glad of a little company today." ——Red

The WolfThe wolf's yellow eyes narrow with interest as he sidles a step closer, his voice low and silky, his nose twitching as if savoring the scent of the bread in Red's basket. "Such a peaceful spot for a gentle soul—how fortunate that you visit her, for in these silent woods, one never knows what unexpected guests might wander by." ——The Wolf

----------------------------------------

As Red disappears deeper into the tangled undergrowth, the woods settle into an uneasy silence, broken only by the fading echoes of her hurried footsteps. Unseen among the shadows, another presence moves with purpose, weaving through the trees with a cunning patience. While Red presses onward, unaware of just how closely she is being hunted, the path ahead leads not just to her grandmother’s door—but to a danger already lurking within.

# Chapter 4: The Wolf Breaks Into Grandmother’s Cabin

As the wind gusts, the latch on the cabin's back window creaks, drawing Grandmother's attention from her bed.

She rises with effort, her hands trembling as she pulls her shawl tighter.

Outside, the Wolf circles the cabin's perimeter, paws sinking into soggy earth, nose twitching as he catches the scent of illness and warm broth drifting from the chimney.

With a calculated leap, the Wolf lands beneath the window, bracing himself and pushing against the glass until it cracks open.

Grandmother, hearing the sharp snap, limps toward the back room, her cane tapping against the worn floorboards.

The Wolf squeezes his massive frame through the gap, claws scraping against the wood, then lopes into the main room, blocking the doorway.

Grandmother grips her cane, brandishing it as she faces the intruder.

Grandmother stands tall despite her trembling hands, lifting her cane in warning as she plants her feet firmly between the Wolf and the door. "Stay back now, you beast! I may be old, but I've lived through worse than the likes of you. One step closer and you'll feel the sting of this cane!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf edges a paw forward, lips curling back to reveal sharp teeth in what could almost be mistaken for a smile. "Oh, dear lady, there's no need for threats—I only wish to keep you company on this lonely afternoon." ——The Wolf

Grandmother widens her stance, raising her cane higher, her knuckles white with tension. "Company from the likes of you is the last thing I need—I've seen that glint in your eye before, and it never led to anything good." ——Grandmother

The Wolf steps forward, its lips curling into a sly, unsettling smile as its shadow stretches across the floor. "Why such suspicion, grandmother—perhaps if you lowered that cane, you'd see I mean no harm at all." ——The Wolf

Grandmother narrows her eyes, tightening her grip on the cane and edging closer to the fireplace, searching for something else to defend herself with. "If you meant no harm, you'd have knocked at my door like any decent soul, not slinked in on silent paws." ——Grandmother

The Wolf circles slowly, lips curling in a thin, predatory smile, eyes never leaving the trembling cane. "Decency is for sheep, dear grandmother—wolves must enter as hunger commands." ——The Wolf

Grandmother narrows her eyes, tightening her grip on the cane, her knuckles white as she braces herself between the Wolf and the doorway. "Hunger or not, you'll find I don't bow to wolves—and if you take one more step, you'll regret it." ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his teeth in a mocking smile, slowly advancing, muscles tensed for a spring. "Regret is for those who survive, grandmother; I suggest you drop that cane before your trembling hands betray you." ——The Wolf

Grandmother tightens her grip on the cane, planting her feet firmly as she glares at the Wolf, refusing to yield ground. "My hands may tremble, but my aim is true—and if it's regret you wish to taste, come any closer and I'll show you the strength that kept me alive this long!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his teeth in a grim smile, inching forward with muscles coiled and eyes locked on the cane. "Strength may have kept you alive, but courage won't fill an empty belly—and I'm hungrier than you can imagine." ——The Wolf

Grandmother tightens her grip on the cane and squares her shoulders, planting herself firmly between the Wolf and the door. "Then you'll have to earn your supper, beast—because I won't let you take it from me while there's breath in my body!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his teeth but first engages Grandmother in a tense verbal exchange, using manipulation and psychological intimidation rather than immediate violence.

Grandmother resists, showing both courage and vulnerability, attempting to bargain for her life by offering food and appealing to the Wolf's potential for mercy.

The Wolf rebuffs her, expressing his predatory intent and lack of compassion, but delays his attack, savoring Grandmother's fear and desperation.

Grandmother gasps, her breath shallow as the Wolf's heavy paw pins her shoulder. She reaches desperately for her cane, her eyes wide with terror, struggling to free herself from his crushing grip. "Please—have mercy! What do you want from me? Let me go, I beg you!" ——Grandmother

The Wolf leans in close, his hot breath grazing her cheek as his claws dig deeper into her shoulder. "Mercy is for the weak, old woman; tonight, I want more than your pleas—I want your silence." ——The Wolf

Grandmother's voice trembles as she tries to twist free, her eyes wide with terror, searching the Wolf's face for any hint of compassion. "No, please—I'll do anything, just spare me!" ——Grandmother

The WolfHe bares his teeth in a wicked grin, pressing down harder as Grandmother gasps, her struggles growing more desperate. "Your anything means nothing to me—I've waited too long to be denied now." ——The Wolf

The Wolf leans in close, his hot breath rasping against her cheek as his claws dig deeper into her shoulder. "You should have locked your door tighter, Grandmother—now it's far too late for bargains." ——The Wolf

As the pot of soup simmers and the fire pops in the hearth, the Wolf gradually overpowers Grandmother, dragging her toward the shadowed bedroom as she pleads for mercy.

Grandmother clings to the doorframe, her hands trembling as she stares at the Wolf, eyes wide with terror and disbelief. Her voice quivers, pleading as she tries to halt his advance. "Please, sir—what is it you want with me? I have nothing of value, only soup and old bones. If you're hungry, take what you need, but let me be. Why do you look at me so?" ——Grandmother

The Wolf bares his teeth in a crooked grin, tightening his grip as he hauls Grandmother closer to the darkened doorway. "Ah, but it's not hunger for soup that gnaws at my belly tonight, old mother—it's the taste of fear, and you season it so well." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches her apron with trembling hands, glancing desperately toward the bubbling pot as the Wolf's shadow looms over her. "Mercy, Wolf—there's no need for cruelty; I'll fetch you bread and broth, just spare an old woman her peace." ——Grandmother

The Wolf tightens his grip, dragging her deeper into the gloom, his eyes glinting as the firelight flickers across his snout. "Peace is a thin blanket against the winter, Grandmother—and tonight, I mean to wrap myself in something warmer." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clings to the doorframe, her fingers trembling as she tries to meet the Wolf's gaze. "Surely you have a mother too, Wolf; would she wish you to spill an old woman's blood for warmth?" ——Grandmother

The Wolf tightens his grip, dragging Grandmother closer to the darkness beyond the bedroom door, his eyes glinting with cruel anticipation. "My mother taught me the cold never pities the weak, Grandmother—so why should I?" ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches the edge of the bedstead, her voice trembling as the Wolf's shadow looms larger against the flickering firelight. "Because even the coldest night can be softened by kindness, if you let it—please, Wolf, remember what it is to be spared." ——Grandmother

The Wolf tightens his grip, dragging her closer to the darkness of the bedroom, his shadow swallowing hers on the rug. "Kindness is a luxury for those who sleep safe behind locked doors, Grandmother—and tonight, your door was left wanting." ——The Wolf

Grandmother's trembling hands clutch the edge of the bed as the Wolf's shadow looms larger, his claws tracing the curve of her shoulder. "You needn't do this—there's enough warmth here for us both, if only you'd sit and share the soup instead of taking what can never be given." ——Grandmother

Outside, Red's distant footsteps crunch along the path, nearing the clearing as a raven flaps overhead and the forest hushes.

----------------------------------------

Inside the dim cabin, the wolf settles into his stolen disguise, every movement rehearsed in anticipation. As the last echoes of Grandmother’s plea fade, the hush outside grows tense, broken only by the approaching rhythm of Red's footsteps. The forest seems to hold its breath, and danger coils within the walls, ready to spring. With each step Red takes toward the door, the stage is set for a desperate struggle—one where survival hangs in a fragile balance, and rescue may come at a terrible cost.

# Chapter 7: Fight for Survival and Rescue

Red crouched near the hearth, clutching a heavy iron poker, her knuckles white.

Grandmother, pale but resolute, edged toward the locked pantry, dragging a battered stool behind her.

The Wolf, his fur slick and bristling from the storm, prowled at the threshold, claws scraping wood and nose twitching as he sniffed the air for weakness.

Red darted forward, thrusting the poker between herself and the beast, shouting, 'Stay back!

Red grips the poker tightly, her hands trembling despite her bold stance, eyes wide with fear but refusing to back down. "I mean it—don't you dare come any closer! I won't let you hurt me!" ——Red

' Grandmother flung open the pantry door, tossing a jar of pepper toward Red.

The Wolf lunged, jaws snapping;

Red swung the poker, striking his snout and scattering hot embers from the fire.

The Wolf recoiled, yelping, momentarily blinded by the smoke and pepper.

Grandmother seized the moment, throwing a heavy quilt over his head, tangling his limbs.

Red pushed her advantage, driving the Wolf toward the open door as thunder shook the cabin.

The Wolf, snarling, tore free and fled into the storm, leaving muddy prints and the acrid smell of singed fur behind.

Red slammed the door and bolted it, panting.

Grandmother collapsed onto the stool, Red rushed to her side, pouring water from a chipped mug.

The Wolf's retreat bought them time and safety, for now.

As the storm faded and dawn crept across the sky, Red and Grandmother sat together by the quiet hearth, safe at last, knowing that courage—and love—had carried them through the night.
