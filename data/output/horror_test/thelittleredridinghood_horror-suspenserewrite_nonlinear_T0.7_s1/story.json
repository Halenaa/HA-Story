The air is thick with the scent of damp leaves and distant smoke; the wind rustles through pine needles, and the ground squelches under Red's boots. Faint birdsong comes from deeper in the trees, but closer to the cabin, silence hangs heavily.",

She pauses to listen, noting the absence of her grandmother's usual humming and the strange creak of the front door swinging slightly ajar. Driven by her responsibility to deliver medicine, Red approaches and knocks lightly, her knuckles brushing against rough wood. From inside, a voice—unusually deep and raspy—calls out for her to enter, claiming to be her grandmother. Red hesitates, peering through the half-open door, and notices thick, coarse fur tangled around the doorknob and muddy footprints trailing toward the bed. Determined to help, Red steps into the cabin, setting the basket on the table as she glances warily toward the shadowed figure beneath the quilt. The wolf, hidden in the bed and motivated by hunger and deception, mimics the grandmother's speech, urging Red to come closer to 'see her better.' Red moves slowly, her eyes flicking between the unfamiliar shape beneath the covers and the remnants of a broken teacup on the floor, piecing together the oddities as she inches forward.",

The sun filters weakly through the small, grimy windows, casting elongated shadows across the creaking floorboards. The air is thick with the scent of damp wood and stale linen. Outside, a faint wind rattles the loose shutters. Red stands at the threshold, basket in hand, her boots leaving muddy prints on the worn rug.",

She edges closer to the bed, where a figure lies beneath a heap of blankets—features oddly concealed by a bonnet pulled too low. The figure, voice rough but attempting sweetness, croaks, 'Come closer, child.' Red hesitates, clutching her basket tighter, her nose wrinkling at a faint, musky animal odor beneath the usual herbal scent. She scans the room, noting the overturned mug and the claw marks gouged faintly into the bedpost. The Wolf, disguised and motivated by hunger, curls its lips beneath the covers and beckons her with a trembling, overly large hand. Red, recalling her mother’s warnings, inches forward but stops just out of reach, her gaze fixed on the glint of sharp teeth barely masked by the creature’s forced smile. The Wolf, growing impatient, pats the mattress beside it, voice dropping lower as it presses, 'Sit by me, dear, so I may see you better.' Red, mind racing, sets her basket deliberately on the far table, stalling for time as she searches for anything that might serve as a weapon. The tension sharpens with each exchanged word, Red’s suspicions mounting with every unnatural gesture the Wolf makes.",

She paused, glancing over her shoulder after a sudden rustle in the undergrowth. Ahead, the path curved around a fallen log blanketed in velvety green moss. As she rounded the bend, a large gray wolf emerged from the shadows between two trees, blocking her way. The wolf’s yellow eyes fixed on her, his ears pricked forward. He tilted his head, sniffed the air, and spoke in a low, articulate voice: 'Good morning, little traveler. Where might you be going on such a fine day?' Red gripped the basket tighter, recalling her mother’s warnings, and stepped back, answering warily, 'Just visiting my grandmother to bring her medicine.' The wolf padded closer, his paws silent on the soft earth, circling to block her retreat. He flicked his tail, feigning casual curiosity, and asked, 'And where does your grandmother live? Is it far from here?' Red hesitated, eyeing the wolf’s bared teeth and the twitch of his muscles beneath his fur. She shifted her weight, ready to run if needed, while searching for a believable but vague reply. The wolf, sensing her caution, narrowed his eyes, his nostrils flaring as he considered his next move, determined to extract the information he needed to hunt more effectively. The encounter left Red forced to choose her words with care, and the wolf, unsatisfied, prowled in a slow circle, plotting his next question.",

Red's mother points toward the woods visible through the open door, voice low and stern as she instructs Red on the safest path and warns her not to stray. Red nods, glancing from her mother’s serious face to the shadowy tree line, then tightens the cloak around her shoulders, gripping the basket handle with determination. As she steps toward the doorway, her mother gently touches her arm, repeating her warnings about the wolf prowling the woods, making Red pause and memorize the instructions. Their exchange ends with Red promising to deliver the supplies quickly and safely, her mother watching her leave, arms crossed tightly in concern.",

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, pulling it tighter against a sudden chill as she listens to the rustle of undergrowth nearby. Motivated by her mother's warnings, Red quickens her pace, scanning the trees for movement. Suddenly, a large, gray wolf emerges from behind a cluster of ferns, blocking the path. The wolf lowers his head, lips curled in a sly smile, and addresses Red in a low, articulate voice, asking where she is headed. Red, remembering her mother's instructions, hesitates before answering, her hand inching protectively toward her basket. The wolf, motivated by hunger and cunning, circles Red slowly, sniffing the air between them and pressing her for details about her journey, his bushy tail flicking with calculated patience. The interaction ends with Red sidestepping the wolf’s path, determined to keep moving, while the wolf disappears into the trees, his eyes following her with predatory intent.",

She rises with effort, her hands trembling as she pulls her shawl tighter. Outside, the Wolf circles the cabin's perimeter, paws sinking into soggy earth, nose twitching as he catches the scent of illness and warm broth drifting from the chimney. With a calculated leap, the Wolf lands beneath the window, bracing himself and pushing against the glass until it cracks open. Grandmother, hearing the sharp snap, limps toward the back room, her cane tapping against the worn floorboards. The Wolf squeezes his massive frame through the gap, claws scraping against the wood, then lopes into the main room, blocking the doorway. Grandmother grips her cane, brandishing it as she faces the intruder. The Wolf bares his teeth, voice low and articulate: 'You needn't resist, old one. I'm only here for a taste.' He lunges, knocking the cane aside and pinning Grandmother to the floorboards, his heavy paw pressing her shoulder as she struggles beneath him. As a pot of soup simmers and the fire pops in the hearth, the Wolf drags Grandmother toward the shadowed bedroom, her shoes scraping against the braided rug. Outside, Red's distant footsteps crunch along the path, nearing the clearing as a raven flaps overhead and the forest hushes.",

The Wolf, his fur slick and bristling from the storm, prowled at the threshold, claws scraping wood and nose twitching as he sniffed the air for weakness. Red darted forward, thrusting the poker between herself and the beast, shouting, 'Stay back!' Grandmother flung open the pantry door, tossing a jar of pepper toward Red. The Wolf lunged, jaws snapping; Red swung the poker, striking his snout and scattering hot embers from the fire. The Wolf recoiled, yelping, momentarily blinded by the smoke and pepper. Grandmother seized the moment, throwing a heavy quilt over his head, tangling his limbs. Red pushed her advantage, driving the Wolf toward the open door as thunder shook the cabin. The Wolf, snarling, tore free and fled into the storm, leaving muddy prints and the acrid smell of singed fur behind. Red slammed the door and bolted it, panting. Grandmother collapsed onto the stool, Red rushed to her side, pouring water from a chipped mug. The Wolf's retreat bought them time and safety, for now.",
