From inside, a voice—unusually deep and raspy—calls out for her to enter, claiming to be her grandmother. Red hesitates, peering through the half-open door, and notices thick, coarse fur tangled around the doorknob and muddy footprints trailing toward the bed. Determined to help, Red steps into the cabin, setting the basket on the table as she glances warily toward the shadowed figure beneath the quilt. The wolf, hidden in the bed and motivated by hunger and deception, mimics the grandmother's speech, urging Red to come closer to 'see her better.'

Instead of simply hesitating and stalling for time, Red actively interrogates the disguised Wolf, noting not just physical oddities but also strange odors, gestures, and behaviors. She voices her doubts repeatedly, referencing her mother's warnings and clearly suspects that the figure before her may not be her grandmother. As the Wolf grows more insistent and revealing in its responses, Red shifts from passive caution to active strategizing, scanning for makeshift weapons and formulating a plan to defend herself. The Wolf, feeling its deception slip, becomes alternately defensive and aggressive, attempting to maintain its disguise while letting more predatory intent show through.

His yellow eyes fixed on her, and he spoke in a low, articulate voice: 'You’re wary, and with good reason. But tell me—what trails do the hunters favor at dawn? I’ve smelled their iron on the wind, and I won’t be caught unawares. Speak plainly, or I’ll find my answers elsewhere, and you won’t like how I ask.' Red, clutching her basket tighter and recalling her mother’s warnings, tried to distract the wolf, speaking evasively: 'If you're looking for something, perhaps you should ask directly. I have little to give, and less to say that would interest a traveler such as yourself.' The wolf, feigning curiosity but hiding predatory intent, pressed further about her destination and what she carried, probing with increasingly pointed questions. Red remained resourceful, offering cryptic answers and hinting at danger while refusing to reveal her true errand or her grandmother’s location.
