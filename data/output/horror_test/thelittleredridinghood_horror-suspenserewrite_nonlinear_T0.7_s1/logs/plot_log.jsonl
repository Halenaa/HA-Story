Driven by her responsibility to deliver medicine, Red approaches and knocks lightly, her knuckles brushing against rough wood. From inside, a voice—unusually deep and raspy—calls out for her to enter, claiming to be her grandmother. Red hesitates, peering through the half-open door, and notices thick, coarse fur tangled around the doorknob and muddy footprints trailing toward the bed.

The wolf, hidden in the bed and motivated by hunger and deception, mimics the grandmother's speech, urging Red to come closer to 'see her better.'

He tilted his head, sniffed the air, and spoke in a low, articulate voice: 'Good morning, little traveler. Where might you be going on such a fine day?' Red gripped the basket tighter, recalling her mother’s warnings, and stepped back, answering warily, 'Just visiting my grandmother to bring her medicine.' The wolf padded closer, his paws silent on the soft earth, circling to block her retreat. He flicked his tail, feigning casual curiosity, and asked, 'And where does your grandmother live? Is it far from here?' Red hesitated, eyeing the wolf’s bared teeth and the twitch of his muscles beneath his fur. She shifted her weight, ready to run if needed, while searching for a believable but vague reply. The wolf, sensing her caution, narrowed his eyes, his nostrils flaring as he considered his next move, determined to extract the information he needed to hunt more effectively. The encounter left Red forced to choose her words with care, and the wolf, unsatisfied, prowled in a slow circle, plotting his next question."}}
