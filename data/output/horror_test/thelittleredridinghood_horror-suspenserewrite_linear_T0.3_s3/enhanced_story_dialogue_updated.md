# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Warning and a Mission

As Red prepares to leave, her mother packs the basket with care, warning her daughter about the dangers lurking in the forest—especially the wolf, who has recently become more brazen.

Unbeknownst to them, deep in the forest, the Wolf prowls restlessly, vowing that from this night forward, all the creatures of the woods will fear his presence.

Red, determined to prove her independence, reassures her mother that she knows the way and promises to be careful, eager to reach her grandmother before midday.

----------------------------------------

As Red steps beyond the safety of her home and into the shadowed edge of the forest, the weight of her mother's warning lingers in her mind, even as determination pushes her forward. With every crunch of fallen leaves beneath her boots, the path grows more uncertain, and the hush of the ancient woods presses close around her. It is here, in the heart of the wilderness, that her journey takes an unexpected turn—one that brings her face to face with someone who might change the course of her fate.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Huntsman

Red, clutching her wicker basket and adjusting her red cloak against the damp chill, hesitates at the tree line, scanning the tangled undergrowth for movement.

She steps forward, boots sinking slightly into the muddy path, determined to reach her grandmother's cottage before noon.

Suddenly, a twig snaps—The Huntsman strides from behind a spruce, his axe slung over one shoulder and a wary glance sweeping the woods.

He raises a gloved hand to halt Red, his brow furrowed.

'You shouldn't be in the forest alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and urgent.

Rather than simply mentioning wolves, he points out deep, high claw marks on a birch.

'See these marks?

Fresh.

The Huntsman traces the jagged gouges with a gloved finger, eyes scanning the shadowed thickets beyond the birch. The Huntsman crouched beside the birch, tracing the jagged gouges with a gloved finger. His vigilant gaze swept the thick shadows beyond, weighing every whisper of movement. "These marks are fresh," he murmured, voice lowered to a wary hush as he gestured for the others to look closer. "Too deep for wolf, too high for bear." His brow furrowed; years of experience in these woods lent gravity to his words. Something else prowled beneath the tangled canopy tonight—something clever enough to watch from the darkness, but strong enough that it didn’t fear them. Straightening, he cast a steady look toward the edge of the thicket. "We’d best keep our wits about us," he warned, every muscle poised and ready for whatever might emerge from the gloom.
Too deep for wolf, too high for bear.

The HuntsmanHe steps forward, voice hushed but urgent, gesturing toward the shadowed woodland path as he scans the treeline for movement. The Huntsman stepped forward, his boots barely making a sound on the mossy earth. His voice, low and urgent, cut through the morning hush as he gestured toward the shadowed woodland path, eyes never resting as they searched the treeline for any sign of movement. “Miss, wait—don’t venture further alone.” There was a tension in his posture, shoulders squared, hand resting near the worn handle of his axe. “At first light, I found tracks—fresh, too fresh for comfort.” The memory flickered across his face, years of experience sharpening his vigilance. “The forest’s edge is no longer safe, not with footsteps I can’t name.” He took another cautious step closer, his resolve clear. “Let me escort you; whatever left those marks may still be near.”
Something else prowls these woods tonight—something clever enough to watch, but strong enough not to fear us.

' He leans in, lowering his voice, and adds, 'At first light, I found tracks—fresh, too fresh for comfort.

The forest's edge is no longer safe, not with footsteps I can't name.

Let me escort you;

whatever left those marks may still be near.

' Red glances toward the sun-dappled path, her resolve flickering but not extinguished.

'My grandmother needs me.

I can handle myself,' she insists, but the Huntsman's urgency gives her pause.

Driven by her desire to prove her independence, she reluctantly agrees, and together they advance along the winding trail, boots crunching through last year's leaves and eyes alert for danger.

----------------------------------------

Yet as they pressed deeper into the silent forest, shadows lengthened and the sense of unease grew. Though the Huntsman’s presence offered some reassurance, Red couldn’t shake the feeling that something—or someone—was watching. The woods, alive with secrets, seemed to shift around them, setting the stage for the dangers that lay ahead and the cunning adversary waiting just beyond their sight.

# Chapter 3: Wolf’s Deception in the Woods

Red adjusts her red cloak as she navigates around a muddy puddle, clutching a wicker basket filled with bread and herbs.

She pauses, scanning the undergrowth for movement, when The Wolf emerges from behind a twisted oak, his fur bristling and nose twitching as he sniffs the air.

The Wolf steps onto the path, blocking Red's way.

He tilts his head and asks, 'Where are you going on such a lonely trail, little girl?

' Red hesitates, then replies, 'I'm bringing food and medicine to my grandmother.

' The Wolf narrows his eyes, studying Red for signs of fear, and replies, 'Such a good granddaughter.

Is her house far from here?

' As Red points deeper into the woods, The Wolf’s tail flicks, and he circles her, scanning the path for shortcuts.

Red watches him warily, her grip tightening on the basket, while The Wolf, masking his hunger, plots a quicker route to Grandmother’s cottage.

The encounter ends with Red hurrying down the path, glancing back, while The Wolf melts into the undergrowth, paws silent on the damp earth, intent on reaching the cottage first.

----------------------------------------

As Red disappears into the winding trail, the forest grows quiet, save for the faint rustle of leaves where the wolf slipped away. Shadows deepen as he moves swiftly and unseen, following the shortcut he devised. While Red keeps to the familiar path, unaware of what lies ahead, the wolf’s determination leads him ever closer to his goal. The peaceful cottage just beyond the trees is about to receive an unexpected visitor.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House

The Wolf, having traced Red’s scent to the cottage, approaches with a cunning plan: to deceive Grandmother by mimicking Red's voice.

He scratches at the door and speaks, imitating Red, but Grandmother, more cautious and perceptive than expected, questions him repeatedly—testing his hands, eyes, and memories.

As suspicions grow, Grandmother demands proof by asking for a secret song only Red and she would know.

Unable to answer, the Wolf grows impatient and drops his pretense, revealing his hunger and true intent.

The Wolf scratches softly at the old wooden door, pressing his muzzle close to the crack, straining to shape his voice into the high, gentle tones of Red Riding Hood. With a practiced, delicate scratch at the old wooden door, the Wolf pressed his muzzle close to the weathered crack, every muscle coiled with calculated patience. He drew in a slow breath, shaping his voice into the soft, high lilt of the girl he had so carefully studied. 

"Grandmother, it's me—Red Riding Hood," he called sweetly, letting the words slip through the narrow gap like a tendril of smoke. "I've brought you some bread and butter from Mother. Please, may I come in?" 

Every syllable dripped with feigned innocence, the Wolf’s voice barely trembling with the effort of mimicry, his ears pricked for any sound from within.
Grandmother pauses by the door, pressing her ear to the wood, uncertainty flickering in her eyes. Grandmother hesitated at the threshold, her thin hand hovering over the latch. She pressed her ear gently against the old wooden door, uncertainty flitting across her tired eyes as the voice outside pleaded for entry. Something in the tone unsettled her—a roughness, perhaps, or a note she could not place. Concern knitting her brow, she called out softly through the wood, asking if her dear grandchild was feeling unwell, for the voice sounded strangely different today.
The Wolf presses closer to the door, paw resting against the wood, voice softening to sound more childlike. The Wolf pressed closer to the weathered door, letting his paw rest lightly against the splintered wood. With a practiced flick of his tongue, he softened his voice, pitching it to mimic the gentle lilt of a child. "Oh, it's just a little cold, Grandmother, but I promise I'm quite alright—please, do let me in before I catch a chill." As he spoke, his claws scratched softly at the threshold, every syllable a calculated plea, every note designed to disarm suspicion and lure his prey closer.
Grandmother shuffles over to her bed, glancing anxiously toward the door as she waits for 'Red' to enter. With a trembling hand, Grandmother eased herself onto the edge of her bed, the familiar ache in her bones flaring as she settled against the worn pillows. Her gaze flickered anxiously toward the door at the sound of scratching, heart fluttering at the voice that called out—so like her dear Red’s, yet edged with something she couldn’t quite name. Still, she forced a gentle steadiness into her words, drawing on a lifetime of kindness. “Well, if you’re sure it’s only a cold, come in, child,” she called, voice wavering but warm. She glanced at the latch, remembering she’d already left it lifted for her granddaughter, a small gesture of trust and love.
Grandmother, terrified, calls for help and tries to resist, but the Wolf corners her, making his predatory intentions explicit.

The Wolf stands outside the door, voice unusually sweet, paws tucked behind his back to hide his claws, eyes glinting hungrily through the dim light. Outside the door, the Wolf lingered, his voice slipping through the wood with a syrupy sweetness that belied the hunger gleaming in his eyes. He tucked his paws discreetly behind his back, careful to hide the sharp curve of his claws, and leaned closer to the dim-lit threshold. “Good evening, Grandmother,” he called, each syllable weighed with gentle warmth. “I’ve brought your supper, just the way you like it—warm and hearty.” His tone was patient, coaxing, as he pressed, “May I come in?” The wolf’s eyes never left the shadows inside, anticipation flickering within their cold depths as he waited for the latch to lift.
Grandmother hesitates by the door, clutching her shawl tightly and peering through the dim light. Grandmother lingered at the threshold, her thin fingers knotting more tightly around the faded shawl draped over her shoulders. The dim glow from the lamp barely reached the corners of the room, casting long, uncertain shadows. She squinted into the dusk, searching the familiar outline of her grandchild, yet something in the voice—soft, yet oddly distant—made her heart flutter with unease. With a tremulous breath, she asked, her words gentle but edged with concern, “Why, child, your voice sounds rather strange tonight—are you sure it’s really you?”
The Wolf presses a bundled basket forward, paw trembling slightly as he steps closer to the door, eyes fixed on Grandmother. The Wolf pressed the bundled basket forward, his paw trembling ever so slightly as he stepped closer to the door, eyes never leaving Grandmother’s wary face. He offered a thin, reassuring smile, the edges of his muzzle twitching as if chilled. “It’s just a touch of the chill from the woods, Grandmother—nothing to worry about,” he murmured, voice smooth and almost soothing. With a practiced flourish, he lifted the lid to let the savory aroma waft through the doorway. “I promise your favorite stew is piping hot.”
Grandmother sits up in bed, clutching her blanket a little tighter, peering anxiously toward the door. Grandmother stirred beneath her patchwork quilt, propping herself up with a trembling hand as the aroma of stew drifted into the dim room. She clutched the blanket a little tighter, eyes sharp with a flicker of worry as they fixed on the doorway. “Stew, you say?” Her voice, though frail, carried a note of gentle authority. She leaned forward, peering toward the golden pool of candlelight that quivered on the nightstand. “Let me see your hands—hold them up to the candlelight, dear, so I can be sure it’s you.”
The Wolf slowly extends his clawed paws into the flickering candlelight, trying to keep them partially hidden beneath the folds of a borrowed shawl. The Wolf, shrouded in the moth-eaten folds of Grandmother’s shawl, let his clawed paws slip forward into the uncertain halo cast by the bedside candle. He moved slowly, careful to keep most of the wicked talons hidden beneath the faded wool, but allowed just enough of their shadow to flicker on the quilt. With a voice pitched to a gentle, wavering imitation, he murmured, "Of course, Grandmother—see, here they are, though the shadows from the candle make them look larger than usual, don't they?"
Grandmother clutches the blanket tighter around her shoulders, her eyes narrowing as she leans closer to inspect the Wolf's hands. Grandmother clutched the blanket more tightly around her frail shoulders, the fabric bunched in her twisted fingers as she peered closer through the dim light. Her eyes, still sharp despite their age, narrowed as she took in the sight before her. She hesitated, her voice gentle but edged with a quiet wisdom born of years and solitude. “My, but your hands do look so rough and strong tonight—almost like a hunter’s, not my sweet grandchild’s.” The observation lingered in the air, her gaze fixed on the hands resting atop the coverlet, searching for familiarity and finding instead a troubling strangeness.
The Wolf steps closer to the bed, keeping his hands just at the edge of the candlelight, his eyes glinting in the shadow. The Wolf stepped closer to the bed, careful to keep his hands just at the edge of the candlelight, his eyes glinting in the shadow as he spoke in a voice both plaintive and coaxing. “Oh, Grandmother, it’s only from carrying your heavy supper basket through the brambles…” He let his words trail off, gaze lingering on the old woman’s wary face, before adding with a soft, almost wounded lilt, “Surely you wouldn’t turn me away when I’m so hungry for your company?”
Grandmother tightens her grip on her shawl, peering intently at the figure silhouetted in the doorway. Grandmother’s fingers tightened around the edge of her shawl, knuckles pale as she squinted into the gloom beyond the doorway. Her voice, though gentle, carried the steady wisdom of a lifetime as she called out, “Step closer, then, but mind you keep to the light—my eyes are not what they were, and I must be certain before I share my table.” She leaned forward, frail shoulders drawn in, determined not to let caution slip, even as the scent of supper drifted in with the cool evening air.
The Wolf edges closer, placing the basket in the pool of candlelight, his shadow looming large on the wall behind him. The Wolf edged closer, the basket cradled in his paws as he stepped into the warm pool of candlelight. His shadow stretched, warped and towering against the cottage wall, swallowing the gentle flicker of flame. With a voice sweetened by false concern, he murmured, “Of course, Grandmother—let me set the basket down where you can see every morsel, and perhaps you'll see it's truly me after all.” He placed the basket with deliberate care, eyes never leaving the old woman’s anxious face, his words weaving reassurance from the very fabric of her doubt.
Grandmother leans forward, squinting into the dim candlelight, her hands trembling just above the table. Grandmother leaned forward, her frail hands hovering just above the table as she squinted into the dim candlelight. The shadows flickered across her lined face, making her appear both vulnerable and wise. "Very well," she murmured, her voice thin but resolute. She beckoned me closer, insisting gently, "Let me look into your eyes, for they always told me the truth when your voice could not." As I stepped nearer, I saw the resilience beneath her trembling fingers, the quiet strength that had weathered so many seasons alone on the edge of the forest.
The Wolf leans forward, his gaze fixed intently on Grandmother, casting an elongated shadow across the room. The Wolf leaned forward, his hulking form casting an elongated shadow that stretched across the humble room. His eyes, sharp and unblinking, fixed intently on Grandmother as if he could drink in every flicker of her fear. With a sly tilt of his head, he let his gaze linger on the hearth’s glow. "Why, Grandmother, my eyes may seem brighter tonight—it's only the reflection of your warm fire, drawing me ever closer," he murmured, the words curling from his lips like smoke, smooth and reassuring, masking the hunger that lingered just beneath.
Grandmother leans forward, narrowing her gaze, her trembling hand clutching the edge of the candlelit table. Grandmother leaned forward across the candlelit table, her frail body casting long shadows on the worn wood. With a trembling hand, she clutched the edge, steadying herself as she peered at me—her gaze narrowed, searching. “Your eyes glisten so strangely, child,” she murmured, voice soft yet edged with wisdom, “almost as if they hunger for something more than supper.” The words lingered between us, gentle and perceptive, as the golden light flickered over her lined face.
The Wolf leans forward, letting the firelight catch his eyes as he places the basket with deliberate care upon the table. With a sinuous grace, the Wolf leaned forward, letting the flickering firelight glimmer in his watchful eyes. He set the basket on the table with careful deliberation, as though every movement were a calculated part of his performance. “Why, Grandmother,” he murmured, his voice smooth as velvet, “perhaps it’s simply the excitement of seeing you again after so long—my appetite is keen, but only for your company.” The words slid from his tongue with practiced ease, sweet and disarming, masking the razor’s edge beneath his smile.
Grandmother sits forward in her chair, clutching her shawl tightly and watching the Wolf with wary eyes. Grandmother sat forward in her chair, the thin shawl trembling in her grasp as she drew it tighter around her frail shoulders. Illness had left her voice softer, but her eyes—still bright with wisdom—never wavered from the Wolf's looming figure by the hearth. Wariness flickered across her face as she watched him, searching for reassurance. “Then let the firelight fall full upon your face, dear,” she said gently, her gaze not leaving his, “for shadows can hide much that the heart ought to see.”
The Wolf leans in, letting the flickering firelight illuminate his face, a sly smile curling at the edge of his mouth. The Wolf leaned in, allowing the flickering firelight to dance across his sharp features, the sly smile at the edge of his mouth deepening as he spoke. “Certainly, Grandmother—come closer and see for yourself,” he purred, his voice smooth and inviting, every feature laid bare in the glow. He tilted his head just so, feigning warmth and patience, his eyes glinting with concealed intent as he beckoned her nearer, drawing her in with the promise of familiarity.
Grandmother hesitates at the edge of the hearth, clutching her shawl and peering anxiously into the wolf's gleaming eyes. Grandmother lingered at the edge of the hearth, her frail fingers gathering her shawl more tightly around her shoulders. The flicker of firelight danced across the stranger’s face—so like, and yet so unlike, the one she longed for. Her voice quavered, edged with both fear and wisdom earned over long years. “I shall,” she whispered, though her heart fluttered in her chest, “but my heart trembles, for your face in the firelight is not the one I remember—who are you truly?” Her eyes, clouded yet keen, searched the wolf’s gleaming gaze for any sign of the familiar.
The Wolf steps forward, casting a looming shadow across the hearth as Grandmother grips the edge of her chair, her knuckles white. The Wolf stepped forward, his shadow stretching long and sinister across the flickering hearth. Grandmother clung to the edge of her chair, her knuckles blanched with fear. He tilted his head, voice silken but edged with menace as he regarded her trembling form. "Why, Grandmother, isn't it enough that I've brought you supper and warmth—must you question who stands before you?" The words unfurled in the smoky air, a gentle chiding laced with something colder, as the Wolf’s gaze lingered on her paling face.
Grandmother clutches her shawl tighter, her eyes narrowing as she leans forward, searching the Wolf's face for any sign of familiarity. Grandmother’s thin fingers tightened around her shawl, pulling it close as if to shield herself from more than just the evening chill. Her breath came shallow, but her gaze was sharp, unwavering, as she searched the Wolf’s unfamiliar features for any shadow of the child she knew. Leaning forward with quiet determination, she said softly, her voice trembling with both frailty and resolve, “If you are truly my grandchild, then tell me—what song did I sing you each night before supper, for only you and I would know its tune?”
The Wolf leans forward, eyes glinting in the firelight, hands tense on the basket as Grandmother draws back, her suspicion deepening. The Wolf leaned forward, his sharp eyes catching the firelight in a predatory glint, hands tightening imperceptibly around the basket’s woven handle. Sensing Grandmother’s suspicion deepen by the flicker in her gaze and the way she shrank further into her shawl, he offered a gentle, almost apologetic smile. “Ah, Grandmother,” he murmured, voice smooth as velvet, “the tune escapes me tonight—perhaps if you hum the first few notes, my memory will return.” His words, wrapped in false warmth, floated between them, coaxing her trust even as he watched every nervous movement with patient calculation.
Grandmother clutches her shawl tighter, edging toward the hearth poker, her fearful gaze fixed on the figure before her. Grandmother clutched her shawl tighter about her thin shoulders, the tremor in her gnarled hands betraying both her fear and her resolve. Inch by inch, she edged toward the hearth poker, her wary eyes never leaving the shadowed figure in her doorway. Her voice, though frail, rang with a quiet authority as she said, "If you cannot recall the song that soothed you to sleep, then you are not the one I wait for—leave my door, or I shall call for help."
The scene ends with Grandmother desperately pleading for mercy while the Wolf makes clear he means to attack her, heightening the threat and urgency compared to the original plan of simply cornering her.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the crunch of footsteps draws nearer, signaling Red’s arrival just as the house falls silent once more. Within, the wolf hastily completes his disguise, settling into Grandmother’s bed and steadying his breath, determined to play his part. Unaware of the danger awaiting her, Red approaches the familiar door, her basket in hand, ready to greet the one she believes is her beloved grandmother.

# Chapter 5: Red Faces the Imposter

Red enters the cottage with her basket, immediately sensing something is amiss due to the unfamiliar musk lingering beneath the usual scent of lavender.

The Wolf, disguised as Grandmother, beckons her closer with an imitation of Grandmother's voice.

As Red approaches, she becomes increasingly suspicious, scrutinizing the coarse fur, sharp nails, and pointed teeth hidden only partially by the covers.

The Wolf, swathed in Grandmother's nightcap and shawl, props himself up with a trembling hand, his sharp gaze fixed on Red. He pats the space on the bed invitingly, his voice low and gravelly as he gestures for her to approach. Swathed in Grandmother’s nightcap and shawl, the Wolf propped himself up with a trembling hand, his claws just barely concealed beneath the faded linen. His sharp, predatory gaze fixed unblinking on Red as he patted the space beside him, the gesture inviting yet laced with something unspoken. His voice curled into the hush of the room, low and gravelly, as he coaxed, “Come closer, my dear. It has been so long since I’ve seen you. These old eyes can barely make out your sweet face.”
Red steps hesitantly toward the bed, her gaze lingering on the Wolf's unnaturally large eyes, a note of uncertainty creeping into her voice. Red hesitated at the threshold, her fingers tightening around the edge of her crimson cloak as she took in the dimly lit room. The figure in the bed—her grandmother, or so she desperately hoped—lay swathed in nightcap and shawl, but something was amiss. Red’s gaze lingered on those eyes, impossibly wide and gleaming in the shadowed light. A tremor of uncertainty threaded through her voice as she stepped closer, unable to keep her thoughts from spilling out: “Grandmother, what big eyes you have!”
The Wolf smiles thinly, his sharp teeth barely concealed as he pats the quilted blanket, urging Red to step nearer. The Wolf reclined deeper into the worn mattress, the nightcap drooping over the glint of his cunning eyes. With a thin, almost affectionate smile that did little to hide the sharpness lurking beneath, he patted the edge of the quilted blanket, coaxing Red a step closer. His head turned just enough for her to glimpse the hunger in his gaze, and his voice slithered out, deceptively gentle: “The better to see you with, my child.”
Red edges nearer, her brow furrowing as she studies the Wolf's oversized, furry ears poking out from beneath the nightcap. Red edged closer, her heart thudding as she peered at the figure nestled beneath the patchwork quilt. Something was wrong—she could feel it prickling beneath her skin. Her gaze lingered on the strange, oversized ears poking out from beneath Grandmother’s familiar nightcap, tufted and twitching in a way she didn’t remember. Brow furrowed, Red’s voice trembled with uncertainty as she murmured, “Grandmother, what big ears you have!”
The Wolf's furry ears twitch atop the nightcap as he strains forward, voice gravelly yet coaxing, eyes glinting with hunger. The Wolf’s furry ears poked through the frayed edges of Grandmother’s nightcap, twitching with anticipation as he strained forward on the creaking bed. His voice, gravelly yet coaxing, slipped from his throat—a carefully calculated growl masked in affection. Those glinting eyes, bright with hunger and cunning, never left Little Red Riding Hood as he murmured, “The better to hear you with, my dear,” lacing each word with predatory patience, inviting her closer with the promise of comfort.
Red steps nearer, her voice trembling as she gazes at the sharp, glinting teeth peeking from beneath the shawl. Red’s feet barely made a sound across the worn floorboards as she crept closer to the bed, her heart pounding against the cage of her ribs. The flickering lamplight caught on the jagged edges of the teeth protruding from beneath her grandmother’s familiar shawl, and Red swallowed hard, forcing herself to stand firm. Compassion warred with a rising tide of unease as she studied the strange, predatory grin. Her voice shook, more with worry than fear, when she managed to ask, “Grandmother, what big teeth you have…”
The Wolf bares his sharp teeth in a sinister grin, lunging forward as Red gasps and stumbles backward in terror. The Wolf’s lips curled into a sinister grin, sharp teeth glinting beneath the drooping edge of Grandmother’s borrowed nightcap. As Red gasped, stumbling backward, he lunged from the tangled sheets with predatory grace. His voice, low and silkily dangerous, cut through the air—“The better to eat you with, my dear”—each word dripping with cruel intent as he closed the distance between them, the deception finally shed and his hunger revealed.
The conversation becomes more tense and elaborate than before, with Red repeatedly questioning the Wolf about his physical features—eyes, ears, hands, nails, breath, and the scent—each time receiving increasingly evasive or predatory answers.

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, the coarse fur bristling at the edge of the sheet, one clawed hand emerging just far enough to gesture invitingly. His gaze remains fixed on Red, lips curled in what might pass for a smile, though too many sharp teeth glint in the shadow. The Wolf shifted beneath the covers, coarse fur bristling at the edge of the sheet. One clawed hand emerged just far enough to gesture invitingly, the movement slow and deliberate. His gaze never left Red, predatory eyes gleaming as his lips curled into a semblance of a smile, though too many sharp teeth glinted in the shadow to be reassuring.  

"You hesitate, dear child," he observed softly, his voice taking on a cracked, aged timbre meant to mimic frailty. "Are you frightened of your old grandmother’s voice?" The words slithered through the dim room as he tilted his head, feigning concern. His hand beckoned her closer, the claws barely concealed. "Come closer," he urged, letting the request linger between them. "Let me touch that beautiful red cloak of yours—I’ve never seen its color shine so bright in this dim room."  

Red set her basket down, eyes narrowing as she studied the figure’s coarse fur peeking from beneath the sheets. The Wolf’s invitation hung in the air, equal parts coaxing and command, a patient predator’s snare woven with words and gestures.
Red edges forward, clutching her basket tightly, her gaze flickering uneasily to the Wolf’s clawed fingers gripping the sheet. Red edged forward, her fingers curling tightly around the worn handle of her basket. Wariness flickered in her gaze as she studied the figure on the bed, noting how coarse fur peeked out from beneath the quilt. Her eyes narrowed, settling on the Wolf’s clawed hands—so much larger than she remembered. Red hesitated, her voice soft but edged with suspicion as she set the basket down and ventured, “Grandmother, your hands—why do they look so large under the quilt? Have you been working in the garden again?”
The Wolf stretches a clawed hand from beneath the covers, the coarse fur bristling in the candlelight as Red hesitates, gripping her basket tighter. The Wolf shifted beneath the patchwork quilt, letting one clawed, fur-bristled hand emerge into the flickering candlelight. Red paused, her knuckles whitening around the woven handle of her basket as her gaze flickered between the grotesquely gnarled fingers and the shadowed face on the pillow. The Wolf’s voice oozed from the darkness, smooth and unhurried. “Yes, my dear,” he crooned, each word carefully measured, “digging and pulling weeds all spring has made them strong.” The hand beckoned, patient and inviting. “Come, let me hold your hand and feel how you’ve grown.”
Red steps back, her grip tightening on the basket as she peers closer, unease flickering across her face. Red took an uneasy step back, her grip tightening around the basket's worn handle. She set it down with deliberate care, her gaze drawn irresistibly to the figure before her. As she inched closer, a flicker of doubt crossed her face, sharpening the lines of determination in her brow. Her eyes narrowed, tracing the coarse fur and then lingering on those impossibly long, pointed nails—so unlike the gentle hands she remembered, the ones that used to braid her hair with such tenderness. The words slipped out, quiet but edged with suspicion: "But your nails—so long and sharp—they look nothing like the gentle hands that used to braid my hair."
The Wolf slowly lifts a clawed hand from beneath the quilt, its shadow stretching across the bed as Red instinctively steps back, clutching her cloak tighter. The Wolf shifted beneath the heavy quilt, a slow, deliberate movement that sent a ripple through the coarse fur sprouting from its wrists. From under the covers, a clawed hand emerged, its shadow stretching long and ominous across the rumpled bed. Red felt her heart stutter, her fingers tightening around the familiar red cloak as she inched backward.

With a voice that slithered through the dim light, the Wolf beckoned her closer. "Ah, child, age makes everything grow wild—come closer, let me stroke your hair as I used to." The words, thick with feigned affection, curled through the room like smoke, masking the hunger gleaming in those lupine eyes.
Red takes a hesitant step back, clutching her cloak tightly as her eyes flicker from the Wolf's mouth to the shadowed corners of the room. Red hesitated, taking a cautious step back as she clutched her cloak more tightly around her shoulders. The basket, still warm from her hurried walk, rested at her feet, but her attention was fixed on the figure in the bed. Something was wrong. Her gaze darted uneasily between the wolfish mouth—jagged with pointed teeth—and the dim corners where shadows seemed to stretch and curl. Her voice was barely above a whisper, edged with confusion and concern, as she studied the coarse fur bristling in the candlelight: "But your teeth, Grandmother—so pointed and so many—were they always so sharp when you smiled at me?"
The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, revealing more of its muzzle, eyes gleaming hungrily as Red takes an uncertain step forward, clutching her basket tighter. The wolf shifted beneath the covers, the rough patchwork of fur slipping further into view, and its amber eyes gleamed with a predatory hunger that made Red’s pulse quicken. She hesitated, tightening her grip on the basket, but the wolf’s voice curled through the dim room—soft, coaxing, almost grateful. It spoke of her breads, how their hearty crusts gave strength, the words dripping with false affection. “Come closer, my sweet,” the wolf beckoned, a sly smile tugging at its lips, “so I may thank you properly.” Red took another uncertain step, suspicion flickering in her narrowed gaze as she studied the coarse fur and the sharp, glinting teeth just visible beneath the covers.
Red clutches her basket tighter, her gaze flickering between the Wolf's hungry stare and the door behind her, as the Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, muscles tensing with anticipation. Red’s fingers tightened around the handle of her basket, knuckles paling as she tried to steady her breath. The Wolf’s hungry gaze never left her, glinting from beneath the patchwork quilt like twin lanterns flickering in the gloom. She set the basket down with care, heart pounding, and forced herself to step closer, her eyes narrowing as she studied the coarse fur peeking from the wrinkled collar. Hesitation rooted her feet to the floor, but curiosity—always stronger—pulled her forward. Voice trembling, Red finally dared to ask, unable to mask the unease threading through her words, why Grandmother’s eyes gleamed so fiercely in the dark, watching her with such unnatural intensity.
The Wolf lifts his head just a little, the covers slipping to reveal more of his bristling snout as his gaze fixes hungrily on Red. The Wolf lifted his head just a fraction, the threadbare quilt slipping to expose more of his bristling gray snout. His yellow eyes fastened on Red, hungry and unblinking. “My precious,” he murmured, voice velvet-soft but edged with something sharp, “the better to see your lovely face—and every blush that colors your cheeks.” As Red hesitated, he beckoned her closer with the promise of warmth, coaxing, “Come closer, don’t let shadows fall between us.”
RedShe edges slowly toward the door, her gaze darting between the Wolf’s glinting eyes and the exit. Red set the basket down with deliberate care, her fingers lingering on the handle as she edged closer to the figure in her grandmother’s bed. Her gaze flicked warily between the door and the coarse, unfamiliar fur peeking from beneath the covers. Clutching the basket tighter, she fought to steady her breath, her voice barely a whisper as suspicion sharpened her words. “Why does your breath sound so heavy, Grandmother,” she asked, eyes narrowing, “like a beast waiting in the woods?”
The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, the coarse fur rippling, eyes glinting as he stretches a clawed hand toward Red, who stands frozen, her heart pounding louder with each step she resists. The Wolf shifted beneath the covers, the coarse fur rippling in the half-light, and stretched a clawed hand toward Red, his eyes glinting with predatory patience. Red hesitated, her heart pounding louder with each step she resisted, the basket trembling slightly in her grip as she set it down. The Wolf’s voice, smooth and deceptively gentle, curled through the air as he beckoned her closer. “Ah, my child,” he purred, tilting his head just so, “that is only excitement at your visit—come closer, let me feel your warmth beside me.” His words slithered through Red’s thoughts, coaxing her forward as she narrowed her gaze, studying the figure’s coarse fur and the unsettling gleam behind those cunning eyes.
RedShe inches toward the foot of the bed, her grip on the basket white-knuckled, every instinct screaming that something is terribly wrong. Red inched toward the foot of the bed, her grip on the basket so tight her knuckles blanched. Every instinct screamed at her—something was wrong. She set the basket down, eyes narrowed, studying the figure nestled beneath the heavy quilt. The coarse fur bristled in the faint light, and her gaze flicked nervously to the door. Heart pounding, she forced herself to speak, voice steady but edged with suspicion. If Grandmother was truly glad to see her, then why did she keep her face buried so deep in the covers?
The Wolf's voice slips into a low, hungry rasp as one clawed paw slides out from beneath the quilt, reaching slowly toward Red. A low, hungry rasp curled from beneath the quilt as the Wolf shifted, one clawed paw slipping free, glinting in the faint light. He beckoned Red closer with a slow, deliberate motion, every inch of his movement calculated to lure her in. “Come closer still, child,” he murmured, the words heavy with false warmth, “and I will show you my face—only then will you know how truly happy I am to see you.” His gaze never left her, patient and predatory, watching for the moment her caution might falter.
RedShe edges toward the window, her knuckles white around the basket, her gaze fixed on the unfamiliar, hungry grin stretching beneath the covers. Red edged toward the window, her knuckles whitening around the handle of the basket. The familiar shape beneath the covers was all wrong—coarse fur where there should have been soft linen, an unfamiliar, hungry grin stretching across the shadowed face. She set the basket down with care, her gaze sharp and searching, heart pounding against her ribs. The air was thick with something wild, earthy, unsettling. Swallowing, Red forced herself to speak, though her voice trembled, each word heavy with dread. “Why do I smell the forest on you, Grandmother,” she asked, her nose wrinkling, “and not the lavender you always wore?”
The Wolf’s claws shift beneath the quilt, the coarse fur bristling as Red freezes, caught between terror and disbelief. The Wolf’s claws shifted restlessly beneath the quilt, the coarse fur prickling at the edges as Red hesitated, basket trembling in her hands. Sensing her uncertainty, the Wolf’s lips curled into a hungry grin, his eyes glinting with anticipation. “The better to remember where I found you, my dear,” he murmured, voice silk-wrapped steel, coaxing her closer with a crook of his paw. “Now come closer, and let me embrace you as only a true grandmother can.”
Throughout the exchange, Red continues to probe, her fear and suspicion mounting with each response.

Red clutches her basket tighter, her voice trembling as she takes a cautious step closer, peering into the shadows around the bed. Red tightened her grip on the wicker basket, fingertips whitening as she inched closer to the bed. Shadows flickered across the faded quilt, swallowing the familiar corners of her grandmother’s room. Her heart thudded with a mix of fear and determination, but she forced herself forward, peering anxiously into the dimness. Her voice wavered, barely above a whisper as she finally dared to ask, “Grandmother, why are your eyes so big tonight?”
The Wolf leans forward in the bed, folding his paws over the quilt, trying to smile reassuringly while keeping his gaze fixed on Red. The Wolf leaned forward in the bed, his large form casting a warped shadow against the flickering candlelight. Pale paws folded neatly atop the quilt, he summoned what he hoped was a gentle, reassuring smile, though his yellow eyes never once left Red’s face. “The better to see you with, my dear—” he murmured, voice smooth as silk, “it’s just the candlelight playing tricks, nothing more.”
Red hesitantly steps closer, her grip tightening around the basket as she peers into the shadows, voice trembling. Red hesitated at the threshold, the worn handle of her basket pressed tight against her palm. Shadows pooled in the corners of the cottage, and she could feel her own heartbeat pulsing in her throat. Still, she forced her feet forward, determination flickering in her chest—she had to be certain, for Grandmother’s sake. Peering into the gloom, her voice quivered despite her resolve. “And your ears—they seem so much longer than I remember.”
The Wolf tilts his head, straining his ears toward Red, while his eyes gleam hungrily in the dim light. The Wolf tilted his head, angling it as if to catch the faintest tremor in Red’s voice. His ears strained toward her, the pointed tips nearly quivering with anticipation, while his eyes glinted hungrily in the half-light that filtered through the cottage window. “The better to hear you whisper, my dear,” he purred, his tone silky and patient, each word laced with feigned affection. “I’ve been listening for your footsteps all evening.” The words lingered in the air, a subtle threat masked as tenderness, as he watched her edge closer, suspicion sharpening in her eyes.
Red hesitates, her voice trembling as she glances nervously at the claws barely hidden beneath the quilt. Red lingered at the edge of the bed, her fingers twisting nervously in the folds of her red cloak. She could feel her heart thudding in her chest as she glanced toward her grandmother—no, the figure beneath the quilt, its hands barely concealed but unmistakably changed. Summoning her courage, Red edged closer, her voice trembling with uncertainty as she tried to sound braver than she felt. "But your hands, Grandmother—they look so rough and sharp, not gentle like before," she managed, eyes fixed on the strange, clawed fingers peeking out where familiar softness should have been.
The Wolf slowly flexes his clawed fingers, trying to hide them beneath the blanket, his eyes never leaving Red. The Wolf shifted beneath the quilt, moving with a slow, deliberate grace. His clawed fingers, betraying their true nature, flexed once before he tucked them carefully under the blanket’s edge. All the while, his eyes glinted darkly, fixed on Red’s wary face as she edged closer, her voice trembling with a mixture of fear and determination. A thin smile curled at the Wolf’s lips as he murmured, “The better to hold you close, my dear—I've been working harder lately, perhaps that's why they've changed.” His words dripped with practiced warmth, but beneath them lurked a hunger he could not quite conceal.
Red takes a small step backward, clutching her basket tightly as her suspicion turns to fear. Red took a cautious step backward, her fingers tightening around the handle of her wicker basket. A cold ripple of fear chased away her earlier suspicion as she studied the figure before her—the firelight flickering across an unsettlingly broad mouth. Swallowing hard, she forced herself to speak, her voice barely above a whisper, trembling as she met the creature’s gaze. “Grandmother, what big teeth you have—so sharp and white in the firelight.”
Instead of immediately positioning herself between the bed and the door as in the original plot, Red now alternates between stepping closer and shrinking back, clutching her basket and casting furtive glances toward the door, her body language conveying her growing dread and readiness to escape or confront the imposter.

The Wolf's tail flicks beneath the blanket as he leans forward, his yellow eyes gleaming in the dim light. He forces a wide, toothy smile, drawing the patchwork quilt tighter beneath his chin. His ears twitch ever so slightly as Red steps closer, her gaze lingering on the sharpness of his features. The Wolf’s tail flicked, barely visible beneath the patchwork blanket, as he leaned forward into the dim glow. His yellow eyes shone with a predatory intensity, and when Red hesitated at the edge of the bed, her eyes searching the contours of his sharpened features, he smoothed the quilt higher under his chin, forcing a wide, toothy grin. His ears twitched, betraying a flicker of anticipation. “To better see you, my dear,” he purred, letting the words slip out with practiced warmth, every syllable calculated to draw her closer.
Red edges closer, her eyes narrowing as she studies the shape beneath the covers. Red edged closer, her worn boots barely making a sound on the crooked floorboards. Her eyes narrowed, suspicion flickering in their depths as she studied the strange, shifting bulk beneath the patchwork covers. Something about the outline unsettled her—the way the blanket bulged, the odd twitch of what might have been a tail. But she kept her voice steady, lacing it with just enough innocence to mask her apprehension. "But Grandmother, what big ears you have!" she said, her words cutting through the thick silence of the room as she tried to make sense of the unease knotting in her chest.
The Wolf's ears twitch as he offers a toothy smile, trying to appear gentle. The Wolf’s ears twitched, catching every nervous breath and tiny rustle in the dim room. A practiced, toothy grin split his muzzle as he leaned in closer, the blanket barely concealing the restless flick of his tail beneath. He let his gaze linger, softening his expression with feigned gentleness. “All the better to hear you with, my dear,” he murmured, his voice smooth and coaxing, each word carefully crafted to reassure even as his predatory eyes shone with hidden intent.
Red inches closer, her eyes darting from the Wolf's paws to his face, uncertainty tightening her voice. Red hesitated at the edge of the bed, her fingers gripping the folds of her red cloak. She inched closer, eyes flicking anxiously between the Wolf’s massive paws—half-hidden beneath the blanket—and his shadowed face. The uncertainty in her heart crept into her voice as she managed, “But Grandmother, what big hands you have!” The question hung in the stuffy room, her words trembling with both suspicion and concern as she tried to reconcile the figure before her with the grandmother she loved.
The Wolf's clawed fingers curl around the edge of the blanket, his eyes glinting with anticipation. The Wolf’s clawed fingers curled possessively around the edge of the blanket, the coarse fabric bunching beneath his grip. His eyes, bright with a predatory gleam, fixed on the girl standing before him. Beneath the covers, his tail flicked with barely contained anticipation. Leaning forward, his voice slipped through the room in a silken murmur, the words laced with a honeyed deception: all the better to hold you close, my dear.
Red steps back, her eyes wide as the Wolf's mouth curls into a sly grin beneath the blanket. Red instinctively stepped back, her breath catching as she took in the unsettling sight before her. There was something off about the way her grandmother lay in bed, the covers pulled up so high, the familiar face stretched into a strange, predatory grin. Beneath the blanket, a bushy tail flicked, barely visible. Red’s eyes lingered on the sharp glint of teeth revealed by that sly, unnatural smile, and, voice trembling with a mix of fear and disbelief, she managed to say, “But Grandmother, what sharp teeth you have!”
The scene concludes with Red's suspicions at a breaking point, her trembling voice and defensive posture signaling she is prepared to act if the Wolf makes a move.

----------------------------------------

As fear overtakes her, Red’s instincts propel her into action, shattering the tense standoff that has filled the shadowy room. The wolf lunges, but chaos erupts as Red’s quick thinking sets the scene into disarray. Behind her, the echo of the toppled lamp collides with her pounding heart, marking the beginning of a desperate flight. Little does she know, footsteps are already drawing near—the forest’s dangers have not gone unnoticed, and help may be closer than she thinks.

# Chapter 6: Red’s Desperate Escape and Huntsman’s Intervention

Red, her basket empty and cloak torn, flees through the tangled forest, terror evident as she runs not only from the Wolf but also from her own confusion and fear.

The Huntsman intercepts her as she stumbles, questioning her motives and her presence in the woods at dusk.

Red, shaken and bleeding, confesses her intent to visit her grandmother and her fear that something has been chasing her, though she hasn't dared look back.

Red scrambles backward, hands trembling as she pushes herself away from the log, eyes wide and fixed on the gleaming blade of the Huntsman's axe. Red scrambled backward, her heart hammering as her trembling hands slid across damp moss. She shoved herself away from the fallen log, unable to tear her gaze from the gleaming blade of the Huntsman’s axe. Fear and defiance mingled in her voice as she pleaded, “Please—don’t come any closer! I haven’t done anything wrong, I swear!”
The Huntsman lowers his axe slightly, eyes narrowed as he steps slowly toward Red, boots crunching leaves with deliberate weight. The Huntsman lowered his axe, muscles tense but movements measured, as he advanced through the dappled shade. His boots pressed the leaves into the damp earth with every careful step. Eyes narrowed, he studied the girl—Red—who had just stumbled in her haste. Voice low but steady, he called to her, “Easy now, girl—I'm not here to harm you,” his tone a mixture of reassurance and warning. Yet the vigilance in his posture never faltered as he continued, “But you'd best tell me why you're running through my woods at this hour.”
Red clutches her basket to her chest, backing away until her heel sinks into the damp moss, heart pounding in her ears. Red clutched her basket tightly to her chest, the woven handle digging into her fingers as she instinctively backed away. Her heel sank into the cushion of damp moss, nearly sending her sprawling, but she steadied herself just as a branch snapped behind her. Out of the birches surged the Huntsman, his axe glinting in the waning light. Red’s heart hammered in her chest, words tumbling out in a desperate rush: she was just trying to get to her grandmother’s cottage before dark—please, she pleaded, let her pass.
The Huntsman lowers his axe slightly, eyes narrowing as he steps closer, scanning Red and the shadowy trees beyond. The Huntsman lowered his axe, the blade glinting in the dappled afternoon light as he stepped closer, his gaze sharp and unyielding. He took in the ragged tear in Red’s cloak, the smear of blood staining her sleeve, and the frantic rise and fall of her breath. His eyes flicked from her to the trembling shadows behind, every muscle taut with vigilance. “Your cloak is torn, and there’s blood on your sleeve—did something follow you through these woods?” he asked, his voice low and steady, even as his fingers tightened around the haft of his axe, ready for whatever might emerge from the darkness.
Red clutches her basket tighter, eyes darting nervously between the shadowy trees and the Huntsman's stern face. Red stumbled, her boot catching on a mossy log, and nearly lost her grip on the basket. The trees pressed in, their shadows shifting uneasily. Suddenly, the Huntsman burst through a stand of birch, axe raised and eyes sharp. Red’s heart hammered against her ribs as she clutched her basket tighter, her gaze flickering between the looming trunks and the Huntsman’s stern silhouette. Breathless, she blurted out the words she’d been holding in, voice trembling: she thought something was chasing her—she hadn’t dared to look back, too terrified to risk it.
The Huntsman lowers his axe slightly, scanning the shadows as he steps protectively between Red and the darkness beyond the trees. The Huntsman emerged from the tangle of birch trees just as Red stumbled over a mossy log, his axe glinting in the dappled light. With practiced vigilance, he scanned the shifting shadows, every muscle coiled for action. Lowering his weapon just enough to signal a wary confidence, he stepped protectively between Red and the encroaching darkness. “Stay close behind me, Red,” he murmured, voice low but steady, his eyes never leaving the gloom beyond the trees. “If there’s danger in these woods, you’ll be safer at my side than alone.”
The Huntsman, suspicious yet protective, insists she remain close, promising safety as they move deeper into the forest together.

The Wolf emerges from the shadows, engaging in tense verbal sparring with the Huntsman rather than immediately threatening Red, revealing that his motives in the forest are layered and that he is as interested in secrets as he is in prey.

The Wolf's eyes gleam in the dim light, muscles coiled, voice low and rumbling as he fades deeper into the shadows, never taking his gaze off the Huntsman's weapon. The Wolf’s eyes gleamed with cold intelligence as he slunk deeper into the shifting shadows, every muscle taut and ready to spring. He never let the gleam of the Huntsman’s axe leave his sight, circling with slow, deliberate steps. A low, rumbling warning threaded through his words as he bared his teeth, the threat coiling beneath his calm. “Careful, Huntsman,” he growled, voice barely more than a whisper in the gloom, “your blade sings too close to my fur.” His gaze flickered, unblinking, as he dipped further into darkness, masking his true intentions. “I came for my own reasons, not to taste steel tonight.”
The HuntsmanHe tightens his grip on the axe handle, eyes narrowed, stepping sideways to keep the Wolf in his line of sight. The Huntsman tightened his grip on the axe handle, muscles tensing beneath his worn sleeves as he sidestepped, never letting the Wolf slip from his wary gaze. The creature bared its teeth, hackles raised, circling with calculated caution. Unfazed, the Huntsman advanced, the arc of his axe carving a warning through the chill air. Each measured step spoke of purpose, not bloodlust. He met the glint of the Wolf’s eyes and let his voice ring low and resolute—a clear reminder, not a threat. He swung not for sport, but to make it known: his woods were no place for prowlers who carried secrets in their shadows.
The Wolf's eyes flash with cunning as he circles tighter, hackles raised, muscles tensed for a leap or a retreat. The Wolf’s eyes glimmered with sly intelligence as he circled ever closer, his hackles bristling in anticipation, every muscle taut beneath his ragged pelt—poised for either a sudden attack or a swift retreat. As the Huntsman advanced, axe swinging in a slow, deliberate arc, the Wolf’s lips curled back in a calculated snarl, voice slipping from his throat like a dark promise. “Secrets run deep in these woods, Huntsman,” he murmured, his gaze never wavering, “and not all of them are yours to guard.”
The Huntsman tightens his grip on the axe, his gaze never leaving the Wolf as the tension thickens between them. The Huntsman’s knuckles whitened around the haft of his axe, eyes tracking every sinewy shift of the Wolf’s body as it circled him, lips curled back in a silent snarl. The air between them vibrated with menace. Without breaking his stride, the Huntsman advanced, his voice low and warning as he swung the axe in a slow, deliberate arc. “Then step lightly, Wolf,” he cautioned, the words edged with steel, “for even the shadows here have eyes—and some debts are paid in blood.”
The Huntsman warns the Wolf to keep his distance and asserts his authority over the woods.

Red clings to the Huntsman's arm, her voice trembling as she glances wildly over her shoulder at the shadowy woods, her heart pounding. Red scrambled to her feet, clutching the Huntsman’s arm as her breath fogged in the frigid air. Her heart hammered against her ribs, every muscle tense and ready to bolt. She threw a wild glance over her shoulder at the shifting shadows between the trees, then turned back to the Huntsman, her voice trembling. “Thank you—I… I didn’t see it coming. What was that thing? Are we safe now?”
The Huntsman casts a wary glance over his shoulder, tightening his grip on Red's arm as he leads her swiftly between the trees. The Huntsman cast a wary glance over his shoulder, his senses sharp to every crackle and whisper in the undergrowth. With a firm grip, he steadied Red as she scrambled to her feet, her breath curling in the chilly air. “We’re not safe yet,” he murmured, keeping his voice low and urgent as he guided her swiftly between the trees. “Stay close to me and keep quiet,” he cautioned, his gaze scanning the dense shadows ahead. “That creature hunts by sound—and there may be more nearby.”
Red's footsteps crunch softly on frosted leaves, her eyes darting nervously as she matches the Huntsman's brisk pace. Red scrambled upright, her palms stinging from the cold earth, breath curling in quick clouds as she blinked away the sting of fear. The Huntsman’s strong hand found her shoulder, steadying her before she could falter again. She nodded, swallowing hard against the tightness in her throat, and reached for his arm. With her fingers curled tightly around his sleeve, she hurried to keep pace, their footsteps muffled beneath a blanket of frost-laced leaves as they pressed deeper into the shadowed woods.
The Huntsman scans the dense undergrowth, his grip steady on Red's arm as he leads her swiftly along a winding, narrow path. Red scrambled to her feet, breath billowing in the frosty morning air. The Huntsman’s hand closed firmly around her arm, guiding her with practiced confidence along the winding, narrow trail as the tangled undergrowth clawed at their boots. His eyes swept the shadows, every muscle alert, every sense tuned to the dangers lurking just beyond sight. He leaned close, voice low but unwavering. “Stay sharp, Red; every step matters in these woods.” His grip was steady, reassurance and warning entwined. “I’ll get us through,” he promised, meeting her gaze with quiet conviction, “but you must trust me.”
Red clings to the Huntsman, grateful for his protection and still shaken by the encounter, while the Wolf retreats into the darkness, vowing that his hunger and intent remain.

The Wolf melts further into the shadows, eyes glinting with anticipation as he silently begins to stalk after the pair, each movement calculated and silent. The Wolf melted further into the shadows, every muscle poised, eyes glinting with anticipation as he watched the two figures slip deeper into the forest. Patience had always been his ally, and tonight was no different. He savored the way they wandered, oblivious and unguarded, weaving themselves ever deeper into his territory. Each silent step he took was calculated, every movement perfectly measured, as if he were tightening invisible threads around them—threads that would soon leave them ensnared in his web. The Wolf’s tail flicked, a subtle sign of his mounting excitement. Tonight, he would test their mettle. And if fortune favored him, his hunger would finally be sated.
The threat is not eliminated, and the Wolf's retreat is strategic rather than a defeat, setting up further tension as Red and the Huntsman press deeper into the woods, uncertain of what awaits them next.

Red clings to her basket, trembling, her eyes wide with lingering fear as she looks up at the Huntsman, tears of relief welling in her eyes. Red stumbled backward, her heart hammering against her ribs as she struggled to catch her breath. The forest shadows seemed to press in, thick and suffocating, until the stranger intervened. Relief flooded her cheeks with warmth. “I—I thought he was going to catch me!” she blurted out, still trembling. She clutched her red cloak tighter around her shoulders, voice quivering with gratitude. “Thank you, sir, thank you so much for saving me. I was so scared.” Her wide eyes sought reassurance, the fear not yet fully faded, but determination flickered beneath the surface—she would not let terror hold her back.
The Huntsman gently places a comforting hand on Red's shoulder, scanning the woods for any lingering danger. The Huntsman rested a reassuring hand on Red’s trembling shoulder, his sharp gaze sweeping the shadowed undergrowth for any sign of lingering menace. His voice, steady and certain, broke the hush of the forest as he assured her, "You're safe now, little one; the wolf won't trouble you anymore while I'm here."
----------------------------------------

As the adrenaline of the ordeal slowly ebbed away, a heavy silence settled over the small cottage, broken only by the distant calls of birds returning to the quiet woods. Shadows lengthened beneath the trees, and Red, clutching her basket, began to steady her breath, aware that everything had changed in the span of a few harrowing moments. With the wolf driven off but the memory of fear still fresh, both Red and her grandmother found themselves grappling with what had happened—and what it would mean for their lives moving forward. As dusk deepened, the three gathered inside, each lost in thought, ready to face the aftermath and consider how to protect themselves from danger that might yet linger in the heart of the forest.

# Chapter 7: Aftermath and New Resolve

Red stands near the old well, clutching her red cloak tightly as she distributes leftover bread to two hungry children.

Red's Mother approaches briskly, her hands still dusted with flour, and pulls Red aside, whispering about the need for caution after the previous night's events.

Red's MotherShe glances over her shoulder anxiously, lowering her voice even further as she squeezes Red's arm, her flour-dusted fingers leaving faint prints on Red's sleeve. Red’s mother approached briskly, the scent of fresh bread clinging to her clothes, and caught Red gently by the arm. Her flour-dusted fingers left pale smudges on Red’s sleeve as she glanced over her shoulder, anxiety tightening her features. In a low, urgent whisper, she drew Red a little closer. “Red, come here—quickly,” she murmured, her voice barely louder than a breath. “We can’t be careless, not after what happened last night.” The worry in her eyes sharpened as she squeezed Red’s arm, grounding herself as much as her child. “Promise me,” she pleaded softly, “you’ll keep your hood up and stay on the main path, no matter what.”
Red glances anxiously at the woods, clutching her red hood tighter around her shoulders. Red stood at the edge of the yard, her gaze flickering nervously toward the tangled shadows of the woods. She pulled her red hood tighter around her shoulders, as if the familiar fabric could shield her from the unknown. Behind her, the brisk sound of footsteps crunched across the packed earth—her mother, hands still dusted with flour, reached out and gently drew Red aside, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. Red swallowed, then managed to steady herself. “I promise, Mama,” she said, her words earnest but edged with worry. Still, she hesitated, searching her mother’s face for reassurance. “But I need to know—what if I see something strange again?”
Red's MotherShe squeezes Red's shoulder firmly, her brow furrowed with worry. Red’s mother approached quickly, her apron dusted white and her hands still streaked with flour. Worry etched deep lines across her brow as she took Red gently but firmly by the shoulder, pulling her just out of earshot. Her grip tightened, voice dropping to an anxious whisper. “If you see anything out of place, you come straight back to me—don’t stop, don’t speak, just come home.” The words were urgent, protective, weighted by all the stories she’d heard, and all the dangers she feared lurking in the shadowed woods beyond their door.
A cluster of villagers gather around, murmuring anxiously and glancing toward the edge of the forest.

VillagersOne villager wraps their shawl tighter, eyes darting nervously as others nod and whisper, casting worried glances toward the dark treeline. A knot of villagers clustered near the well, their voices hushed, faces drawn and anxious in the weak morning light. Old Marta, clutching her shawl tightly around her shoulders, leaned in and whispered to her neighbor, fear flickering in her eyes. “Did you hear it last night?” she asked, her words barely more than breath. “That strange howling coming from the woods—it sounded closer than ever.” Around her, others nodded, glancing nervously toward the shadowed treeline, each remembering loved ones lost and feeling the old chill of dread settle deep in their bones.
VillagersSeveral villagers clutch their shawls tighter, eyes darting nervously toward the dark line of trees. Several villagers huddled closer together, clutching their shawls tighter against the chill that seemed to seep from the shadowy forest. Their eyes darted nervously toward the dark line of trees, every snap of a twig setting their nerves further on edge. In a hushed, trembling voice, one woman leaned in and whispered, "And this morning, Old Marek found his fence torn clean through—said there were claw marks deeper than any wolf could make." The words seemed to hang in the air, drawing a ripple of anxious murmurs from the others as they exchanged worried glances, their fear growing with every retelling of the tale.
VillagersSeveral villagers huddle closer together, casting worried glances between the dark forest and each other. Several villagers huddled closer together, their voices hushed and eyes darting nervously between the looming forest and the thinning safety of their circle. One woman, clutching her shawl tighter around her shoulders, leaned in as if afraid the trees themselves might overhear. She whispered, her voice trembling, “My cousin swears she saw glowing eyes watching from the shadows, just beyond the tree line, before they vanished at dawn.” The others exchanged uneasy glances, each silently recalling their own tales or losses, as the chill of fear settled more heavily over the group.
VillagersThe villagers clutch their shawls tighter and draw a cautious step back from the edge, casting nervous glances into the deepening gloom beneath the trees. The villagers huddled together, clutching their shawls tighter as the evening chill crept in, their eyes wary and restless. Each time the wind rustled the leaves at the edge of the forest, they drew a cautious step back, as if even the shadows might swallow them whole. Low, anxious murmurs rippled through the group. Some, their faces drawn and pale, insisted in hushed voices that what haunted the woods was nothing less than the spirit of the forest itself, angered by some unseen trespass. Others, glancing fearfully toward the trees where dusk gathered thick and heavy, whispered that it was something older still—something that stirred only when the moon hung dark in the sky, and that fed beneath its shroud.
Red raises her voice, insisting that they must not let fear keep them from helping each other, and volunteers to help repair the broken fence near Grandmother's cottage.

Red steps forward confidently, her voice ringing out as she surveys the gathered villagers, her eyes shining with resolve. Red took a bold step forward, her red cloak catching the evening light as she faced the circle of anxious villagers. Determination burned in her eyes, and when she spoke, her voice was clear and unwavering, carrying across the square. She wouldn’t let their apprehension silence her. “We can't let fear rule our lives,” she declared, scanning the worried faces before her. “If we all hide away, who's going to look out for each other?” There was no hesitation as she nodded toward the woods, where her grandmother’s cottage stood beyond the broken fence that had become a symbol of their unease. “I say we fix that fence near Grandmother's cottage together.” She lifted her chin, already moving toward the path that led into the trees. “I'll go first—who's with me?”
VillagersSeveral villagers glance nervously at each other, hesitating to step forward. Several villagers lingered at the edge of the gathering, their eyes darting uneasily from one anxious face to another. None seemed eager to be the first to speak, but the fear in the air was palpable, thick as the mist that crept in from the woods. At last, one man—his voice barely above a whisper—summoned the courage to break the tense silence. "But Red," he asked, his words trembling with dread, "what if the wolf comes back while we're out there?" The question hung between them, echoing the unspoken worries churning in every heart.
Red steps forward confidently, looking each villager in the eye to encourage them. Red stepped forward, the hem of her scarlet cloak brushing the packed earth as she met each villager’s gaze in turn. Her voice, clear and unwavering, carried over the uneasy murmurs. “If we stand together, the wolf won’t dare come near—courage is stronger when we share it.” She let her words hang in the air, hoping her conviction would kindle something brave in every heart, refusing to let fear claim their village.
The villagers, motivated by Red's determination, agree to form a watch group, while Red's Mother reluctantly hands Red a small satchel of herbs for Grandmother.

VillagersThe villagers gather closer together, some exchanging worried glances, but one by one nodding in agreement, emboldened by Red's determination. A few pick up lanterns and pitchforks, forming an impromptu watch group at the village edge. The villagers drew closer together, their faces pale and anxious in the lantern light. Some exchanged uneasy glances, clutching each other’s sleeves as if afraid the shadows might swallow them whole. But gradually, emboldened by Red’s fierce resolve, one after another nodded in agreement. Perhaps it was wrong to just sit and wait, some thought, murmured quietly among themselves. Red had shown more courage than any of them, and if she was willing to risk the forest, then surely they could do their part too.

A few men stepped forward, hands trembling but determined as they picked up lanterns and pitchforks from nearby doorways. Others joined them, forming an impromptu watch at the village edge. Tonight and tomorrow, they would keep guard, scanning the dark borders for any sign of the wolf. Nothing would sneak up on Red—or on them—if their vigilance could help it.
Red's MotherRed's mother presses a small satchel into Red's hands, her fingers lingering with worry before letting go. Red’s mother pressed a small satchel into her daughter’s hands, her fingers lingering for a moment longer than necessary, worry etched deep in her brow. She searched Red’s face, her voice low and trembling with the weight of her concern. “Are you sure about this?” She knew she couldn’t stop Red—her daughter’s resolve was unyielding—but she could at least try to keep her safe. “Take these herbs for your grandmother,” she insisted, smoothing the edge of Red’s cloak with anxious hands. “And promise me you’ll be careful.” The words hovered between them, heavy and urgent, as she finally let go.
Red accepts the satchel, squeezes her mother's hand, then turns to nod resolutely at the gathered villagers before heading toward the forest path. Red accepted the satchel from her mother, the weight of it grounding her resolve. She squeezed her mother’s hand—warm, trembling, lingering just a moment longer than usual—then straightened her shoulders and turned to face the cluster of villagers. Their faces were etched with worry, but beneath it glimmered a newfound determination, reflecting the courage she struggled to hold onto. Red offered them a steady nod, her red cloak catching the morning light. With a voice soft but unwavering, she promised, “I will, Mother. And thank you—each of you. With your watchful eyes and these healing herbs, I’ll bring Grandmother hope and keep our village safe.” She drew a deep breath, then stepped toward the shadowed mouth of the forest path, her resolve lighting the way ahead.
The objective is to organize a communal response after the wolf attack;

the result is a renewed sense of shared purpose, with Red preparing for another journey to Grandmother's house and the villagers agreeing to support her efforts.
