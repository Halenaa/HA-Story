'You shouldn't be in the forest alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and urgent. Rather than simply mentioning wolves, he points out deep, high claw marks on a birch. 'See these marks? Fresh. Too deep for wolf, too high for bear. Something else prowls these woods tonight—something clever enough to watch, but strong enough not to fear us.' He leans in, lowering his voice, and adds, 'At first light, I found tracks—fresh, too fresh for comfort. The forest's edge is no longer safe, not with footsteps I can't name. Let me escort you; whatever left those marks may still be near.' Red glances toward the sun-dappled path, her resolve flickering but not extinguished. 'My grandmother needs me.

Red hesitates, then replies, 'I'm bringing food and medicine to my grandmother.' The Wolf narrows his eyes, studying Red for signs of fear, and replies, 'Such a good granddaughter. Is her house far from here?' As Red points deeper into the woods, The Wolf’s tail flicks, and he circles her, scanning the path for shortcuts. Red watches him warily, her grip tightening on the basket, while The Wolf, masking his hunger, plots a quicker route to Grandmother’s cottage.
