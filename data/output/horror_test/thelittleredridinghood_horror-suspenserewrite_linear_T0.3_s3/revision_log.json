However, this addition does not contradict character motivations or actions; it serves to establish the Wolf's intentions and threat level earlier. The plot is updated to incorporate the Wolf's vow within the same chapter, maintaining narrative consistency.",

The original plot only mentioned wolf tracks. The updated plot incorporates the Huntsman's new observations and warnings about an unspecified, more mysterious danger, ensuring consistency with the dialogue, while maintaining Red's motivation and the flow to the next scene.",

The Wolf’s deception lasts longer, and the confrontation escalates verbally before the Wolf drops his disguise and threatens Grandmother directly. The plot is updated to reflect Grandmother’s increased suspicion and active resistance, as well as the Wolf’s extended manipulation and eventual aggression, rather than a swift entry and immediate physical threat.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue extends and intensifies the original confrontation, adding more rounds of questioning and emotional beats. Red no longer simply positions herself between bed and door; instead, her behavior oscillates between approach and retreat, reflecting a more complex mixture of fear, suspicion, and readiness to defend herself. This requires updating the plot to reflect Red's increased emotional tension and the more elaborate probing interaction.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shifts Red's motivation from defiant independence to visible fear and vulnerability—she pleads with the Huntsman and relies on him for protection, rather than bravely scrambling away and only accepting help after the Wolf is driven off. The Huntsman interrogates Red about her reasons for being in the woods, showing suspicion before offering protection, and the Wolf engages in a tense exchange with the Huntsman, focusing more on secrets and territory than direct predation. Red's gratitude and dependence on the Huntsman is more explicit, and the Wolf's retreat is framed as strategic. The updated plot incorporates these nuances, maintaining character logic and natural progression.",
