Red’s mother inspects the basket, adding extra cloth to keep the food warm, and glances warily toward the forest visible through the open door. She warns Red, her voice low and urgent: 'Stay on the path, and speak to no one. The wolf grows bolder.' Red, eager to prove her independence, insists she’ll be careful and sets her jaw as she slings the basket over her arm. Her mother reaches for Red’s shoulder, hesitating before letting her go. The kitchen fills with the scrape of the chair as Red stands and the creak of the door as she steps outside, determined to reach Grandmother before midday.",

She steps forward, boots sinking slightly into the muddy path, determined to reach her grandmother's cottage before noon. Suddenly, a twig snaps—The Huntsman strides from behind a spruce, his axe slung over one shoulder and a wary glance sweeping the woods. He raises a gloved hand to halt Red, his brow furrowed. 'You shouldn't be in the forest alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and urgent. Red glances toward the sun-dappled path and insists, 'My grandmother needs me. I can handle myself.' The Huntsman steps closer, lowering his voice and gesturing at claw marks gouged into a nearby birch. He recounts finding fresh tracks at dawn and insists on escorting her. Red, driven by her desire to prove her independence, reluctantly agrees, and together they advance along the winding trail, boots crunching through last year's leaves and eyes alert for danger.",

She pauses, scanning the undergrowth for movement, when The Wolf emerges from behind a twisted oak, his fur bristling and nose twitching as he sniffs the air. The Wolf steps onto the path, blocking Red's way. He tilts his head and asks, 'Where are you going on such a lonely trail, little girl?' Red hesitates, then replies, 'I'm bringing food and medicine to my grandmother.' The Wolf narrows his eyes, studying Red for signs of fear, and replies, 'Such a good granddaughter. Is her house far from here?' As Red points deeper into the woods, The Wolf’s tail flicks, and he circles her, scanning the path for shortcuts. Red watches him warily, her grip tightening on the basket, while The Wolf, masking his hunger, plots a quicker route to Grandmother’s cottage. The encounter ends with Red hurrying down the path, glancing back, while The Wolf melts into the undergrowth, paws silent on the damp earth, intent on reaching the cottage first.",

The Wolf scratches at the door, voice pitched to mimic Red’s, saying, 'Grandmother, let me in; I’ve brought your supper.' Grandmother hesitates, peers through the peephole, and unlocks the door with trembling hands. As the door swings open, the Wolf lunges forward, nudging Grandmother aside and slipping inside. His objective is to gain entry and corner the vulnerable woman; Grandmother’s aim is to verify her visitor and protect herself. The scene ends with the Wolf inside, scanning the dim cottage for food and opportunity, while Grandmother stumbles back toward her bedside, calling out for help.",

The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's nightcap and shawl, reclines on the bed, turning his head toward Red and beckoning her closer with a raspy imitation of Grandmother's voice. Red sets the basket down and approaches, her eyes narrowing as she studies the figure's coarse fur peeking from beneath the covers and the sharpened outline of teeth when the Wolf speaks: 'Come closer, child, so I can see your lovely cloak.' Red, motivated to protect her grandmother and prove her suspicion, edges closer and asks, 'Grandmother, why are your eyes so big tonight?' The Wolf's tail flicks beneath the blanket as he leans forward, replying, 'To better see you, my dear.' Red grips the handle of the basket, preparing to act if the imposter reveals himself. The scene concludes with Red positioning herself between the bed and the door, determined to expose the Wolf's disguise.",

As Red stumbles over a mossy log, the Huntsman bursts through a stand of birch trees, axe raised, boots thudding on the soft earth. He positions himself between Red and the Wolf, voice stern: 'Step away from the girl.' The Wolf bares his teeth, circling warily, but as the Huntsman advances, swinging his axe in a warning arc, the Wolf snarls and darts back into the shadows. Red scrambles to her feet, her breath visible in the chilly air, and the Huntsman steadies her with a gloved hand, guiding her quickly out of the clearing. The Wolf watches from the darkness, tail flicking, plotting his next move as the two disappear down a winding trail. The objective—Red’s escape from the Wolf—is achieved through the Huntsman’s timely intervention; the Wolf is forced to retreat, but the threat remains.",
