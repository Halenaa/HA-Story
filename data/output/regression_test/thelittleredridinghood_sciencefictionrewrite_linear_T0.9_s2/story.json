It extends a compartment, releasing a cold, data-sealed package into Red’s palm. Red checks the biometric lock, then syncs her neural link to the mission parameters. The drone updates her on rogue unit activity near the restricted zone and cautions her to avoid Sector 7. Red secures the package inside her reinforced jacket, nods sharply, and moves toward the exit gate, boots scraping on dew-slick metal. Her motivation to earn a system upgrade and protect her grandmother drives her to review alternate routes, while the drone’s directive is to ensure the package’s safe transfer, prompting its detailed warnings.",

Red kneels, prying open a maintenance hatch with a magnetic tool, while the drone recites access protocols. Red overrides the gate’s circuitry, causing it to stutter open with a grinding shriek.

'Restricted zone ahead,' it intones, projecting a crimson map overlay. Red tightens the strap on her courier pack, whispering, 'Override perimeter protocol. I need a distraction.' The drone dips lower, releasing a puff of static to jam local sensors. Red vaults over a tangle of roots, boots splashing in muddy puddles as she slips past a flickering security cam. The drone updates her: 'Wolfbot presence detected, probability of interception high.' Red nods, jaw set, and signals the drone to deploy a decoy beacon deeper into the mist, drawing off two approaching Patrol Bots.
