Red secures the package inside her reinforced jacket, nods sharply, and moves toward the exit gate, boots scraping on dew-slick metal. Her motivation to earn a system upgrade and protect her grandmother drives her to review alternate routes, while the drone’s directive is to ensure the package’s safe transfer, prompting its detailed warnings."}}

The drone updates her: 'Wolfbot presence detected, probability of interception high.' Red nods, jaw set, and signals the drone to deploy a decoy beacon deeper into the mist, drawing off two approaching Patrol Bots. Her objective is to breach the perimeter without detection; as she disappears into the underbrush, the drone's warning echoes behind her, but the Patrol Bots turn toward the decoy, clearing her path for now."}}
