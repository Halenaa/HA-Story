        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue introduces a formal refusal by Red in line with protocol, which is not present in the original plot summary. Instead of outright accepting the assignment, Red complies with protocol by formally refusing before continuing, indicating a procedural necessity rather than pure defiance. Additionally, the dialogue shows a higher emphasis on real-time coordination, security escalation, and adherence to procedures, with Red repeatedly confirming protocol steps and only requesting deviation permission if necessary. The updated plot reflects these added layers of procedural compliance and heightened security context, maintaining character motivations and the natural progression of events.",

This is more dialogic and less covert than the original summary, which described her overriding orders without discussion. The updated plot incorporates Red's verbal confrontation and negotiation before her defiant actions, maintaining character logic and continuity.",

The original plot had Red advance cautiously and trigger a trap, but the dialogue shows her maintaining distance, challenging Wolf-9, and refusing to play along. The updated plot reflects this behavioral shift, emphasizing a tense verbal confrontation over a physical one.",
