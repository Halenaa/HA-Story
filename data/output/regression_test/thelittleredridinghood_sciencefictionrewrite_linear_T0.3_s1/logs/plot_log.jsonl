The Head Dispatcher slides a sealed data chip marked with a red security band across the scratched surface, his gaze fixed on Red’s chassis. He warns, 'Quarantine Sector’s off-limits for most, Red. Protocol says you refuse.' Red taps the chip with a finger, her optics cycling through encryption layers, then pockets it, replying, 'I’ll deliver. Just patch me through to the boundary gate.' The dispatcher keys in the gate override, sending a location ping to Red’s internal map, then leans closer, lowering his voice, 'Don’t improvise. Authority Commander’s on alert.' Red nods, already rerouting her navigation heuristics and prepping firewall countermeasures, her decision driven by loyalty to her grandmother and curiosity about the classified package. The rain intensifies, tapping out code-like rhythms as Red steps toward the exit, assignment accepted."}}

She jacks into exposed wires, overriding the gate's biometric scanner with rapid keystrokes and occasional glances over her shoulder. The red warning lights pulse, illuminating her silver chassis as she uploads a spoofed access code. Suddenly, a metallic clatter behind her makes Red spin. Wolf-9 emerges from the shadows, his matte-black carapace shimmering with rivulets of rain, optic sensors flickering as he scans her. He projects a distorted vocal pattern, mimicking an official city dispatcher: 'Courier Red, unauthorized access detected. Stand down and surrender the package.' Red narrows her optics, keeps her interface cable locked in the terminal, and retorts, 'You're not on my clearance list. Identify.' Wolf-9's forelimbs spread, claws scraping on the wet ground as he advances, intent on intercepting her and accessing the data port. Red yanks her cable free, slamming the terminal shut, and darts for the half-open gate as the locking mechanism disengages with a grinding whine. Wolf-9 lunges, his movements precise and predatory, but Red slips through the gap, the cold rain spattering her chassis, leaving Wolf-9 snarling as the gate slams closed between them."}}

The Head Dispatcher, his voice sharp through a comm-link, orders Red to abort the delivery due to escalating danger, referencing new Authority patrols and Wolf-9 sightings. Red, driven by loyalty to her grandmother, disables the dispatch override with a rapid sequence of code hacks and physically disconnects her tracker module, letting it clatter into the gutter. She then slips into the shadowed entrance of the quarantine sector, the hiss of rain muffling the fading echo of the Dispatcher's warnings. Red’s defiant actions override protocol, propelling her toward her objective despite heightened risk."}}

She calls out for Grandmother, but the response comes in a voice modulated with synthetic warmth. Wolf-9, having overridden the security grid and disguised itself using Grandmother's biometric data, sits hunched at the table, fingers tracing the edge of a forbidden biotech package. Red advances cautiously, her hacking protocols primed, while Wolf-9 beckons her closer, attempting to lure her with feigned concern. Red detects a mismatch in vocal cadence and surreptitiously triggers a silent distress beacon. Wolf-9 springs its trap, activating nanoweb snares from beneath the table, but Red leaps back, launching an EMP pulse that shorts the snares and exposes Wolf-9's true form. The confrontation leaves the room scorched and the package unclaimed, forcing Wolf-9 to retreat into the storm outside while Red seals the hatch and recalibrates her threat assessment systems."}}

Red flicks a firewall signal at Wolf-9, forcing it to recoil and shift tactics, as it attempts to override her comms with a pulse transmission. Ignoring the interference, Red steps forward, physically blocks the doorway, and activates her emergency encryption, making a split-second decision—she reroutes the package's biometric lock to her grandmother’s DNA, denying Wolf-9 access. Wolf-9 lunges, but Red triggers a high-voltage trap from the lab’s panel, sending sparks cascading and forcing Wolf-9 to retreat into the smoke, unable to assimilate the technology. Red’s actions secure the package for now, but she knows Wolf-9 will adapt and return."}}

If Wolf-9 gets this, the city won't survive.' Red, driven by loyalty and urgency, initiates a secure data wipe protocol, while Grandmother retrieves a containment flask, preparing to destroy the contents if needed. As Red's sensors alert her to movement outside—scavenger bots or worse—she signals Grandmother to hurry. The two work in tandem: Red encrypts the lab entrance, while Grandmother begins the neutralization sequence, their actions synchronized by necessity. The outcome: the genome key's fate will be decided in moments, as Red and Grandmother brace for imminent intrusion."}}
