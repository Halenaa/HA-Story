Protocol says you refuse.' Red, following strict protocol, formally refuses the assignment in words for the record, stating operational integrity. However, the Head Dispatcher, trusting Red's capabilities and judgment, proceeds to brief her on the classified retrieval mission.

Wolf-9 emerges from the shadows, his matte-black carapace shimmering with rivulets of rain, optic sensors flickering as he scans her. He projects a distorted vocal pattern, mimicking an official city dispatcher: 'Courier Red, unauthorized access detected. Stand down and surrender the package.' Red narrows her optics, keeps her interface cable locked in the terminal, and retorts, 'You're not on my clearance list. Identify.' Wolf-9's forelimbs spread, claws scraping on the wet ground as he advances, intent on intercepting her and accessing the data port. Red yanks her cable free, slamming the terminal shut, and darts for the half-open gate as the locking mechanism disengages with a grinding whine.
