She taps a coded knock on the steel door, signaling her arrival. Inside, Dr. Mira disables the electromagnetic lock and pulls Red into the lab, quickly resealing the entrance. The lab is cluttered with makeshift tech, humming servers, and the faint scent of soldered wires. Dr. Mira slides a palm-sized quantum data crystal across the workbench, instructing Red to deliver it to Finn at the Rebel safehouse before Overwatch can trace its signal. Red pockets the crystal, adjusts her hood, and checks her route on a cracked tablet, determined to evade surveillance. As the lab’s lights flicker, both listen for the telltale mechanical whir of approaching supply drones outside, knowing time is running short.",

She passes it to Finn, who quickly wipes it on his sleeve and slides it into a battered decryption terminal. The terminal beeps and hums, fans whirring, as Finn’s fingers dart over the keypad to initiate the download. Vera stands behind them, arms crossed, eyes scanning the room’s corners for signs of surveillance, her voice low: 'We can’t afford delays. Is the transfer secure?' Finn nods, glancing at the flickering status lights. Red paces, glancing at the rain-smeared windows, her jaw set. As the crystal’s data transfers, Vera moves to the comms panel, sending a coded message to other cells. Outside, the thunder covers the sound of Red’s nervous footsteps as she circles the crates, determined the data reaches its destination. The scene ends as Finn disconnects the crystal, handing it back to Red with a curt, 'We got it. Now move.'",
