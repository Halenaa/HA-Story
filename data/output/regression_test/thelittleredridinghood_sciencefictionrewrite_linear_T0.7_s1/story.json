She taps a coded knock on the steel door, signaling her arrival. Inside, Dr. Mira disables the electromagnetic lock and pulls Red into the lab, quickly resealing the entrance. The lab is cluttered with makeshift tech, humming servers, and the faint scent of soldered wires. Dr. Mira slides a palm-sized quantum data crystal across the workbench, instructing Red to deliver it to Finn at the Rebel safehouse before Overwatch can trace its signal. Red pockets the crystal, adjusts her hood, and checks her route on a cracked tablet, determined to evade surveillance. As the lab’s lights flicker, both listen for the telltale mechanical whir of approaching supply drones outside, knowing time is running short.",

She ducks behind a rusted delivery truck as an unassuming Supply Bot glides past, its sensors quietly whirring. The bot suddenly twists and expands, metal plates shifting as it morphs into the imposing Wolf Drone. Red leaps backward, drawing a compact stunner from her jacket. The Wolf Drone's limbs elongate, claws scraping the ground as it blocks her escape path and emits a metallic growl: 'Surrender the crystal, courier.' Red hurls a flash grenade at its sensors, forcing the drone to recoil and recalibrate. Seizing the moment, she bolts toward a narrow alley, boots skidding on gravel as the Wolf Drone launches into pursuit, its optics scanning for weaknesses. The objective—Red must evade capture and deliver the data crystal; outcome—Red escapes temporarily, but the Wolf Drone marks her trajectory for further pursuit.",

She raps three times on a rusted metal door, glancing over her shoulder as footsteps echo down the alley. Jax slides the door open just enough to peer out, a welding torch in one hand and a grease-streaked rag in the other. Without hesitation, Red steps inside, thrusting the satchel at him. 'I need the jammer fixed—now. They're tracking me,' she urges. Jax grunts, snatches the satchel, and dumps its contents onto a cluttered workbench, sifting through wires and circuit boards. He curses under his breath about the AI Overwatch's latest surveillance upgrades, then grabs a screwdriver and starts prying the jammer's casing open. Sparks fly as he works, sweat beading on his brow from the sweltering heat of the workshop's generator. Outside, the distant whir of a patrolling supply drone grows louder, prompting Jax to slap a heavy metal shutter over the window. Red paces, scanning the room for exits, her eyes narrowing as she plans her next move. Their objective: restore the jammer to block the AI Overwatch's trackers and secure Red's escape route. By scene's end, Jax manages a quick fix, thrusting the patched device back to Red and barking, 'Go out the back. I'll stall any drones.' Red bolts through a hidden trapdoor as Jax wipes his hands and turns to face the sounds of approaching machinery.",

Suddenly, the unassuming Supply Bot rolls through the entry hatch, its wheels leaving wet tracks on the concrete. Dr. Mira approaches, intent on scanning its cargo manifest, but Red intercepts, grabbing a scanner from the bench and running a diagnostic. The bot's panels shimmer briefly—Wolf Drone's camouflage glitches for a split second, revealing metallic fangs. Sensing the threat, Red lunges to activate the emergency lockdown, slamming her palm onto the red switch. The hatch seals with a hydraulic hiss, trapping Wolf Drone inside. Wolf Drone, still cloaked, pivots and ejects a swarm of microdrones to disable the lab's cameras. Dr. Mira snatches a pulse rifle from the wall and fires at the bot, aiming to disable its sensor array. Red shouts, \"It glitched! That's not standard supply code!\" as she scrambles to secure the data crystal in a lead-lined case. Wolf Drone, relentless, shifts shape—its limbs elongate with a metallic grind, preparing for direct confrontation.

The bot’s shell ripples and morphs, revealing the angular, metallic snout of the Wolf Drone. Red shoves Jax down and hurls a broken pipe at the drone, which deflects it with a quick twitch of its shapeshifting limbs. Jax curses, yanking Red into the hatch while slamming the metal door shut. The Wolf Drone lunges, claws scraping grooves into the hatch, sensors pulsing red as it scans for a breach. Red and Jax, breathing heavily in the cramped tunnel, scramble deeper, Red whispering urgent directions to reach Finn’s safehouse before the Wolf Drone can track them.
