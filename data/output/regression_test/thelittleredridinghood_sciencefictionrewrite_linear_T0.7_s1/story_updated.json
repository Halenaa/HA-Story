She taps a coded knock on the steel door, signaling her arrival. Inside, Dr. Mira disables the electromagnetic lock and pulls Red into the lab, quickly resealing the entrance. The lab is cluttered with makeshift tech, humming servers, and the faint scent of soldered wires. Dr. Mira slides a palm-sized quantum data crystal across the workbench, instructing Red to deliver it to Finn at the Rebel safehouse before Overwatch can trace its signal. Red pockets the crystal, adjusts her hood, and checks her route on a cracked tablet, determined to evade surveillance. As the lab’s lights flicker, both listen for the telltale mechanical whir of approaching supply drones outside, knowing time is running short.",

The Wolf Drone's limbs elongate, claws scraping the ground as it blocks her escape path and emits a metallic growl: 'Surrender the crystal, courier.' Red hurls a flash grenade at its sensors, forcing the drone to recoil and recalibrate. Seizing the moment, she bolts toward a narrow alley, boots skidding on gravel as the Wolf Drone launches into pursuit, its optics scanning for weaknesses.

They're tracking me. The Agency knows I took the drive.' Jax, without hesitation, sweeps the jammer's remains onto his workbench and begins repairing at a frantic pace, sweat beading on his brow. Outside, the whir of a supply drone grows louder. Jax, cursing the Agency's surveillance, slaps a shutter over the window. Red paces, scanning for exits, her nerves taut. Finally, Jax thrusts the hastily patched jammer into her hands. 'I’ve bypassed the fail-safe. It won’t hold long. Get out the back—now. Don’t stop for anything.'

Suddenly, the unassuming Supply Bot rolls through the entry hatch, its wheels leaving wet tracks on the concrete. Dr. Mira approaches, intent on scanning its cargo manifest, but Red, noticing something off, intercepts first, grabbing a scanner from the bench and running a diagnostic. She exclaims, 'It glitched! No way—that wasn't supposed to happen!' and quickly observes, 'Wait a second, that's not standard supply code! We're supposed to use protocol S-17 for all incoming shipments. Where did this come from, and why isn't it logged under the usual procedures?' As Red investigates further, the bot's panels shimmer briefly—Wolf Drone's camouflage glitches for a split second, revealing metallic fangs. Sensing the threat, Red lunges to activate the emergency lockdown, slamming her palm onto the red switch. The hatch seals with a hydraulic hiss, trapping Wolf Drone inside. Wolf Drone, still cloaked, pivots and ejects a swarm of microdrones to disable the lab's cameras. Dr. Mira snatches a pulse rifle from the wall and fires at the bot, aiming to disable its sensor array. Red scrambles to secure the data crystal in a lead-lined case, the urgency heightened by her discovery. Wolf Drone, relentless, shifts shape—its limbs elongate with a metallic grind, preparing for direct confrontation.

Their exchange escalates as they weigh the risks: Jax emphasizes the need for stealth to avoid tripping sensors, while Red pushes for urgency to stay ahead of Wolf Drone. Ultimately, they compromise—Jax agrees to trigger a distraction at the right moment, giving Red the window she needs to move quickly and plant an EMP charge at the command node.
