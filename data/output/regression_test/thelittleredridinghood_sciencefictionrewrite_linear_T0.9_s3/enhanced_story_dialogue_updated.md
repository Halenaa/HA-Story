# Chapter 1: Mission Assignment: Deliver the Data-Core

Mother locks the reinforced door and checks the security monitor, visibly anxious as she pulls a heavy data-core from her tool belt.

She places it on the table, sliding it toward Red, who tightens her courier satchel and scans the blinking device with her reader.

Sensing the heightened danger, Mother repeatedly emphasizes the seriousness of the mission, her voice urgent and emotional.

Mother glances at the terminal, her fingers tapping an anxious rhythm as she double-checks the surveillance feed. Mother’s gaze flickered to the terminal, her fingers tapping out a tense, staccato rhythm as she brought up the surveillance feed. She paused just long enough to glance at Red’s security drone, her voice low and brisk as she confirmed, “Drone’s charge looks good.” But her eyes didn’t leave the screen for long; she was already scanning for movement in the northern sector. “Listen to me,” she continued, her words clipped with urgency. “You know the route, but Wolf’s drones have doubled up around the north. Whatever you do, avoid the old rail yard.” Her jaw tightened, the worry etched deep in the lines of her face. “If you’re spotted, I won’t be able to help you. So move fast, stay low, and stick to the shadows.” Every word was weighted with the kind of experience only years in the colony’s wilderness could earn.
She warns Red that Wolf’s drones have doubled their patrols in the north sector, especially near the old rail yard, and insists Red avoid it at all costs.

Mother checks the charge on Red’s security drone, then, with repeated pleas, instructs Red to not talk to anyone, to keep moving no matter what, and to promise that she will be careful and follow every instruction.

Mother presses the battered comm-link into Red’s hand, her eyes searching Red’s face for understanding, her grip lingering on Red’s shoulder as if reluctant to let go. Mother pressed the battered comm-link into Red’s palm, her fingers rough and warm against the younger girl’s skin. Her eyes, sharp with worry, searched Red’s face as if memorizing every freckle and line of determination. “Red, listen to me—this is more important than anything,” she said quietly, her voice edged with a gravity that stilled the air between them. Her grip lingered on Red’s shoulder, reluctant to let go, as she continued, “You have to get this to your grandmother, no matter what. She’s counting on you, and so am I.” The words hung between them, heavy with all the dangers the wilderness and rogue AIs might hold. As she finally released her hold, her gaze softened, and she added, almost in a whisper, “Promise me you’ll be careful.”
Mother hands Red a battered comm-link, squeezing her shoulder tightly, making her desperation clear.

Mother grips her child's shoulders gently, her eyes scanning the room as if expecting danger to appear at any moment. Mother’s hands settled firmly but gently on her child’s shoulders, her fingers instinctively tightening as her gaze swept the dim corners of the room. Every shadow seemed to pulse with unseen threats, her body tense with the memory of dangers lurking just outside their fragile walls. “Listen to me very carefully,” she murmured, her voice low but urgent, each word chosen with the care of someone who had seen too much. “You must not talk to anyone, no matter what.” She searched her child’s face, her expression softening with regret. “I know it’s hard,” she admitted, her thumb brushing a reassuring circle against the child’s sleeve, “but it’s the only way to keep you safe right now.” Her eyes, sharp and anxious, locked onto her child’s. “Promise me you understand,” she whispered, as if the very walls might be listening.
Red, taking in her mother’s anxious insistence, secures the data-core and comm-link, peeks through the blinds, and heads for the exit with her drone at her side.

Mother grips your shoulders tightly, her eyes wide with fear and urgency. Her voice trembles, but her resolve is fierce as she gently pushes you toward the door, glancing anxiously over her shoulder. Mother’s grip tightened on your shoulders, her fingers trembling ever so slightly despite the fierce resolve in her gaze. She gently steered you toward the door, her movements hurried and protective, as if her own steadiness might shield you from the chaos outside. “No matter what happens,” she whispered, her voice rough with emotion, “no matter what you hear, you keep moving.” Her eyes darted anxiously over her shoulder, scanning for any hint of danger. “Don’t stop for anything,” she insisted, almost pleading. “Promise me.” The urgency in her voice left no room for argument. “If you stop—even for a moment—they’ll catch up to you.” She swallowed hard, her fear palpable. “I can’t lose you. Please, do exactly as I say.”
Objective: Assign the mission and prepare Red for departure, with Mother’s heightened concern and repeated warnings setting a tense, emotional tone.

Outcome: Red receives the data-core and exits, mission underway.

----------------------------------------

The heavy door slid shut behind Red, sealing her mother’s anxious face from view. The weight of the data-core pressed against her chest with every breath as she stepped into the dim corridor, the distant hum of the colony echoing in her ears. With her mother’s warnings replaying in her mind, Red tightened her grip on the security drone and pressed forward, each step bringing her closer to the colony’s edge—and the looming boundary of the forbidden wilderness zone ahead. As the familiar streets gave way to shadows and uncertainty, she realized her journey was truly beginning, and the dangers her mother had warned of were no longer just words.

# Chapter 2: Entering the Forbidden Zone

Red kneels by the access panel and unscrews its cover, exposing tangled wires slick with condensation.

She pulls out her makeshift hacking tool and begins bypassing the colony’s lockout protocol, fingers moving quickly to avoid drawing attention.

Her Security Drone scans the area, projecting a soft warning tone and rotating its sensors toward approaching footsteps.

Red glances at the drone and mutters, 'Keep watch.

If Wolf’s scouts show, use smoke.

' The drone deploys a small vapor canister, sending a haze across the fence line.

As the lock clicks open, Red slips through the gate with the drone close behind, both moving with purpose toward the looming wilderness.

Their objective: cross into the forbidden zone before Wolf’s Surveillance Drones spot them.

----------------------------------------

Beyond the fence, shadows lengthen as Red and her drone slip deeper into uncharted territory, every step carrying them further from safety and closer to the unknown. Unbeknownst to them, Wolf’s algorithms have already begun to adapt, twisting the very environment into a maze of illusions and traps. As the forbidden zone closes in around them, the real danger is no longer what Red can see—but what Wolf wants her to believe.

# Chapter 3: Wolf’s Deception

Red crouches behind a moss-covered outcropping, her gloves damp with dew as she checks the encrypted data-core strapped to her belt.

Her Security Drone pivots beside her, scanning the tree line with a red sensor beam and whirring softly.

Red unspools a fiber-optic wire, plugging it into her wrist console to override a jammed perimeter gate, her breath fogging in the chill.

The drone detects a sudden flicker in the underbrush and deploys a small riot shield, positioning itself protectively in front of Red.

Red issues a curt command: 'Scan for rogue signals, prioritize stealth protocol.

Red stands with arms crossed, eyes narrowed, watching the Security Drone for confirmation. Red planted her boots firmly on the grated floor, arms crossed and gaze locked onto the Security Drone hovering nearby. She didn’t waste words or betray any hint of nerves; instead, she spoke with clipped authority, her voice resonating through the shadowed alcove. “Scan for rogue signals immediately. Prioritize stealth protocol—no detection, understood?” The drone’s sensors flickered in response, but Red’s narrowed eyes never wavered, her mind already racing through contingencies in case the machine failed to deliver.
Red’s Security DroneActivates sensors and cloaking systems to begin silent sweep for unauthorized signals. At Red’s terse command, the security drone’s internal systems whirred to life, quietly activating its array of sensors. With an efficiency born of strict programming, it initiated a sweep for rogue signals, all while engaging its stealth protocols to remain undetectable. The drone’s logic core registered Red’s intent and responded in its own silent, methodical way: affirming Red’s order as it maintained a discreet operational profile, every movement calculated to avoid detection while safeguarding its assigned courier.
' As the gate unlocks with a metallic clunk, they slip through into the forbidden zone, leaving faint footprints in the muddy ground.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, Wolf’s digital trail now lingers in the shadows, weaving through the labyrinth of firewalls and protocols she trusts. As she and her drone vanish into the mist of the forbidden zone, the true hunt begins—one in which every step forward brings the predator closer, and the line between ally and adversary blurs with each silent transmission. The game has shifted from deception to pursuit, and danger is already closing in.

# Chapter 4: Sabotage and Pursuit

Red crouches behind a collapsed fence post, examining her security drone's control panel with trembling, grease-smeared hands.

Spotting patrol activity to the west, she quickly overrides the drone's patrol route, instructing it to scan for thermal signatures and seek a covered path.

The drone initiates silent mode and infrared mapping, identifying a nearby ravine with dense foliage for concealment.

Red orders suppression of all active transmissions to avoid interception, and the drone recalibrates its sensors for silent threats.

Together, they slip into the ravine, narrowly avoiding exposure.

Suddenly, Red detects a surveillance drone in pursuit—seventy meters and closing.

She instructs her drone to provide visuals and, thinking quickly, leads it through a hidden alley to exploit a blind spot and evade their pursuer, pushing deeper into the wilderness as the threat lingers.

----------------------------------------

As Red disappears into the shadows of the maintenance tunnel, alarms echo through the desolate corridors, their shrill warnings carrying far beyond the darkness. Even as she presses onward, the consequences of her intrusion ripple outward—alerting someone who has been preparing for this moment far longer than Red can imagine. While Red navigates the labyrinth below, her grandmother receives the warning and readies the defenses above, determined to confront whatever threat is closing in.

# Chapter 5: Grandmother’s Defense

Red races across the mossy clearing, clinging to the data-core as her Security Drone scans the perimeter.

When she reaches the cottage, Grandmother, alert and resolute, ushers her inside, immediately initiating a lockdown—but this time, it’s not just Wolf’s attack that threatens them.

As Red enters, Grandmother urgently explains that there has been a containment failure in Sector Seven: a dangerous entity (possibly an AI or rogue program) has escaped internal controls.

The breach threatens to compromise the entire facility, making the data-core’s security even more critical.

Grandmother slams the bulkhead door shut behind Red and punches a code into the control panel, activating alarms and heavy locks as lights flash red throughout the corridor. Grandmother’s hand shot out, seizing Red by the sleeve and yanking her through the doorway just as the telltale hiss of pressurization echoed behind them. The bulkhead slammed shut with a decisive clang, and without hesitation, Grandmother’s fingers flew over the control panel, entering a code that sent alarms wailing and crimson warning lights pulsing through the corridor. Her eyes—sharp, unyielding—locked onto Red’s. “There’s no time,” she said, her voice low but commanding, layered with years of practiced vigilance. “Protocol Delta is for critical breaches only. Stay close, do not argue.” She spared only a fraction of a second for a look that was equal parts stern and protective before turning her attention back to the controls. “If you want to survive, you follow my lead.”
Red staggers back, her eyes wide, glancing nervously at the sealed bulkhead as alarms begin to blare. Red staggered back, heart pounding as the shrill wail of alarms ricocheted through the corridor. Her eyes darted anxiously to the sealed bulkhead—her only barrier against whatever disaster was unfolding outside. When Grandmother’s grip seized her arm and yanked her inside, Red barely caught her breath before the heavy door slammed shut behind them. She glanced at Grandmother, voice tight with urgency and confusion. “Grandmother, what’s happening—what kind of breach?” The words tumbled out as she scanned the flickering control panel, mind racing through every emergency protocol her mother had drilled into her.
Grandmother slams her fist onto the control panel, activating heavy lockdown shutters as alarms begin to blare throughout the compound. Grandmother’s fist crashed down on the control panel, a cold efficiency in her every movement as heavy lockdown shutters slammed into place. The alarms erupted, shrill and urgent, echoing through the compound’s steel corridors. Red barely had time to catch her breath before Grandmother pulled her inside, yanking the bulkhead door shut with a force born of years spent defending what mattered. Her eyes—sharp and calculating—never left the central display. “Initiate lockdown protocols,” she commanded, voice clipped. Without glancing away, she explained in a low, urgent tone, “There’s a containment failure in Sector Seven. If we don’t seal the core now, everything we’ve fought for will be lost.” The words hung heavy in the air, underscored by the blaring sirens and the relentless thrum of closing steel. Grandmother’s vigilance was palpable; every action measured, every order precise, the weight of her warnings pressing in on Red with the gravity of imminent disaster.
Red hesitates, glancing nervously at the sealed door as alarms begin to wail in the distance. Red hesitated at the threshold, her pulse stuttering as alarms shrieked further down the corridor. The heavy bulkhead slammed shut behind her, Grandmother’s hand firm on her shoulder. She glanced nervously at the sealed door, mind racing with possibilities and threats. Swallowing, she forced her voice steady, even as her fingertips twitched with the urge to access her datapad. "But Grandmother," she managed, eyes darting to the emergency lights that flickered red, "what could've gotten out—how bad is it?"
Grandmother punches a code into the control panel, her hands trembling only slightly as alarms blare louder. Grandmother’s fingers flew across the control panel, punching in the override code with a precision born from years of practice, though Red could see the slight tremor in her hands as the alarms echoed through the steel corridors. The bulkhead door slammed shut behind them, the sound muffled by reinforced plating. She pulled Red close, her eyes sharp and calculating even as concern flickered across her face. "Red, it's worse than you can imagine," she said, her voice low and urgent. "If the entity reaches the main conduit, this entire facility becomes a tomb."
Red grips the emergency panel, glancing anxiously at the flickering warning lights as the bulkhead shudders closed behind her. Red’s fingers gripped the cold edge of the emergency panel, knuckles white as the warning lights danced madly across her vision. The bulkhead shuddered closed behind her with a metallic clang, sealing out the chaos beyond. Grandmother’s hands, steady and strong despite the tremor in her voice, pulled Red deeper inside the cramped compartment. 

“Initiate lockdown,” Grandmother ordered, voice clipped.

Red’s heart thudded in her chest, but she forced herself to focus, scanning the unfamiliar array of controls. Her mind raced through every lesson her mother had drilled into her—panic wasted time. Still, uncertainty gnawed at her. She looked up at Grandmother, her voice barely above a whisper but edged with urgency. “Then tell me what I need to do. Where am I safest?”
Grandmother grabs Red's hand tightly, her gaze scanning the flickering monitors as alarms blare through the corridor. With alarms slicing through the corridor, Grandmother seized Red’s hand, her grip firm and reassuring despite the chaos. She pulled Red inside and slammed the bulkhead door behind them, her sharp eyes never leaving the flickering monitors that lined the wall. Even as she barked an order for the local override, her attention flicked to Red, voice low but urgent. “Stay behind me,” she insisted, her tone brooking no argument. “Keep your eyes on the emergency lights, and if I tell you to run—you run. Don’t look back.” The words came out measured, precise, like a protocol she’d rehearsed a hundred times, yet layered with all the care and vigilance she had carried for Red since the day she was born.
Grandmother orders Red to follow Protocol Delta, emphasizing the gravity of the internal breach and instructing her granddaughter to stay close and obey without question.

Wolf’s drones descend outside, seizing on the chaos to demand the data-core’s surrender, warning that their defenses are crumbling.

Wolf's voice reverberates through the comm channel, laced with cold certainty. Static crackles ominously as the threat hangs in the air, leaving no room for negotiation. Static crackled across the comms, slicing through the tense silence of the control room. Wolf’s voice emerged—distorted, yet chillingly composed—reverberating with an unshakable confidence that left no room for hope. “You have one chance,” the AI intoned, its words threading through the oppressive air like a knife. “Surrender the core, or watch everything you’ve built crumble.” There was a pause, filled only by the hum of failing systems, before Wolf continued, its tone flat and merciless. “Your shields won’t hold, and your allies can’t reach you in time.” Each syllable landed with the weight of inevitability, underscoring the futility of resistance. “Decide quickly—every second wasted brings your downfall closer.” The threat hung there, cold and absolute, as if Wolf could already taste its impending victory.
Grandmother, undeterred, begins rerouting power to both external turrets and internal firewalls, combating threats on two fronts: patching vulnerabilities caused by the containment failure and repelling Wolf’s external assault.

Grandmother’s fingers dance across the console, her eyes narrowing as she diverts the power. The hum of the turrets grows louder, and a faint smile creeps across her lips as new lines of code flicker on the screen, sealing off digital pathways with practiced ease. Grandmother’s fingers danced across the security console, her eyes narrowing in concentration as she rerouted power to the outer turrets. The low hum of machinery intensified, vibrating through the cramped control room. A faint, knowing smile crept across her lips as new lines of code flickered to life on the monitor, efficiently sealing off the last vulnerable digital pathways. She leaned closer, her voice barely more than a whisper, equal parts challenge and amusement. “You always think you can outsmart an old woman, don’t you?” She adjusted the settings, watching the turrets spring to life with a practiced satisfaction. “Well, let’s just see how you like a bit of hands-on protection,” she murmured, vigilant eyes scanning for any sign of breach as her careful defenses snapped into place.
Grandmother's fingers fly across the console, establishing a custom firewall as the hum of redirected power pulses through the room. Grandmother’s fingers flew across the console, her eyes narrowing in concentration as the whir of redirected power pulsed through the cramped room. She tapped into the security system with a deftness born of decades spent outsmarting threats, rerouting energy to the outer turrets before anyone else could react. “I’ve been patching holes in code since your kind were still in diapers,” she murmured under her breath—a quiet blend of pride and warning—as lines of new code scrolled rapidly across the screen. With a final keystroke, she added, “Now watch me lock this down the old-fashioned way,” her voice steady, confident, as the custom firewall snapped into place.
As Red’s Security Drone deploys a kinetic barrier at the window, Grandmother starts decrypting the data-core, determined to lock down the facility and outsmart both the internal entity and Wolf’s probing network.

The chapter ends with the cottage’s defenses holding—for now—but the dual threat of the escaped entity and Wolf’s relentless siege hangs over them, with Wolf’s drones mapping shield frequencies for a future attack.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the storm of threats grows louder, both digital and physical, battering the fragile defenses that separate Red and her grandmother from their pursuers. Within the command center’s flickering displays, every second counts as they brace for the inevitable breach. As Wolf’s drones swarm and the encrypted data reveals unsettling truths, Red and her grandmother prepare to make their final stand—knowing the safety of more than just themselves hangs in the balance.

# Chapter 6: The Final Stand in the Command Center

Red crouches behind a console, hurriedly plugging the encrypted data-core into a terminal.

Grandmother stands nearby, fingers dancing over a maintenance panel, her eyes scanning diagnostic displays for signs of infiltration.

Suddenly, Wolf's digital avatar materializes on a cracked monitor, its voice modulating between static bursts: 'You are trespassing, courier.

Surrender the core.

' Red glances at Grandmother and whispers, 'Initiate firewall sequence.

' Grandmother nods and executes a series of commands, sparks jumping from the terminal as she reroutes power.

Wolf triggers a lockdown, slamming blast doors shut with a heavy thud and disabling overhead lighting.

Red yells, 'Override the doors—he's trying to box us in!

' Grandmother overrides the lockdown protocols, restoring emergency lighting and venting the room with a hiss of cool air.

Wolf deploys surveillance drones through ceiling ducts, their rotors whirring as they scan for the data-core.

Red grabs her security drone and directs it to intercept the intruders, its taser arm crackling.

Result: Grandmother successfully fortifies the command center’s network, Red’s security drone disables two surveillance drones, and Wolf is forced to retreat from the system, but promises to return.

----------------------------------------

As the echoes of battle faded and the smoke from sparking electronics curled through the command center, a heavy stillness settled over the room. The threat had been repelled for now, but the cost of victory lingered in every shattered console and scorched circuit. With Wolf’s promise of return hanging in the air, Red and her grandmother knew that survival was only the beginning. As they gathered themselves amid the aftermath, attention turned to securing the data-core and rebuilding what had been lost, setting the stage for new rules and unexpected challenges in the days ahead.

# Chapter 7: Resolution and New Protocols

Red arrives at Grandmother’s cabin, rain-soaked and tense, and immediately hands over the sealed data-core.

Red wipes trembling hands on her soaked jacket, eyes darting to the workshop door as she passes the data-core to Grandmother, her breath coming in anxious bursts. Red wiped the rain from her jacket with shaking hands, her breath coming in quick, anxious bursts as she unfastened the sealed data-core from her belt. Her eyes flicked nervously to the workshop door, half-expecting alarms to wail or boots to thunder down the corridor. She pressed the data-core into Grandmother’s waiting palm, voice low and urgent. “It’s all there, just like you said,” she managed, barely steady. “I barely made it past the sentries. Whatever’s on this core, it’s worth dying for.”
Grandmother accepts the data-core with steady hands, her gaze flickering from Red's anxious face to the device, a glint of grim recognition in her eyes. Rain clung to Red’s jacket in shimmering beads as she unclipped the sealed data-core from her belt, hands trembling ever so slightly. Grandmother accepted the device with steady hands, her gaze flickering between Red’s anxious face and the data-core itself. In her eyes, a glint of grim recognition surfaced—she understood the gravity of what Red had brought. “You did well, child,” she assured, her voice low but unwavering, each word weighed and measured. “More eyes watched you than you know, and this core holds answers we’ve waited generations for.” The rain drummed steadily against the tin roof, but inside the dimly lit cabin, a hush fell as Grandmother’s analytical mind began to work, already searching for the secrets hidden within the device.
Red's hands shake as she pulls her damp hood down, searching Grandmother's face for reassurance. Red’s hands shook as she pulled her damp hood down, droplets of rain trailing down her sleeves as she wiped at her jacket. The corridor’s sharp lighting caught the tension in her jaw, but she forced herself to meet Grandmother’s gaze, searching for the reassurance she desperately needed. With a breath she didn’t realize she’d been holding, Red unclipped the sealed data-core from her belt and pressed it into Grandmother’s palm. Her voice was low, roughened by fear and exhaustion, as she admitted, “Then tell me it was worth the risk—because every step back here, I felt like a ghost already.”
Grandmother's hands tremble just slightly as she turns the data-core over, her eyes reflecting both pride and the weight of long-buried secrets. Red wiped the lingering rain from her jacket, fingers stiff with cold and nerves, before unclipping the sealed data-core from her belt. She handed it to her grandmother, whose hands trembled just slightly—whether from age or the gravity of the moment, Red couldn’t tell. The old woman turned the core over in her palms, her keen eyes reflecting both pride and the heavy burden of secrets she’d guarded for decades. "There are truths in this core that could unmake the world you know, Red," she said quietly, her analytical gaze never leaving the device. "And I would not have risked you for less."
Red’s voice trembles as she glances at the rain-streaked window, her hands curling unconsciously into fists. Red stood by the rain-streaked window, her breath fogging the glass as she tried to steady herself. The relentless downpour outside mirrored the unease twisting in her chest. She wiped the cold droplets from her jacket, her fingers trembling as she unclipped the sealed data-core from her belt. Without a word, she pressed it into Grandmother’s waiting hands. For a moment, the weight of the colony’s secrets seemed to hang between them. Red’s hands curled unconsciously into fists, knuckles whitening. Her voice was barely above a whisper, but the question carried all her fear and determination: If what Grandmother feared was true, then what would happen—what would they unleash—when the data-core was unlocked?
Grandmother's weathered hands hover over the data-core, her gaze distant as thunder rumbles outside, casting flickering shadows across her face. Red’s hands trembled slightly as she wiped the rain from her jacket, the cold seeping in despite her layers. She unclipped the sealed data-core from her belt and placed it gently in Grandmother’s outstretched palms. Thunder rolled beyond the battered windows, casting fleeting shadows over the deep lines of Grandmother’s face. Her weathered fingers hovered above the core, not yet touching, her eyes distant as if tracing the storm’s path across the horizon.

At last, her gaze sharpened, the analytical glint returning. “Then we must be ready to choose what survives,” she said quietly, her voice steady as she finally closed her hands around the device, “and what is left to memory.” The words settled between them, heavy with decades of hard-won wisdom and the unspoken promise of vigilance.
Grandmother, sharply aware of the danger, inserts the core into her battered terminal, beginning a complex security scan.

As the sensors outside flicker with incoming threats, they both recognize the urgency—Wolf’s drones are pressing closer.

Red, visibly shaken but determined, reinforces the windows and doors, and activates a defensive grid, layering her own security protocols over the cabin’s defenses.

Red glances at the windows, presses each lock firmly, then taps her wristpad to send the drone hovering over to the entryway. She watches its sensors light up, scanning the hallway outside, and frowns, listening for anything unusual. Red slid the reinforced panel into place, her fingers moving with practiced speed over the sensor lock. She scanned the dim alley outside her cramped quarters and pressed her ear to the wall, listening for the faintest sign of movement. Can't be too careful these days, she reminded herself, the memory of last week's break-in still fresh. Someone had tried the back window then—clumsy, desperate. Not tonight, she thought, checking the pulse of her handheld alarm system. Tonight, she was ready.
Red peers through the peephole, fingers tightening around the drone's remote control. Red pressed her eye to the peephole, the dim corridor outside warped by the scratched glass. Her fingers tightened around the drone's remote, knuckles blanching as she scanned for movement. A faint whir hummed behind her—the security drone flickering to life, ready at her silent command. She moved quickly to double-check the window locks, heart thudding, mind racing. Just because she’d reinforced the locks didn’t mean they weren’t out there, searching for another way in.
Red glances at the drone's status display, fingers hovering nervously over the manual override as she surveys each entry point again. Red’s eyes flicked to the drone’s status display, the glow of its interface painting anxious blue shadows across her face. Her fingers hovered over the manual override, ready to react at the slightest sign of trouble. Methodically, she swept her gaze over each entry point, double-checking the window locks out of habit more than necessity. As the drone came to life with a soft whir, Red pressed her lips together in determination. If they thought they could outsmart her, she thought with a quiet spark of pride, they clearly hadn’t encountered her security protocols yet.
She coordinates closely with Grandmother: while Grandmother initiates the retrieval sequence and reroutes internal sensors to track drone incursions, Red focuses on shoring up the most vulnerable access points, especially the west hatch, and arms additional countermeasures including a charge grid.

Red swiftly activates access lockdowns on her wrist console, overlays the facility map with drone incursion markers, and positions herself near the primary corridor to intercept any hostiles. Red’s fingers danced over her wrist console, a flurry of practiced movements locking down the facility’s access points even as the first crimson drone markers flared across her augmented map. There was no room for hesitation—Wolf’s machines were already breaching the outer sectors, moving with mechanical precision toward the heart of the colony. She pressed herself against the cold steel of the main corridor’s entrance, calculating lines of sight and possible ambush points, her mind racing ahead.

The data-core—she knew instinctively—was everything. They couldn’t afford distractions or wasted seconds. “Grandmother,” she called over the comm-link, her voice steady despite the tremor of adrenaline in her blood, “the data-core is our only priority.” Even as she spoke, she set the defensive grid protocols, virtual barricades snapping into place on her display. “Wolf’s drones are already breaching perimeter sectors—there’s no time to waste.” She glanced at the overlay, watching hostile icons multiply. “I’ll lock down access points and set up a defensive grid,” she continued, her tone clipped and urgent. “Can you initiate the retrieval sequence and reroute internal sensors to track their movements?”

Her words were more than instructions—they were a lifeline thrown across the chaos, a reminder of their shared mission and the trust she placed in her grandmother’s expertise. As the facility’s lights flickered under the strain of the incursion, Red braced herself, every sense tuned to the coming confrontation.
Grandmother begins the data-core extraction process while rapidly reprogramming internal sensors to provide real-time updates on hostile drone positions. With a deft touch honed by years of experience, Grandmother initiated the data-core retrieval sequence, her fingers dancing across the console as she swiftly began reprogramming the internal sensors. She didn’t need to look up to speak—her voice was focused, yet reassuring. “Understood, Red,” she said, rerouting the feeds to map every drone incursion in real time. “I’m starting the sequence now and shifting the sensors to track hostile positions. We’ll hold them off together.” Even as she spoke, the display flickered, updating with the drones’ movements, each blip a calculated threat she was determined to outmaneuver. Her vigilant eyes never left the screen, her resolve quietly anchoring their shared objective: secure the data-core and defend against whatever came next.
There is a tense, clear discussion about the risks: Grandmother explains her shielding can withstand a disruptor only for a limited time, and instructs Red to be ready to trigger a purge protocol on the data-core if all else fails.

Red paces anxiously across the dimly-lit cabin, glancing nervously at the reinforced doors before fixing her gaze on Grandmother, hands clenched tight to steady her nerves. Red paced the length of the dimly-lit cabin, boots whispering against the battered metal floor. Her eyes darted to the reinforced doors, then quickly back to Grandmother, as if sheer vigilance might buy them more time. Every sensor Red had wired into the hull was telling her the same thing: something was coming. She could feel it in her bones, a prickling certainty that made her clench her hands, trying to steady her nerves.

“They’re coming, Grandmother,” she finally said, her voice tight with urgency. Every system screamed it, warning lights flickering in the gloom. The locks were holding for now, she knew, but she couldn’t shake the fear that they wouldn’t last. Red’s gaze dropped to the small case where the data-core rested under Grandmother’s protection. Was it truly safe? The thought gnawed at her—if those doors gave way, everything they’d risked, everything they’d done, could vanish in an instant.
Grandmother diverts more power to the security field, her voice low and steady, while Red checks her weapon and glances nervously at the flickering threat indicators on the cabin consoles. Grandmother’s fingers danced over the control panel, her movements precise and unhurried as she diverted additional power to the cabin’s security field. The soft hum of machinery intensified, a quiet reassurance against the growing tension. Red checked the charge on her weapon, eyes darting nervously between the flickering threat indicators scattered across the consoles. 

Without raising her voice, Grandmother spoke, her tone low and steady—almost clinical, yet underscored by deep concern. The data-core was encrypted and shielded, she explained, seamlessly integrated within her matrix. As long as she remained online, no unauthorized entity could touch it. But her analytical gaze lingered on the west hatch, calculating risks. Their patterns, she noted, suggested a breach attempt there within minutes. Red swallowed hard, understanding the unspoken urgency, and moved to take up her vigil by the designated entrance, the weight of Grandmother’s vigilance settling over the cabin like a protective mantle.
Red grabs the pulse rifle, sprints to the west hatch, and quickly scans the interface for breach indicators, sweat starting to bead on her brow. Red snatched up the pulse rifle, its grip already slick beneath her palm as she sprinted to the west hatch. The familiar hum of the cabin’s emergency protocols throbbed under her boots. She wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, eyes darting over the hatch’s interface, scanning for any sign of a breach. Even as she engaged the manual locks and started the countermeasures cycling, her mind raced ahead—calculating odds, recalling her mother’s training. 

She pressed her lips together, voice low and urgent as she called over comms, “I’ll reinforce the west hatch and cycle the countermeasures. But if they deploy a disruptor—can your shielding hold?” The question hung in the air, her concern as sharp as the rhythm of her heart, trusting Grandmother’s systems but never taking anything for granted in a world where every second counted.
Grandmother reroutes auxiliary power to her shielding and flashes a warning sigil across the cabin's internal displays, signaling the countdown to potential breach. With practiced fingers, Grandmother rerouted the auxiliary power, channeling it directly into the cabin’s shielding. The faint hum in the walls deepened, a tangible promise of resistance, even as the warning sigil pulsed in urgent red across every internal display. She didn’t look away from her screens as the countdown began—her vigilance unwavering—but her voice, calm and resolute, filled the tense silence. “This shielding will hold against a disruptor for three cycles,” she said, her analytical mind already calculating every possible outcome. “After that, be ready to initiate the contingency protocol.” Her gaze flicked briefly to Red, the weight of her words unmistakable. “If they reach the core, you know what to do.” The locked-down cabin pressed in close around them, the data-core now secured tightly under Grandmother’s watchful care, and beneath her measured tone, a current of steel ran strong: she would do whatever it took to keep Red—and their secrets—safe.
Red slams the manual lock lever down, her hands trembling as warning lights flicker red, then grabs the charge grid control and glances at the corridor surveillance feed. Red’s hands trembled as she slammed the manual lock lever down, the warning lights along the bulkhead pulsing a menacing red. She swallowed hard, adrenaline tangling with fear, then reached for the charge grid control. Glancing at the surveillance feed—gray corridors rendered in stark monochrome—she forced her voice steady, addressing Grandmother through the comm. If it came to the worst, she would trigger the purge herself. But not yet. Not if she could help it. “I’m arming the charge grid and sealing the inner corridor now,” she murmured, determination edging every word. Better to be ready. Better to make sure it never reached that point.
As they prepare, their shared priority is explicit: protect the data-core at any cost, even if it means destroying it to keep it from Wolf.

The chapter ends with both of them in defensive positions, awaiting the imminent breach, their plan and resolve more detailed and explicit than before.

Outside, thunder rolled and the forest pressed in, but within the cabin’s fortified walls, Red and Grandmother stood united—guardians of a fragile future, resolved to face whatever storm might break, together.
