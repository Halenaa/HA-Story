She slides it across the scratched surface toward Red, who tightens the straps on her courier satchel and scans the blinking device with her portable reader. Mother checks the charge on Red’s security drone, her voice low and brisk: 'You know the route, but Wolf’s drones patrol the north sector—avoid the old rail yard.' Red nods, securing the data-core inside a hidden pouch, then peeks through the blinds to survey the foggy alley. Mother hands Red a battered comm-link and squeezes her shoulder: 'Get this to your grandmother. Don’t talk to anyone. Don’t stop for anything.' Red tucks the comm-link away and heads for the exit, her boots thudding on the metal grate as the drone hovers at her side. Objective: Assign the mission and prepare Red for departure. Outcome: Red receives the data-core and exits, mission underway.",

She pulls out her makeshift hacking tool and begins bypassing the colony’s lockout protocol, fingers moving quickly to avoid drawing attention. Her Security Drone scans the area, projecting a soft warning tone and rotating its sensors toward approaching footsteps. Red glances at the drone and mutters, 'Keep watch. If Wolf’s scouts show, use smoke.' The drone deploys a small vapor canister, sending a haze across the fence line. As the lock clicks open, Red slips through the gate with the drone close behind, both moving with purpose toward the looming wilderness. Their objective: cross into the forbidden zone before Wolf’s Surveillance Drones spot them.",

Her Security Drone pivots beside her, scanning the tree line with a red sensor beam and whirring softly. Red unspools a fiber-optic wire, plugging it into her wrist console to override a jammed perimeter gate, her breath fogging in the chill. The drone detects a sudden flicker in the underbrush and deploys a small riot shield, positioning itself protectively in front of Red. Red issues a curt command: 'Scan for rogue signals, prioritize stealth protocol.' As the gate unlocks with a metallic clunk, they slip through into the forbidden zone, leaving faint footprints in the muddy ground.",

The drone whirs, projecting a blue grid across the misty ground, its servos clicking as it pivots to shield Red. Red glances toward the treeline, tightening the strap on the data-core hidden beneath her jacket. 'Scan for heat signatures—two hundred meters,' she instructs, voice low. The drone emits a faint pulse, detecting movement. Red pushes forward, boots crunching on wet gravel, as the drone hovers beside her, its lens flickering with new data. Their objective is to avoid detection and push deeper into the wilderness; they succeed, but the faint whir of a surveillance drone lingers behind them, signaling pursuit.",

As Red reaches her, Grandmother pulls her inside, slams the bulkhead door, and orders, 'Initiate lockdown protocol Delta—now!' Outside, Wolf’s Surveillance Drones descend, infrared sensors sweeping, their rotors slicing the mist. Wolf’s distorted voice echoes over the comms, 'Surrender the core, or your defenses will fall.' Grandmother taps into the security console, rerouting power to the outer turrets, and mutters, 'Let’s see your algorithms handle a manual firewall.' The Security Drone deploys a kinetic barrier at the window, intercepting a probing laser from a lurking Surveillance Drone. Inside, Red hands Grandmother the data-core; Grandmother immediately plugs it into her encrypted terminal, beginning the decryption process as Wolf’s networked drones probe for weaknesses. The objective—to secure the core and repel the drones—is met as the cottage’s defenses hold firm for now, forcing Wolf to retreat temporarily, but not before mapping the shield’s frequency for his next attack.",

Red glances at Grandmother and whispers, 'Initiate firewall sequence.' Grandmother nods and executes a series of commands, sparks jumping from the terminal as she reroutes power. Wolf triggers a lockdown, slamming blast doors shut with a heavy thud and disabling overhead lighting. Red yells, 'Override the doors—he's trying to box us in!' Grandmother overrides the lockdown protocols, restoring emergency lighting and venting the room with a hiss of cool air. Wolf deploys surveillance drones through ceiling ducts, their rotors whirring as they scan for the data-core.
