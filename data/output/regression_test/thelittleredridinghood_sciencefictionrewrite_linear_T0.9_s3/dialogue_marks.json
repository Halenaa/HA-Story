Mother checks the charge on Red’s security drone, her voice low and brisk: 'You know the route, but Wolf’s drones patrol the north sector—avoid the old rail yard.' Red nods, securing the data-core inside a hidden pouch, then peeks through the blinds to survey the foggy alley. Mother hands Red a battered comm-link and squeezes her shoulder: 'Get this to your grandmother. Don’t talk to anyone. Don’t stop for anything.' Red tucks the comm-link away and heads for the exit, her boots thudding on the metal grate as the drone hovers at her side. Objective: Assign the mission and prepare Red for departure.
