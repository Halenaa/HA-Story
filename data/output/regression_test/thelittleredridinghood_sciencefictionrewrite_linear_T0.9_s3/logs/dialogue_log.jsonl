As Red enters, Grandmother urgently explains that there has been a containment failure in Sector Seven: a dangerous entity (possibly an AI or rogue program) has escaped internal controls. The breach threatens to compromise the entire facility, making the data-core’s security even more critical. Grandmother orders Red to follow Protocol Delta, emphasizing the gravity of the internal breach and instructing her granddaughter to stay close and obey without question. Wolf’s drones descend outside, seizing on the chaos to demand the data-core’s surrender, warning that their defenses are crumbling.
