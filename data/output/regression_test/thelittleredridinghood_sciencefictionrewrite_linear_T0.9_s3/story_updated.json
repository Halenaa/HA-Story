She places it on the table, sliding it toward Red, who tightens her courier satchel and scans the blinking device with her reader. Sensing the heightened danger, Mother repeatedly emphasizes the seriousness of the mission, her voice urgent and emotional. She warns Red that Wolf’s drones have doubled their patrols in the north sector, especially near the old rail yard, and insists Red avoid it at all costs. Mother checks the charge on Red’s security drone, then, with repeated pleas, instructs Red to not talk to anyone, to keep moving no matter what, and to promise that she will be careful and follow every instruction. Mother hands Red a battered comm-link, squeezing her shoulder tightly, making her desperation clear. Red, taking in her mother’s anxious insistence, secures the data-core and comm-link, peeks through the blinds, and heads for the exit with her drone at her side. Objective: Assign the mission and prepare Red for departure, with Mother’s heightened concern and repeated warnings setting a tense, emotional tone. Outcome: Red receives the data-core and exits, mission underway.",

The drone detects a sudden flicker in the underbrush and deploys a small riot shield, positioning itself protectively in front of Red.

Red orders suppression of all active transmissions to avoid interception, and the drone recalibrates its sensors for silent threats. Together, they slip into the ravine, narrowly avoiding exposure.

As Red enters, Grandmother urgently explains that there has been a containment failure in Sector Seven: a dangerous entity (possibly an AI or rogue program) has escaped internal controls. The breach threatens to compromise the entire facility, making the data-core’s security even more critical. Grandmother orders Red to follow Protocol Delta, emphasizing the gravity of the internal breach and instructing her granddaughter to stay close and obey without question. Wolf’s drones descend outside, seizing on the chaos to demand the data-core’s surrender, warning that their defenses are crumbling. Grandmother, undeterred, begins rerouting power to both external turrets and internal firewalls, combating threats on two fronts: patching vulnerabilities caused by the containment failure and repelling Wolf’s external assault. As Red’s Security Drone deploys a kinetic barrier at the window, Grandmother starts decrypting the data-core, determined to lock down the facility and outsmart both the internal entity and Wolf’s probing network. The chapter ends with the cottage’s defenses holding—for now—but the dual threat of the escaped entity and Wolf’s relentless siege hangs over them, with Wolf’s drones mapping shield frequencies for a future attack.",

Red, visibly shaken but determined, reinforces the windows and doors, and activates a defensive grid, layering her own security protocols over the cabin’s defenses. She coordinates closely with Grandmother: while Grandmother initiates the retrieval sequence and reroutes internal sensors to track drone incursions, Red focuses on shoring up the most vulnerable access points, especially the west hatch, and arms additional countermeasures including a charge grid. There is a tense, clear discussion about the risks: Grandmother explains her shielding can withstand a disruptor only for a limited time, and instructs Red to be ready to trigger a purge protocol on the data-core if all else fails. As they prepare, their shared priority is explicit: protect the data-core at any cost, even if it means destroying it to keep it from Wolf.
