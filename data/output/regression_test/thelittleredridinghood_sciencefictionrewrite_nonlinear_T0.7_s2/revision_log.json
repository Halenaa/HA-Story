There is no sign of surveillance feed disruption, AI malfunction, or Wolf's intrusion in this exchange, which contrasts with the original plot's sudden attack and AI sabotage.

Red is also more verbally compliant and respectful than the original plot’s more guarded demeanor. The plot is updated to reflect a brief, cooperative inspection process and a slightly more direct interaction, while maintaining character motivations and the narrative flow.",

This intensifies the conflict between Grandmother's protective instincts and Red's sense of duty. The updated plot reflects this by highlighting Grandmother's plea for Red to stay hidden and Red's refusal, maintaining character consistency and natural progression toward Red's determined action.",
