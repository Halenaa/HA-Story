She glances over her shoulder, scanning the shadowy dunes for movement. The air is sharp with ozone and the distant whir of servos. Suddenly, a heavy boot crunches on gravel behind her—Wolf, tall and broad-shouldered, steps from the gloom, face half-hidden beneath the visor of a battered security helmet. His synthetic voice emerges, clipped and official: 'You there, what’s your purpose at this facility?' Red straightens, keeping one hand tight on her satchel. She edges sideways, positioning herself between Wolf and the door. 'Just making a delivery,' she answers, her voice steady. Wolf advances, blocking the keypad with his body, scanning her with a handheld sensor. The device emits a sharp beep, and he narrows his eyes. Red’s other hand flicks a micro-jammer from her belt, thumbing the switch to disrupt the scanner’s signal. Wolf’s gaze sharpens, but he doesn’t move aside. The desert wind gusts, carrying the tang of oxidized metal and dust. Both remain locked in place, the bunker’s door hissing open behind Red as her bypass completes. Wolf reaches out, palm open, demanding, 'Show me your cargo authorization.' Red hesitates, then slips past him, ducking into the bunker’s dim corridor as alarms begin to pulse faintly in the distance, triggered by her override. The standoff ends with Red gaining entry—Wolf following, silent and relentless."}, "output": {"dialogue": []}}

Mother taps a sequence on her slate, unlocking the case, and reveals a vial of shimmering nanomedicine, then secures it again with a precise snap. She leans close, voice low: 'No diversions, Red. Straight to Outpost Eleven. Avoid Sector D—Wolf's drones are sweeping.' Red nods, adjusting her satchel and double-checking the charge on her prosthetic forearm. As a warning klaxon blares in the distance, Mother presses a comm bead into Red’s palm: 'For emergencies only.' Red tucks it away, her boots scraping against the dust-slick floor as she turns toward the mag-rail platform, the delivery case locked tight at her side. Mother watches her go, fingers tightening on the slate, already relaying security protocols to the nearby terminal."}, "output": {"dialogue": []}}
