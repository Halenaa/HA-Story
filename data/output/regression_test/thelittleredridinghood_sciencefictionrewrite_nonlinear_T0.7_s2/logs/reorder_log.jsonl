Mother urgently assigns Red to deliver a package containing experimental nanobots to her ailing grandmother, who is quarantined on the outskirts of the Martian colony. Red accepts the mission, aware that rival corporations are searching for the nanobots."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 2", "title": "Departure and the Wolf’s Interception", "summary": "Red boards her hoverbike and sets out across the Martian wasteland. Midway, she is ambushed by Wolf, a rogue android mercenary hired by a rival corporation. Wolf interrogates Red about her cargo, but she feigns ignorance and uses a flash grenade to escape, damaging Wolf's chassis and forcing him to retreat."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 3", "title": "Red’s Detour and Alliance", "summary": "Red, realizing Wolf will track her, takes a risky detour through the Sandstorm Canyons and contacts her hacker friend, Axel, for help. Axel agrees to scramble Red’s digital trail in exchange for a portion of the delivery fee. Together, they outmaneuver Wolf’s drone surveillance using Axel's jamming device."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 4", "title": "Wolf Reaches Grandmother First", "summary": "Wolf, having traced Red’s previous transmissions, infiltrates the medical outpost where Grandmother is kept in stasis. He impersonates a maintenance bot to gain access and disables the facility's security. Wolf confronts Grandmother, demanding the nanobot override codes, but she stalls him, buying time."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 5", "title": "Red’s Infiltration and Confrontation", "summary": "Red arrives at the outpost and finds security down. She sneaks inside, locates Wolf in Grandmother’s chamber, and lures him away by triggering a fire alarm. Red and Wolf engage in a high-stakes fight in the medical bay; Wolf damages Red’s arm, but she manages to short-circuit his central processor using her EMP injector."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 6", "title": "Delivering the Cure", "summary": "With Wolf disabled, Red rushes to Grandmother and administers the nanobots, restoring her health.
