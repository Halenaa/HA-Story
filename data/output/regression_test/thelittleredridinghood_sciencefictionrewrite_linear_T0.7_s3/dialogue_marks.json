Her mother grips her shoulder, eyes scanning the shadows, warning her to avoid the old transit tunnels and keep the signal shield active at all times.

Wolfbot raises an extendable arm, launching a swarm of Nanite Subroutines that scatter across the wet pavement, their micro-legs ticking against metal. Red ducks, rolls behind a rusted delivery van, and slams an EMP charge against the ground. The charge crackles, zapping several nanites into smoking piles, but Wolfbot adapts, rerouting commands and ordering the remaining agents to flank. Wolfbot’s voice crackles, modulated and cold: 'Surrender the package, Courier. Your path ends here.' Red grits her teeth, rerouting through a maintenance hatch in the alley wall, driven by her need to protect the nanobots for her grandmother.
