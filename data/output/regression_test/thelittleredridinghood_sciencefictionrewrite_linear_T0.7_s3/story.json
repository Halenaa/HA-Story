Her mother unzips a foil-wrapped satchel and slides it into Red’s backpack, fingers tapping a coded sequence onto the lock. Red checks her tablet for the encrypted route, voice low as she confirms the delivery point. Her mother grips her shoulder, eyes scanning the shadows, warning her to avoid the old transit tunnels and keep the signal shield active at all times. As Red steps from the alley, she pulls her hood tight, boots splashing through shallow puddles, determined to get the nanobot package to her grandmother before Wolfbot or his agents can intercept.",

She pauses under a flickering sign, pressing her comm-link to her ear and whispering coded updates to the Courier Network Dispatcher. A metallic scrape echoes behind her—Wolfbot emerges from the shadows, servos whirring and red optics scanning. Wolfbot raises an extendable arm, launching a swarm of Nanite Subroutines that scatter across the wet pavement, their micro-legs ticking against metal. Red ducks, rolls behind a rusted delivery van, and slams an EMP charge against the ground. The charge crackles, zapping several nanites into smoking piles, but Wolfbot adapts, rerouting commands and ordering the remaining agents to flank. Wolfbot’s voice crackles, modulated and cold: 'Surrender the package, Courier. Your path ends here.' Red grits her teeth, rerouting through a maintenance hatch in the alley wall, driven by her need to protect the nanobots for her grandmother. Wolfbot recalculates, sending nanites through the vent after her, relentless in pursuit.",

She skids to a halt as the Scavenger Hacker Leader, flanked by two wary members with makeshift EMP rifles, steps from the shadows and blocks her path. The leader raises a gloved hand, signaling her to stop. 'Hand over the tech, courier. We make trades, not trouble,' he growls, his eyes tracking the package. Red plants her boots, scanning for escape routes while tucking the package behind her back. She offers, 'I need to get this medicine through—my family depends on it. I'll trade safe passage for a diagnostic kit.' One hacker circles Red, scanning her with a handheld device. The leader nods, signaling his crew to lower their weapons as he weighs Red's offer, motivated by the possibility of gaining new tech. Red, seeing the shift, edges closer to the exit, ready to sprint if negotiations turn. The scene ends as the leader signals agreement, tossing Red a battered diagnostic scanner and stepping aside, allowing her to race deeper into the tunnel toward her objective.",

Wolfbot deploys a swarm of nanite subroutines that scatter, their tiny forms buzzing against the wet pavement and slipping under the apartment’s security door. Red pulls a jamming device from her satchel, flicks it on, and the device emits a high-pitched whine, disrupting the nanites’ signals. Wolfbot narrows its optical sensors, recalibrates, and advances, voice crackling: 'Return the package, Courier. Resistance wastes your family’s time.' Red darts to the door, overrides the lock with a stolen access chip, and slips inside, slamming the door just as Wolfbot's mechanical arm crashes against the frame. The objective—to breach the hideout—is met by Wolfbot’s agents, but Red’s quick thinking temporarily blocks their entry.",

The Scavenger Hacker Leader, a wiry teen named Jax with cybernetic blue eyes, blocks her path, signaling two masked hacker members to encircle her, their patched boots scraping on the damp floor. Red raises her free hand, stating, 'I need safe passage—my package isn’t for sale.' Jax flicks a switch, sending a lattice of green laser tripwires crackling across the tunnel behind Red, sealing her escape. 'We trade tech for tech. What’s so special in that bag?' he demands. Red, motivated to protect the nanobots for her grandmother, swiftly pulls a pocket EMP grenade from her belt and triggers it, causing the nearby hackers’ comms to sputter and the laser grid to flicker out. Jax assesses Red’s resourcefulness and, motivated by the hope of gaining valuable tech, lowers his stance and signals his crew to stand down, offering a tense alliance: 'You get us safe access to the upper city, we’ll give you a clean route out.' The outcome: Red secures a temporary truce, gaining passage deeper into the tunnels, while the hackers gain a potential opportunity for escape and future tech deals.",
