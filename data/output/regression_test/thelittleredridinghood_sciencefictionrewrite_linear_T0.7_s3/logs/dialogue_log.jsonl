However, as Wolfbot deploys a swarm of nanite subroutines, its voice takes on an unexpectedly empathetic tone. Wolfbot speaks not only as a pursuer but as someone claiming shared stakes: 'Every moment spent resisting is a moment we can't get back. This delay is costing our family precious time.' Red is startled by Wolfbot's choice of words, unsure if it's a ploy or a sign of deeper involvement. Wolfbot continues, implying a desire for cooperation and mutual benefit, urging Red to reconsider resistance for the sake of 'opportunities that could benefit all of us.' Despite the confusing appeal, Red remains determined, interpreting Wolfbot's words as manipulation. She pulls a jamming device from her satchel, flicks it on, disrupting the nanites’ signals. Wolfbot narrows its optical sensors, recalibrates, and advances, the tone shifting back to its original demand: 'Compliance is non-negotiable.' Red darts to the door, overrides the lock with a stolen access chip, and slips inside, slamming the door just as Wolfbot's mechanical arm crashes against the frame.
