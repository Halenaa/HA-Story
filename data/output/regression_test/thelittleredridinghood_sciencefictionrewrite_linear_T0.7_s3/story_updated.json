Her mother unzips a foil-wrapped satchel and slides it into Red’s backpack, fingers tapping a coded sequence onto the lock. Red checks her tablet for the encrypted route, voice low as she confirms the delivery point. Her mother grips her shoulder, eyes scanning the shadows, warning her to avoid the old transit tunnels and keep the signal shield active at all times. As Red steps from the alley, she pulls her hood tight, boots splashing through shallow puddles, determined to get the nanobot package to her grandmother before Wolfbot or his agents can intercept.",

She pauses under a flickering sign, pressing her comm-link to her ear and whispering coded updates to the Courier Network Dispatcher. A metallic scrape echoes behind her—Wolfbot emerges from the shadows, servos whirring and red optics scanning. Wolfbot raises an extendable arm, launching a swarm of Nanite Subroutines that scatter across the wet pavement, their micro-legs ticking against metal. Red ducks, rolls behind a rusted delivery van, and slams an EMP charge against the ground. The charge crackles, zapping several nanites into smoking piles, but Wolfbot adapts, rerouting commands and ordering the remaining agents to flank. Wolfbot’s voice crackles, modulated and cold: 'Surrender the package, Courier. Your path ends here.' Red grits her teeth, rerouting through a maintenance hatch in the alley wall, driven by her need to protect the nanobots for her grandmother. Wolfbot recalculates, sending nanites through the vent after her, relentless in pursuit.",

She skids to a halt as the Scavenger Hacker Leader, flanked by two wary members with makeshift EMP rifles, steps from the shadows and blocks her path. The leader raises a gloved hand, signaling her to stop, and demands the tech, reminding Red of his reputation and capabilities. He clarifies that his group seeks a fair exchange, wanting to see what Red is carrying before negotiating further. Red, desperate and emotional, pleads for understanding, explaining her family's dire need—especially her little brother's deteriorating health—and insists that she cannot be delayed. She offers a deal: if the hackers provide her with an intact diagnostic kit, she will guarantee their safe passage through this sector; otherwise, she refuses to negotiate further due to time constraints. Moved by her determination and realizing the potential value of her offer, the leader signals his crew to lower their weapons. He tosses Red a battered but functional diagnostic scanner, stepping aside to allow her through. Red grasps the scanner and races deeper into the tunnel toward her objective.",

She scans the alley's shadows, her breath visible in the cold, damp air as she edges toward the service entrance. Wolfbot emerges from the darkness, metallic limbs glinting under flickering neon. However, as Wolfbot deploys a swarm of nanite subroutines, its voice takes on an unexpectedly empathetic tone. Wolfbot speaks not only as a pursuer but as someone claiming shared stakes: 'Every moment spent resisting is a moment we can't get back. This delay is costing our family precious time.' Red is startled by Wolfbot's choice of words, unsure if it's a ploy or a sign of deeper involvement. Wolfbot continues, implying a desire for cooperation and mutual benefit, urging Red to reconsider resistance for the sake of 'opportunities that could benefit all of us.' Despite the confusing appeal, Red remains determined, interpreting Wolfbot's words as manipulation. She pulls a jamming device from her satchel, flicks it on, disrupting the nanites’ signals. Wolfbot narrows its optical sensors, recalibrates, and advances, the tone shifting back to its original demand: 'Compliance is non-negotiable.' Red darts to the door, overrides the lock with a stolen access chip, and slips inside, slamming the door just as Wolfbot's mechanical arm crashes against the frame. The objective—to breach the hideout—is met by Wolfbot’s agents, but Red’s quick thinking temporarily blocks their entry. The encounter leaves Red uneasy, questioning Wolfbot's motives and whether there are deeper connections at play.",

Red raises her free hand, stating, 'I need safe passage—my package isn’t for sale.' Jax engages her in negotiation, emphasizing the hacker group's philosophy of mutual exchange and the high stakes surrounding Red's package, pressing her to consider what she is willing to do to protect it. Jax offers a tense alliance: 'You crack us a way past the upper city’s sweeper drones, we’ll make sure your exit stays squeaky clean. No alarms, no tail, no double-cross—if you hold up your end.' Red, motivated to protect the nanobots for her grandmother, agrees to the deal—leveraging her skills rather than force to secure safe passage.
