Identify yourself.') to a more direct, personal confrontation, with Wolf proactively addressing Red and offering his name.

The dialogue also gives Wolf more self-doubt and wariness than the original plot, but does not contradict his actions or core motivation. Red’s threat is consistent with her protective stance. Therefore, the plot is updated to highlight Wolf’s internal conflict and sense of high personal stakes, which aligns with the provided dialogue.",

Red does not feign a cough or immediately scan the impostor but instead uses conversation and logic to test the impostor before planning her escape. The plot is updated to reflect a more gradual escalation of suspicion and tension, with Red’s internal monologue and tactical planning shown in her spoken lines, rather than covert scanning. Wolf’s reveal is delayed until after Red’s suspicions peak and she begins to act on her doubts.",
