        "narrative_role": "Inciting In Media Res Conflict",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open with third person limited perspective centered on Red, present tense for immediacy. Introduce Red and Wolf during a tense standoff in the Quarantine Zone, but ensure that their interactions reflect unfamiliarity—neither recognizes the other from previous events. Withhold detailed backstory, instead focusing on the immediate stakes and atmosphere. Use subtle cues (Red’s internal thoughts, Wolf’s mechanical behaviors) to hint at their motivations without full exposition.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin abruptly with sensory details and tension, then, at the end of the chapter, let Red’s internal focus settle on what led her to this moment, signaling a narrative shift into the past."
