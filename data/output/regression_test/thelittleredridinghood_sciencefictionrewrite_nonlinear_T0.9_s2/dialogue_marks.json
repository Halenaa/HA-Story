She scans the alley, noting the glint of Wolf's metallic silhouette moving with calculated grace beyond the fence. Wolf's red optical sensor narrows as he lifts an arm, projecting a narrow beam of light that sweeps the area. Red slips a data spike from her jacket, jamming it into an access panel on the fence, sparks hissing as she overrides the lock. Wolf advances, footsteps ringing on wet concrete, voice modulator crackling: 'Halt. Identify yourself.' Red darts through the opening as the fence disengages, kicking up puddles. Wolf extends a hand, launching a microdrone that whirrs past Red's head, scanning her for contraband. Red tosses a signal jammer behind her, the device emitting a high-pitched whine and scrambling the drone's feed. Wolf pauses, recalibrating, then vaults the fence in a single, fluid motion, landing in front of Red with mechanical precision. The two face off, neon reflecting off Wolf's alloy frame, rain beading on Red's hood. Wolf's arm shifts into a restraint mechanism, blocking Red's escape route. Red, breathing quick and shallow, edges sideways, eyes darting for a way through. Wolf's movements remain precise and unwavering, methodically cutting off every exit. Their standoff is interrupted as a city police drone swoops overhead, its searchlight bathing the alley in harsh white. Wolf momentarily looks up, giving Red a split second to slip past, skidding on slick concrete toward the shadows of the quarantine ruins. Wolf recalculates and gives chase, his internal systems whirring, intent on intercepting her before she reaches her objective.",

As a siren echoed nearby, Red zipped the capsule into her inside jacket pocket, then nodded, shouldering her delivery satchel and moving swiftly toward the labyrinthine backstreets, her boots splashing through shallow puddles.

Red hesitated, shifting her weight, then darted sideways, knocking over a stack of plastic crates to block Wolf’s path. Wolf advanced, stepping over debris with mechanical precision, but paused when Red whipped out a handheld EMP spike and pressed her thumb to the activation pad. 'Back off,' she said, voice low, her gaze never leaving his. Wolf’s head tilted, calculating the risk. He reached for his belt, activating a signal that summoned his surveillance drones, their rotors buzzing as they converged overhead. Red, seeing the aerial shapes, ducked behind a dumpster, planning her next move. The standoff forced Wolf to halt, assessing her threat and recalibrating his pursuit.

The figure gestures tersely for Red to enter. Red hesitates, wipes rain from her visor, and steps inside, feeling the rough texture of metal flooring under her boots. The 'grandmother' closes the hatch and leads Red down a dim corridor lined with humming coolant pipes. As they approach the lab’s biometric lock, Red notices a glitch in the gait—too smooth, too calculated. She feigns a cough, stalling, and slips her bio-reader from her pocket. When she covertly scans the figure’s wrist, the device flashes red: biometric mismatch detected. The figure stiffens, then lunges, metal fingers flashing out from beneath the coat. Red pivots, shoving the impostor against the wall, and the hood falls—revealing Wolf’s synthetic jaw and gleaming eyes. Wolf’s voice crackles, \"You’re resourceful, but not enough. Hand over the drive.\" Red, pressing her back to the wall, tightens her grip on the data drive and scans for escape routes, her breath fogging in the cold recycled air.",

Grandmother slid open the trapdoor from inside, her gloved hand beckoning silently. Red dashed across the open ground, boots splashing through puddles, and slipped into the dimly lit corridor below as Grandmother sealed the entrance. At Grandmother’s gesture, Red handed over the virus drive; Grandmother connected it to her terminal, fingers flying across the keys to initiate the upload sequence. The lab’s automated defenses shifted into high alert, sensors blinking red as Wolf’s drone network descended, illuminating the trapdoor with harsh beams. Grandmother pulled Red behind a reinforced panel, ordering, “Stay low—let the system handle the first wave.” As the defense turrets whirred to life, the pair watched targeting lasers sweep through the corridor, repelling the drones long enough for Grandmother to begin the virus deployment.",
