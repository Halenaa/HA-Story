Wolf's tone is direct and threatening, underscoring his relentless nature. As Red prepares her data spike to override the lock, Wolf continues, introducing himself: 'Call me Wolf. I don't answer to many, and I don't come here without reason. If you've heard my name before, you know I'm not one to waste words—or time. Now, you asked who I am. Maybe the better question is: are you ready for the answer?' Red jams the spike into the access panel, causing sparks to hiss as she overrides the lock. Wolf advances, launching a microdrone to scan her for contraband. Red throws a signal jammer, scrambling the drone's feed. Wolf pauses to recalibrate, then vaults the fence, landing with mechanical precision and blocking Red's escape. They face off, neon reflecting on Wolf's frame. Red's breathing quickens as she looks for an exit, but Wolf methodically blocks her path. Suddenly, a city police drone swoops overhead, its searchlight illuminating the alley.

He eyed the battered package, recognizing its significance: inside were the codes, the ledger, and the leverage he believed could change the course of their conflict. Wolf’s internal monologue flickered with doubt and determination—if anyone else discovered the contents, it could spell disaster for all involved. He resolved to make no mistakes.
