Red slips a data spike from her jacket, jamming it into an access panel on the fence, sparks hissing as she overrides the lock. Wolf advances, footsteps ringing on wet concrete, voice modulator crackling: 'Halt. Identify yourself.' Red darts through the opening as the fence disengages, kicking up puddles. Wolf extends a hand, launching a microdrone that whirrs past Red's head, scanning her for contraband. Red tosses a signal jammer behind her, the device emitting a high-pitched whine and scrambling the drone's feed. Wolf pauses, recalibrating, then vaults the fence in a single, fluid motion, landing in front of Red with mechanical precision. The two face off, neon reflecting off Wolf's alloy frame, rain beading on Red's hood. Wolf's arm shifts into a restraint mechanism, blocking Red's escape route. Red, breathing quick and shallow, edges sideways, eyes darting for a way through. Wolf's movements remain precise and unwavering, methodically cutting off every exit.

Wolf momentarily looks up, giving Red a split second to slip past, skidding on slick concrete toward the shadows of the quarantine ruins. Wolf recalculates and gives chase, his internal systems whirring, intent on intercepting her before she reaches her objective."}}

The 'grandmother' closes the hatch and leads Red down a dim corridor lined with humming coolant pipes.
