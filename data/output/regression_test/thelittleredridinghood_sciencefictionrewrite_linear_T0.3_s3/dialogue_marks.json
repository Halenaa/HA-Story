Dr. Weaver opens it, glancing over her shoulder before ushering Red inside. He pulls a sealed nano-insulated case from beneath a false floor panel, the cool container emitting faint blue light. Weaver speaks in clipped, urgent tones, warning Red of Wolfbot's heightened patrols and the Cybershark Gang's new presence on delivery routes. Red nods, secures the case in her courier vest, and runs a quick scan with her wristpad to verify integrity. Weaver hands over a data chip, instructing her to deliver both the nanomedicine and the chip to Grandma's colony before sunset. Red double-checks the alley for drones, then slips into the shadowy city streets, blending into the shifting crowds as Weaver locks the door behind her.",

Red freezes for a split-second, then bolts for the security barrier, vaulting over a low fence as Wolfbot’s footsteps clang across the wet pavement.
