Weaver, in clipped, urgent tones, warns Red that Wolfbot's patrols have doubled and the Cybershark Gang is now muscling in on the west delivery routes, specifically mentioning that the gang is equipped with EMP nets capable of disabling Red’s gear. Red asks if the gang is cooperating with Wolfbot; Weaver confirms they are not, but notes both threats are operating independently. Red considers rerouting through Sector 9, but Weaver advises against it due to Wolfbot's infrared sweeps there, instead recommending the east tunnels and urging Red to keep communications silent and move quickly, warning of active scavengers. Weaver hands over both the nanomedicine and a critical data chip, explaining the chip is necessary for Grandma's colony to use the medicine correctly and stressing the urgency of delivering both before sunset to avoid putting the entire colony at risk.

Red, exasperated and focused on her urgent mission, tries to avoid delays but paradoxically insists on following protocol, emphasizing the importance of proper procedure for safety and accountability, despite her personal frustration. Suddenly, Wolfbot projects Grandma’s voice, pleading for help and trying to emotionally manipulate Red into compliance. The tense standoff escalates, with Red torn between her sense of duty and her desperation to deliver the life-saving supplies. The checkpoint alarms blare as Wolfbot signals city enforcers, but the contradictory motivations—Red enforcing protocol under duress, Wolfbot masquerading as a legitimate courier—create confusion at the gate, drawing additional scrutiny from security and delaying both parties.
