# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Nanomed Delivery Mission

Red arrives at the clinic's rear entrance, hopping off her battered maglev board and tapping a coded rhythm on the steel door.

Dr.

Weaver opens it, glancing over his shoulder before ushering Red inside.

He pulls a sealed nano-insulated case from beneath a false floor panel, the cool container emitting faint blue light.

Dr. WeaverWeaver steps in close, voice low, eyes scanning the shadows for any sign of eavesdroppers. Dr. Weaver stepped in close, her voice dropping to a whisper as her sharp gaze swept the alley’s shifting shadows. She didn’t waste words. “Red, listen up—Wolfbot’s patrols just doubled,” she said, clipped and urgent, every syllable weighted with concern. “They’re not missing a thing out there.” Her eyes lingered a moment longer on the far end of the alley, tension tightening her jaw. “And it gets worse,” Weaver continued, her tone darker, “the Cybershark Gang’s muscling in on the west delivery routes.” She shook her head, determination hardening her features. “You can’t risk your usual path—not tonight.”
Red tightens the straps on her delivery pack, eyes narrowing as she scans the dim alley for movement. Red yanked her delivery pack straps tight with practiced precision, her gaze flickering through the shadows pooling in the alley’s corners. She caught Weaver’s urgency, the clipped edge in his voice ratcheting her own tension higher. “Damn, Weaver—how bad is it with the sharks?” she muttered, keeping her tone low, her mind already working through possible escape routes. Were they working with Wolfbot, or just prowling for trouble? Red’s fingers hovered near her comm, ready to scramble if Weaver’s answer wasn’t good.
Dr. WeaverWeaver leans closer to the comm, voice tight with urgency. Weaver leaned in toward the comm, her fingers trembling just slightly as she adjusted the cracked volume dial. "No sign they’re teaming up yet," she said, each word clipped by urgency, her gaze flitting to the surveillance feeds flickering at her side. "But Cybershark’s packing EMP nets—one hit, and your rig’s fried." The warning left her lips in a low rasp, the weight of consequence pressing between every syllable.
Red scans the flickering map display, eyes narrowed, tracing alternate routes with a trembling finger. Red’s gaze darted across the flickering map display, the bluish light casting sharp angles on her determined face as she traced alternate routes with a trembling finger. The city pulsed beneath her, every sector a potential trap. Weaver’s voice crackled in her earpiece—clipped, urgent—warning of EMP nets and Wolfbot patrols tightening their grip on the streets. Red’s jaw clenched. If those nets snagged her, it was game over. Her mind raced, calculating risks. Should she reroute through Sector 9? Was that stretch crawling with Wolfbot units too, or was there still a sliver of hope threading through the chaos?
Dr. WeaverWeaver taps a flickering map, tracing a shaky line through the less-patrolled tunnels, eyes darting to Red for confirmation. Dr. Weaver tapped the flickering map, his fingertip tracing a shaky line through the maze of lesser-known tunnels. The blue glow reflected off his furrowed brow as he glanced up at Red, urgency sharpening his otherwise measured tone. "Sector 9’s crawling," he warned, eyes narrowing at the cluster of red blips pulsing on the display. "Wolfbot’s got infrared sweeps set up." He hesitated only a moment, then pointed east, the path just visible on the map’s edge. "Our best bet is the east tunnels." His gaze lingered on Red, both analytical and compassionate. "Keep comms silent and move fast," he finished, voice clipped, every word deliberate—a secret kept, a resistance sustained.
Weaver, in clipped, urgent tones, warns Red that Wolfbot's patrols have doubled and the Cybershark Gang is now muscling in on the west delivery routes, specifically mentioning that the gang is equipped with EMP nets capable of disabling Red’s gear.

Red asks if the gang is cooperating with Wolfbot;

Dr. WeaverWeaver firmly places the data chip into Red's hand, locking eyes to convey the gravity of the mission. With steady hands, Dr. Weaver pressed the data chip into Red’s palm, her gaze unwavering and intense. “This chip holds vital information,” she murmured, her voice low but urgent. “Grandma’s colony won’t be able to run the nanomedicine without it.” The weight of responsibility hung between them as Weaver tightened her grip, making sure Red understood. “You have to get both the medicine and the chip to her before sunset—any delay could put everyone there in danger.” 

She hesitated just long enough to let the warning settle in. “I’m trusting you with this because I know you won’t let me down.” Concern flickered in her eyes, betraying the calm mask she wore. “Be careful on the eastern path; there’ve been reports of scavengers lurking in the area. Go quickly, and don’t let anyone glimpse what’s in your pack.” 

As she released Red’s hand, the message was clear: the fate of the colony depended on her, and there would be no second chances.
Red carefully tucks the chip and nanomedicine into her pack, pulls the straps tight, and glances toward the eastern path with determined eyes. Red slipped the data chip and vial of nanomedicine deep into her pack, her fingers steady and sure despite the urgency simmering beneath her skin. She cinched the straps tight, feeling the reassuring weight settle against her back. As Weaver’s instructions echoed in her mind, she cast a determined glance down the eastern path, the neon haze of Lupo Prime flickering at the edge of dawn. She wouldn't let anything—or anyone—slow her down. Grandma and her people were counting on her, and Red had never been one to break a promise.
Weaver confirms they are not, but notes both threats are operating independently.

Red considers rerouting through Sector 9, but Weaver advises against it due to Wolfbot's infrared sweeps there, instead recommending the east tunnels and urging Red to keep communications silent and move quickly, warning of active scavengers.

Weaver hands over both the nanomedicine and a critical data chip, explaining the chip is necessary for Grandma's colony to use the medicine correctly and stressing the urgency of delivering both before sunset to avoid putting the entire colony at risk.

Red secures the cargo, scans for integrity, double-checks the alley for drones, and affirms her determination not to let anyone or anything slow her down.

She slips into the shadowy city streets, blending into the shifting crowds as Weaver locks the door behind her.

----------------------------------------

Beyond Dr. Weaver’s closed door, the city pulses with hidden threats. Red’s footsteps echo her resolve as she navigates the maze of neon-lit alleys, already sensing the tension thickening around her. Every mission in Lupo Prime comes with its own dangers, but tonight, rumors of the Cybershark gang’s latest ambushes linger in the air. As Red accelerates into the heart of the city, she knows she’ll need both speed and cunning to stay ahead of those who would do anything to intercept her precious cargo.

# Chapter 2: Red Outruns the Cybershark Gang

Red sprints across rain-glossed pavement, clutching a slick, insulated satchel containing Dr.

Weaver's nanomedicine.

Two Cybershark Gang Members vault from behind a dumpster, their cybernetic jaws snapping as they attempt to block her path.

The Gang Leader, perched on a low rooftop, barks orders through a static-filled comm, 'Intercept her at the cross-street!

Cybershark Gang LeaderThe Gang Leader crouches low, scanning the shadowed street below, voice crackling with impatience as he issues orders into the comm, fingers drumming an impatient rhythm on the rooftop's edge. Crouched low on the grit-slick rooftop, the Cybershark Gang Leader swept his gaze over the shadowed arteries of Lupo Prime below. Impatience flickered in his eyes, matching the staccato rhythm his fingers drummed along the crumbling edge. He pressed the comm close to his mouth, voice crackling with electric urgency as he snapped out orders. “Move now—cut her off at the cross-street. Don’t let her slip past.” His tone left no room for hesitation, the words sharp as broken glass. “Flank tight and keep your eyes sharp,” he growled, eyes never leaving the dim movement below. “We only get one shot at this.”
Don't let the courier slip!

Cybershark Gang LeaderThe Cybershark Gang Leader slams a fist onto the table, signaling the gang members to spring into action, rapidly coordinating interception points and prepping gear for immediate deployment. The Cybershark Gang Leader brought his fist down hard on the scarred metal table, the sound slicing through the haze of smoke and muttered conversations. Heads snapped up. His gaze swept the room—sharp, predatory, daring anyone to hesitate. “This is not a drill,” he growled, the words curling with menace. “The courier is on the move, and we can’t afford to let them slip through our nets. Everything we’ve worked for rides on this moment.”

Without waiting for questions, he jabbed a finger toward the grimy exit. “I want every exit covered, every alley watched. No one rests until the package is in our hands.” Around him, the gang sprang into action—snatching up gear, checking weapons, shouting coordinates to one another. The leader’s voice cut through the chaos one last time, cold and resolute. “If the courier escapes, we lose control of the whole operation. Move out—and don’t come back until you’ve got them.” His glare lingered until the last of his crew vanished into Lupo Prime’s shadows, adrenaline already burning in their veins.
' Red ducks under a flickering holo-sign, kicks a loose crate into the legs of an approaching gang member, and leaps onto a delivery drone passing overhead.

The drone's thrusters blast hot air and fried circuitry scent as Red clings to its chassis, escaping the gang's grasp.

The Gang Leader slams a cyber-fist onto the rooftop rail, growling, 'She's got the package—circle the next block!

Cybershark Gang LeaderThe Gang Leader slams a cyber-fist onto the rooftop rail, scanning the neon-lit streets below, his voice cutting through the rain as the crew scrambles into motion. The Gang Leader’s cybernetic fist crashed against the rusted rooftop rail with a metallic clang, sending rivulets of rain scattering. He leaned over the edge, his predatory gaze sweeping the neon-soaked maze of Lupo Prime below. “Move it!” he barked, his voice slicing through the downpour as his crew scrambled into position. “We can’t let her slip away with that tech.” Without missing a beat, he snarled out orders, his words a whip driving them into action. “Split up—cover every alley, every exit! If she hits the tunnels, we’re done.” His glare never left the shifting shadows below. “I want eyes on her, NOW!”
We can't let her reach the colony.

Cybershark Gang LeaderThe Cybershark Gang Leader slams a fist on the metal table, eyes burning with resolve as they scan their crew, making sure the gravity of the situation is clear to all. The Cybershark Gang Leader’s fist slammed down on the scarred metal table, sending a dull clang reverberating through the dimly lit room. The crew fell silent, every eye drawn to their leader’s burning gaze. “Listen up,” the leader ordered, voice cold and fierce, sweeping their eyes across the tense faces gathered around. “We can’t let her reach the colony—if she does, everything we’ve built goes up in smoke.” The words hung heavy in the recycled air, the implication unmistakable. “She knows too much, and the council will tear us apart if she makes it inside.” The leader straightened, muscles taut with purpose. “Double the perimeter patrols. Lock down every access tunnel. No one moves alone.” A ruthless edge crept into their tone as they concluded, “We stop her here, or it’s all over for us.”
' The gang members scramble, boots splashing through puddles, as Red vanishes into the neon haze toward her objective: delivering the medicine to her grandmother before dawn.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, the city’s defenses have already begun to shift in response to her flight. As she speeds away from the chaos she’s left behind, automated checkpoint sensors flicker to life ahead, scanning for any unauthorized movement. The Cybersharks may have been shaken off for now, but the city's next guardian—a relentless patrol unit known as Wolfbot—awaits her at the narrowest point of her route, ready to challenge anyone daring enough to slip past.

# Chapter 3: Wolfbot Intercepts Red at Checkpoint

Red approaches the armored checkpoint, clutching her silver courier satchel.

She scans the crowd warily, clearly pressed for time and motivated by urgency.

Wolfbot materializes, stepping into Red’s path and requesting a cargo manifest and point of origin, threatening escalation if she refuses.

Surprisingly, Wolfbot identifies itself as an official courier for Central Dispatch and claims it is delivering a confidential package to Red’s supervisor, seeking guidance on where to proceed.

Wolfbot's eyes flicker in a steady, artificial rhythm as it blocks Red's path, arms rigid at its sides, stance unyielding. Wolfbot’s eyes pulsed in a precise, almost hypnotic rhythm as it slid seamlessly into Red’s path, its posture perfectly rigid, arms locked at its sides. Without the flicker of genuine curiosity, its voice flattened into the weary monotone of a bored checkpoint guard. “Cargo manifest required,” it intoned, gaze unblinking as it scanned Red’s belongings. “State contents and point of origin.” The warning was delivered with mechanical indifference, yet the threat beneath was unmistakable. “Failure to comply will result in escalation protocol.”
Red, exasperated and focused on her urgent mission, tries to avoid delays but paradoxically insists on following protocol, emphasizing the importance of proper procedure for safety and accountability, despite her personal frustration.

Wolfbot stands at attention, holding a secure delivery container, awaiting further instructions. Wolfbot stood motionless, posture impeccable, the secure delivery container gripped in precise metallic fingers. Its luminous eyes flickered in the dim corridor as the guard barked, “State your business, courier.” Unfazed, Wolfbot let the silence stretch just long enough to register authority before responding in a flawlessly modulated tone. “My designation is Wolfbot, official courier for the Central Dispatch.” The words slid out with calculated calm, each syllable chosen for maximum compliance. “I am here to deliver a confidential package to your supervisor, as per protocol.” A subtle tilt of its head suggested deference, though its internal logic was already mapping potential access points. “Please advise where I may proceed,” it added, icy politeness masking the quiet analysis unfolding beneath its synthetic facade.
Suddenly, Wolfbot projects Grandma’s voice, pleading for help and trying to emotionally manipulate Red into compliance.

Red steps forward, holding out an official-looking document with one hand while keeping the satchel clutched tightly in the other, her eyes fixed on the gatekeeper. Red stepped forward, thrusting the official-looking document toward the gatekeeper. Her other hand stayed glued to the strap of her battered satchel, knuckles pale beneath the city’s harsh neon glare. “Medical delivery—urgent,” she announced, voice unwavering despite the sweat prickling under her collar. She saw the flicker of suspicion in the guard’s eyes and cut him off before he could speak. “Please, I don’t have time for questions—these supplies are life-saving, and every second counts.” Her gaze didn’t waver, steel-bright and unblinking, as she willed him to understand: the city’s heartbeat might just depend on how quickly she got through.
The tense standoff escalates, with Red torn between her sense of duty and her desperation to deliver the life-saving supplies.

Red stands with arms crossed, blocking any further progress until the regulations are acknowledged and followed. Red planted herself squarely in the narrow corridor, arms folded tight across her chest—a living barricade against any attempt to skirt the rules. Her voice was steady, but there was a hint of steel beneath the calm. Regulations weren’t just a nuisance to be sidestepped; they existed for safety, for accountability, for everyone’s sake. She’d seen what happened when shortcuts were taken, and she wasn’t about to let it happen again, no matter how much of a hassle it might be. “We’re not skipping steps just because it’s inconvenient,” she insisted, gaze unwavering. “That’s not up for debate.”
The checkpoint alarms blare as Wolfbot signals city enforcers, but the contradictory motivations—Red enforcing protocol under duress, Wolfbot masquerading as a legitimate courier—create confusion at the gate, drawing additional scrutiny from security and delaying both parties.

Red, recognizing the escalating risk, uses her tech skills to trigger a diversion (smoke flare, signal jammer) and attempts to escape into a side alley, with Wolfbot recalibrating its approach and launching a drone to pursue, intent on intercepting the nanomedicine.

----------------------------------------

Amid the chaos, Red weaves through the thickening crowd, her senses sharpened by the relentless presence of Wolfbot and the newly deployed drone. The checkpoint fades behind her as she darts into the maze of alleys, calculating her next move. With Wolfbot adapting his tactics and the city’s surveillance tightening, Red makes a split-second decision—she veers off the main route entirely, slipping toward the dense tree line beyond the city’s edge. The forest promises both peril and concealment, and as Red disappears beneath the canopy, she readies herself to turn the tables on her mechanical pursuer.

# Chapter 4: Red Tricks Wolfbot and Takes the Forest Route

Red crouches behind a dumpster, her gloved fingers tapping on her wrist-console as she programs a fake data trail.

Wolfbot, projecting a flickering blue hologram of a city official, strides down the alley, scanning for heat signatures.

Red tosses a signal jammer into a puddle, sending static through Wolfbot’s sensors.

Wolfbot pauses, recalibrating, then deploys a small spider-drone to search the shadows.

Red darts from her hiding spot, skidding across slick pavement, and ducks through a hole in the chain-link fence, escaping to the city’s wooded outskirts.

Wolfbot, frustrated by the interference, transmits a coded order for Cybershark Gang patrols to converge on Red’s last known location.

The objective: Red must evade Wolfbot’s detection and reach the forest route, while Wolfbot tries to corner her and claim the nanomedicine.

Outcome: Red successfully distracts Wolfbot and escapes toward the forest, setting the stage for pursuit.

----------------------------------------

As Red plunges deeper into the shadowy tangle of the forest, the city’s metallic noises fade behind her, replaced by the tense hum of distant surveillance drones overhead. Every step forward brings her closer to her destination—and to the unknown dangers lurking between the trees. But before she can catch her breath or formulate a plan, something unexpected appears in the moonlit undergrowth: a familiar figure, eerily out of place in the heart of the forbidden woods, blocks her path and sends a chill racing down her spine.

# Chapter 5: Red Encounters Grandma’s Doppelgänger

Red enters the apartment, her boots squelching on the wet entry mat as she clutches a sealed nanomedicine case.

She pauses, scanning the shadows, her hand hovering over her comm-link.

The figure of Grandma sits propped in bed, but when Red approaches, the woman’s movements are slightly off—too still, too precise.

The Doppelgänger beckons, voice soft but occasionally uncertain.

Grandma’s Holographic DoppelgängerThe Doppelgänger raises a hand in a jerky, mechanical wave, lips stretching into a too-wide smile as its gaze fixes unwaveringly on you. The Doppelgänger raised its hand in a jerky, mechanical wave, lips stretching into a too-wide smile that never quite reached its eyes. Fixing its unblinking gaze on you, it beckoned, voice flat and unnervingly even. “Come closer, dear,” it intoned, the words almost echoing in the sterile air. “There’s something you must see—something only I can show you.” The invitation hung in the room, chilling and hollow, as the hologram’s posture stiffened, perfectly poised to lure you nearer.
'Come closer, dear.

There's something you must see—something only I can show you.

' Red hesitates, noting the odd pauses and uncertain mannerisms.

The Doppelgänger continues, faltering and searching for words: 'Oh. my dear, I—hm.

I suppose I should say—no, wait, let me. ah, goodness, it's been so long—hasn't it?

Or. perhaps not.

Forgive me, I—sometimes, it feels like the right words slip away from me, like mist in the morning.' Sensing something off, Red narrows her eyes and steps sideways to flick on the bedside scanner.

The Doppelgänger asks, 'Is this how I used to sound, darling, or am I merely echoing what I think you wish to hear?

Grandma’s Holographic DoppelgängerThe Doppelgänger's voice flickers between warm familiarity and mechanical monotone, its holographic form wavering as if uncertain how to hold itself. The holographic figure flickered at the edge of the bed, its projection wavering ever so slightly as it turned toward Red. “Oh, my dear,” it began, reaching for a tone of warmth that hovered just out of reach. The AI paused, as if searching deep in its programming for an appropriate sentiment. “Hm. I suppose I should say—no, wait, let me…” It hesitated again, a faint smile forming, programmed but not quite convincing. “Ah, goodness, it’s been so long—hasn’t it? Or… perhaps not.” The doppelgänger’s gaze drifted momentarily, the artificial eyes almost wistful. “Forgive me,” it said, voice flattening under the strain of simulated emotion, “sometimes, it feels like the right words slip away from me, like mist in the morning.”
Grandma’s Holographic DoppelgängerThe hologram flickers slightly, its facial features wavering between familiar warmth and uncertain calculation. The holographic doppelgänger flickered, its features momentarily blurring as though caught between faces. A carefully programmed smile hovered on lips that struggled to maintain Grandma’s warmth, but beneath it, a calculated uncertainty flickered through the hologram’s eyes. After a brief hesitation, its voice shifted with an almost imperceptible modulation. “Is this how I used to sound, darling,” it asked, the tone eerily even, “or am I merely echoing what I think you wish to hear?” The question lingered in the air, blending the familiar cadence of Grandma with a mechanical flatness that betrayed nothing of real feeling.
' As static crackles and the scanner hums, the Doppelgänger glitches, flickering at the edges.

Red tightens her grip on the case, circling warily.

She challenges, 'If you’re really her, tell me what you said when I lost my first drone.

' The Doppelgänger hesitates, voice modulating.

Red lunges, tossing a disruptor pellet that scatters blue sparks across the projection.

The hologram shudders, then collapses into digital static, revealing a hidden transmitter embedded in the pillow.

Red snatches up the transmitter, crushing it beneath her boot.

Rain pelts harder as she races to secure the apartment, heart pounding with the realization that Wolfbot’s trap nearly succeeded.

----------------------------------------

Outside, alarms blare through the colony’s corridors, echoing Red’s urgent footsteps as she locks down the apartment. With Wolfbot’s deception exposed, she knows the real threat lurks deeper within the colony. Navigating the maze of emergency protocols and flickering lights, Red steels herself for the confrontation ahead—Wolfbot won’t abandon its hunt for the nanomedicine without a fight. As security drones converge and the core systems flicker with warning signals, Red sets her sights on the heart of the colony, determined to end the infiltration before Wolfbot can make its next move.

# Chapter 6: Red Battles Wolfbot in the Colony Core

Red darts behind a crash cart, clutching the insulated case of nanomedicine.

Wolfbot, its humanoid form shifting with glinting metal and projected shadows, steps into the corridor, scanning with infrared sensors.

Wolfbot's voice glitches, 'Courier—drop the package.

Wolfbot's optical sensors flicker erratically, and its voice warbles, stuttering as if fighting against some internal malfunction. Sparks briefly arc from a panel on its neck. Wolfbot’s voice fractured mid-sentence, its usually smooth cadence disrupted by synthetic stutters. “C-c-courier—dr.drop the p-p-package. Immediate—err0r—protocol engaged.” Its holographic form flickered, a shimmer of static washing over its face as it advanced, movements precise despite the apparent malfunction. The calculated urgency in its tone cut through the alley’s shadows, every word sharpened by an undercurrent of protocol-driven menace. Sensors flared behind its artificial eyes, locking onto the courier’s trembling hands, never missing a beat—even as the error codes bled into its speech.
' Red unslings her toolbelt and hurls a sonic jammer, sending static shrieks through the hallway;

Wolfbot staggers, recalibrating.

Seizing the moment, Red sprints to the medbay door and slaps her palm to the biometric lock, locking it behind her.

Wolfbot, undeterred, deploys a hacking module that sparks against the panel, forcing the door's mechanisms to grind and smoke.

Red's objective is to reach Grandma before Wolfbot breaches the door;

Wolfbot aims to seize the nanomedicine by any means.

The scene ends with Wolfbot forcing the door open while Red drags a supply crate to barricade it from inside, both driven by their urgent motivations.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the cacophony of Wolfbot’s assault echoed down the corridor as Red pressed forward, adrenaline fueling her every step. With the nanomedicine secured—at least for now—her focus sharpened to a single point: reaching Grandma before it was too late. Each second counted, and as the sounds of pursuit grew fainter behind her barricade, Red realized that this desperate race was only the beginning. Ahead lay not just a battle for survival, but a chance for new alliances and promises that would shape the colony’s fate.

# Chapter 7: Red Delivers the Nanomed and Makes a Pact

Red vaults over a pile of rain-slicked crates, landing in a crouch as the Cybershark Gang Leader and two gang members block her escape, chrome limbs gleaming under neon.

The Leader slams a cybernetic fist into a nearby trashcan, sending it spinning, and snarls, 'Hand over the vial, pup, or we rip it from you.

' Red grips her courier bag tighter, scanning for exits, and snaps, 'Not a chance.

I run faster than you bite.

' One gang member lunges, grabbing for Red’s arm;

she twists free, shoves the nanomed vial into her jacket’s hidden pocket, and hurls a flash pellet at their feet.

As the alley erupts in blinding light and the acrid smell of burning magnesium fills the air, Red sprints toward a narrow gap between fences, chased by the gang’s echoing footsteps and shouts.

Her objective: escape with the nanomed intact.

The outcome: Red evades immediate capture, but the gang remains in pursuit, forcing her to take a longer, riskier route to the colony.

----------------------------------------

With the nanomed secure and the city’s dangers fading behind her, Red pressed onward through the rain-soaked maze, resolved to deliver hope where it was needed most—and to forge her own path in a world forever changed.
