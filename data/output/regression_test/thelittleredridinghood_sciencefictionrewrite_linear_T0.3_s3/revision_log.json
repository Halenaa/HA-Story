It also clarifies the necessity of the data chip for operating the nanomedicine. The original plot did not mention the EMP nets, the conversation about route selection, or the explicit function of the chip. The updated plot now incorporates these details from the dialogue for consistency.",

Wolfbot, instead of acting as an enforcer, falsely claims to be a courier, which introduces confusion and shifts its approach from direct confrontation to deception. The updated plot now reflects these new behaviors and motivations, maintaining logical continuity and escalating the checkpoint tension.",
