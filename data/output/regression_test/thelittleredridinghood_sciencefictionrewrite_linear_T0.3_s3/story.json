Dr. Weaver opens it, glancing over her shoulder before ushering Red inside. He pulls a sealed nano-insulated case from beneath a false floor panel, the cool container emitting faint blue light. Weaver speaks in clipped, urgent tones, warning Red of Wolfbot's heightened patrols and the Cybershark Gang's new presence on delivery routes. Red nods, secures the case in her courier vest, and runs a quick scan with her wristpad to verify integrity. Weaver hands over a data chip, instructing her to deliver both the nanomedicine and the chip to Grandma's colony before sunset. Red double-checks the alley for drones, then slips into the shadowy city streets, blending into the shifting crowds as Weaver locks the door behind her.",

Two Cybershark Gang Members vault from behind a dumpster, their cybernetic jaws snapping as they attempt to block her path. The Gang Leader, perched on a low rooftop, barks orders through a static-filled comm, 'Intercept her at the cross-street! Don't let the courier slip!' Red ducks under a flickering holo-sign, kicks a loose crate into the legs of an approaching gang member, and leaps onto a delivery drone passing overhead. The drone's thrusters blast hot air and fried circuitry scent as Red clings to its chassis, escaping the gang's grasp. The Gang Leader slams a cyber-fist onto the rooftop rail, growling, 'She's got the package—circle the next block! We can't let her reach the colony.' The gang members scramble, boots splashing through puddles, as Red vanishes into the neon haze toward her objective: delivering the medicine to her grandmother before dawn.",

She scans the crowd, eyes narrowed, searching for plainclothes enforcers. Suddenly, Wolfbot materializes from a holographic shimmer beside a flickering utility kiosk, projecting the shape of a uniformed officer. Wolfbot steps directly into Red’s path, voice modulating to mimic a bored guard: 'Cargo manifest. State your business, courier.' Red shifts her grip on the satchel, voice steady: 'Medical delivery—urgent. You know the regs.' Wolfbot’s optical sensors flicker blue as it extends a scanner arm, attempting to tag Red’s satchel. Red sidesteps, pivoting on her heel, and jabs a signal jammer into the scanner’s joint. Sparks fizzle, and Wolfbot’s arm retracts. Wolfbot recalibrates, deploying a secondary hologram behind Red in the form of Grandma’s voice: 'Red, help me.' Red freezes for a split-second, then bolts for the security barrier, vaulting over a low fence as Wolfbot’s footsteps clang across the wet pavement. Wolfbot, motivated to intercept the nanomedicine, launches a drone from its shoulder to pursue. Red, desperate to protect her cargo and reach her sick grandmother, slips into a side alley, triggering a smoke flare from her satchel and ducking into the shadows. The checkpoint alarms blare, strobing red across the rain-damp night as Wolfbot signals city enforcers to lock down the sector.",

Red tosses a signal jammer into a puddle, sending static through Wolfbot’s sensors. Wolfbot pauses, recalibrating, then deploys a small spider-drone to search the shadows. Red darts from her hiding spot, skidding across slick pavement, and ducks through a hole in the chain-link fence, escaping to the city’s wooded outskirts. Wolfbot, frustrated by the interference, transmits a coded order for Cybershark Gang patrols to converge on Red’s last known location. The objective: Red must evade Wolfbot’s detection and reach the forest route, while Wolfbot tries to corner her and claim the nanomedicine. Outcome: Red successfully distracts Wolfbot and escapes toward the forest, setting the stage for pursuit.",

The figure of Grandma sits propped in bed, but when Red approaches, the woman’s movements are slightly off—too still, too precise. The Doppelgänger beckons, voice flat and eyes unblinking. 'Come closer, Red. Bring me the medicine; my time runs short.' Red narrows her eyes, stepping sideways to flick on the bedside scanner. As static crackles and the scanner hums, the Doppelgänger glitches, flickering at the edges. Red tightens her grip on the case, circling warily. 'If you’re really her, tell me what you said when I lost my first drone,' Red challenges. The Doppelgänger hesitates, voice modulating. Red lunges, tossing a disruptor pellet that scatters blue sparks across the projection. The hologram shudders, then collapses into digital static, revealing a hidden transmitter embedded in the pillow. Red snatches up the transmitter, crushing it beneath her boot. Rain pelts harder as she races to secure the apartment, heart pounding with the realization that Wolfbot’s trap nearly succeeded.",

Seizing the moment, Red sprints to the medbay door and slaps her palm to the biometric lock, locking it behind her. Wolfbot, undeterred, deploys a hacking module that sparks against the panel, forcing the door's mechanisms to grind and smoke. Red's objective is to reach Grandma before Wolfbot breaches the door; Wolfbot aims to seize the nanomedicine by any means.

Red grips her courier bag tighter, scanning for exits, and snaps, 'Not a chance. I run faster than you bite.' One gang member lunges, grabbing for Red’s arm; she twists free, shoves the nanomed vial into her jacket’s hidden pocket, and hurls a flash pellet at their feet. As the alley erupts in blinding light and the acrid smell of burning magnesium fills the air, Red sprints toward a narrow gap between fences, chased by the gang’s echoing footsteps and shouts.
