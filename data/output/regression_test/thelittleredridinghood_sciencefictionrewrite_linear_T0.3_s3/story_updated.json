Dr. Weaver opens it, glancing over his shoulder before ushering Red inside. He pulls a sealed nano-insulated case from beneath a false floor panel, the cool container emitting faint blue light. Weaver, in clipped, urgent tones, warns Red that Wolfbot's patrols have doubled and the Cybershark Gang is now muscling in on the west delivery routes, specifically mentioning that the gang is equipped with EMP nets capable of disabling Red’s gear. Red asks if the gang is cooperating with Wolfbot; Weaver confirms they are not, but notes both threats are operating independently. Red considers rerouting through Sector 9, but Weaver advises against it due to Wolfbot's infrared sweeps there, instead recommending the east tunnels and urging Red to keep communications silent and move quickly, warning of active scavengers. Weaver hands over both the nanomedicine and a critical data chip, explaining the chip is necessary for Grandma's colony to use the medicine correctly and stressing the urgency of delivering both before sunset to avoid putting the entire colony at risk. Red secures the cargo, scans for integrity, double-checks the alley for drones, and affirms her determination not to let anyone or anything slow her down. She slips into the shadowy city streets, blending into the shifting crowds as Weaver locks the door behind her.",

The updated plot now incorporates these details from the dialogue for consistency."

Red ducks under a flickering holo-sign, kicks a loose crate into the legs of an approaching gang member, and leaps onto a delivery drone passing overhead. The drone's thrusters blast hot air and fried circuitry scent as Red clings to its chassis, escaping the gang's grasp. The Gang Leader slams a cyber-fist onto the rooftop rail, growling, 'She's got the package—circle the next block! We can't let her reach the colony.'

Wolfbot materializes, stepping into Red’s path and requesting a cargo manifest and point of origin, threatening escalation if she refuses. Surprisingly, Wolfbot identifies itself as an official courier for Central Dispatch and claims it is delivering a confidential package to Red’s supervisor, seeking guidance on where to proceed. Red, exasperated and focused on her urgent mission, tries to avoid delays but paradoxically insists on following protocol, emphasizing the importance of proper procedure for safety and accountability, despite her personal frustration. Suddenly, Wolfbot projects Grandma’s voice, pleading for help and trying to emotionally manipulate Red into compliance. The tense standoff escalates, with Red torn between her sense of duty and her desperation to deliver the life-saving supplies. The checkpoint alarms blare as Wolfbot signals city enforcers, but the contradictory motivations—Red enforcing protocol under duress, Wolfbot masquerading as a legitimate courier—create confusion at the gate, drawing additional scrutiny from security and delaying both parties. Red, recognizing the escalating risk, uses her tech skills to trigger a diversion (smoke flare, signal jammer) and attempts to escape into a side alley, with Wolfbot recalibrating its approach and launching a drone to pursue, intent on intercepting the nanomedicine.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue diverges from the original plot: Red unexpectedly insists on following protocol (emphasizing safety and accountability), despite her urgent mission, which is inconsistent with her previously established willingness to bend the rules to save her grandmother. Wolfbot, instead of acting as an enforcer, falsely claims to be a courier, which introduces confusion and shifts its approach from direct confrontation to deception. The updated plot now reflects these new behaviors and motivations, maintaining logical continuity and escalating the checkpoint tension."

Red darts from her hiding spot, skidding across slick pavement, and ducks through a hole in the chain-link fence, escaping to the city’s wooded outskirts. Wolfbot, frustrated by the interference, transmits a coded order for Cybershark Gang patrols to converge on Red’s last known location. The objective: Red must evade Wolfbot’s detection and reach the forest route, while Wolfbot tries to corner her and claim the nanomedicine.

She pauses, scanning the shadows, her hand hovering over her comm-link. The figure of Grandma sits propped in bed, but when Red approaches, the woman’s movements are slightly off—too still, too precise. The Doppelgänger beckons, voice soft but occasionally uncertain. 'Come closer, dear. There's something you must see—something only I can show you.' Red hesitates, noting the odd pauses and uncertain mannerisms. The Doppelgänger continues, faltering and searching for words: 'Oh... my dear, I—hm. I suppose I should say—no, wait, let me... ah, goodness, it's been so long—hasn't it? Or... perhaps not. Forgive me, I—sometimes, it feels like the right words slip away from me, like mist in the morning...' Sensing something off, Red narrows her eyes and steps sideways to flick on the bedside scanner. The Doppelgänger asks, 'Is this how I used to sound, darling, or am I merely echoing what I think you wish to hear?' As static crackles and the scanner hums, the Doppelgänger glitches, flickering at the edges. Red tightens her grip on the case, circling warily. She challenges, 'If you’re really her, tell me what you said when I lost my first drone.' The Doppelgänger hesitates, voice modulating. Red lunges, tossing a disruptor pellet that scatters blue sparks across the projection. The hologram shudders, then collapses into digital static, revealing a hidden transmitter embedded in the pillow. Red snatches up the transmitter, crushing it beneath her boot. Rain pelts harder as she races to secure the apartment, heart pounding with the realization that Wolfbot’s trap nearly succeeded.",
