Mira, bundled in a dark cloak, approaches swiftly, boot soles splashing in shallow puddles. She thrusts a small, data-encoded vial into Red's gloved hand and grips her daughter's shoulder, voice urgent: 'This package must reach Dr. Ilan before sunrise—Wolf is already hunting for it.' Mira emphasizes the secrecy and importance of the mission, urging Red to promise she will not let anyone stop her. Mira expresses pride and maternal concern, mentioning her anxiety about Red leaving before breakfast and the forest's early-morning quiet. Suddenly, Wolf arrives, his words menacing, hinting at his intent to retrieve the package. Mira stands her ground, warning Wolf to stay away from her daughter. Tension escalates as Wolf makes clear his determination. Mira regains focus, projecting a holographic map of regime checkpoints and outlining a covert route. She details fallback options if patrols shift, demonstrating strategic thinking. Red listens, asks about backup plans, and receives instructions on alternative exits. Overhead, the drone's lights flare—a warning. Mira signals Red to move, and Red darts for the edge of the roof, vaulting onto a fire escape as Mira wipes away the digital map and ducks into shadow. The objective: Red receives the secret package and mission instructions, setting off into the city under threat of immediate pursuit, now with Wolf's presence and intent established.",

        "plot_change_note": "Dialogue introduces Dr. Ilan (instead of Dr. Su) as the recipient of the package, and includes a direct confrontation between Mira and Wolf at home before Red sets out—whereas the original plot had only Mira and Red, with Wolf as a distant threat. Mira also shows maternal concern in dialogue, referencing Red's early morning departure, which was not present in the original plot. To match the dialogue, the updated plot includes Wolf's direct approach and Mira's protective stance, as well as her emotional concern for Red."

She ducks behind a vending kiosk as Drone Unit 17 sweeps low, its sensors buzzing and red lights scanning for contraband. Agent Kade steps out from a security pod, coordinating closely with Drone Unit 17: 'Drone, confirm visual lock. Prepare countermeasures and synchronize with my HUD feed.' The drone confirms, priming containment protocol alpha and tightening the perimeter. Kade signals, and the drone initiates lockdown, sealing entry and exit points. As Red hacks a malfunctioning street panel to create a flare distraction, she reports her sector breach over comms, revealing ongoing contact with Kade. Kade warns Red of converging hostiles from grid north, indicating a complex relationship—perhaps forced cooperation or uneasy alliance—while the drone briefly loses track of Red. Red insists she can't hold her position and moves toward extraction point Delta, advising backup to watch for heat signatures in the alleys. The drone's systems fail momentarily. Red escapes into the next sector, package secured, with Kade and the disabled drone left behind in the rain-soaked gutter.",

This deviates from the original plot where Kade is solely an antagonist.

Wolf, his avatar flickering in the air as a holographic wolf with chromed fur, materializes beside her, intercepting her comm signals with a burst of static. He projects a warning growl through nearby speakers and overrides the alley’s security lights, plunging the space into a strobing red-white chaos. Red yanks a signal jammer from her belt and slams it against the wall, scrambling Wolf’s hold on the lights. With her heart pounding, she shoves her satchel into the open conduit and slams the grate shut, then pivots to face Wolf’s avatar, demanding, 'What do you want from me?' Wolf’s voice, metallic and smooth, echoes: 'The package, courier. Hand it over, or I reroute every drone in this quadrant to you.' As Wolf reroutes a surveillance drone overhead, Red triggers a flash grenade, blinding the sensors, and sprints down the alley. Wolf, calculating, begins hijacking city security feeds to track her escape. The confrontation leaves the package hidden, Red on the run, and Wolf intensifying his pursuit.",

The drone sweeps overhead, infrared beams slicing through the mist as it locks onto Red’s heat signature. Red hacks a maintenance terminal, rerouting power to trigger a short circuit in the drone’s sensors, causing it to spiral momentarily out of control. Wolf advances, his voice modulator echoing, 'Hand over the package, courier. Your resistance ends here.' Red launches a smoke pellet, dives across slick tiles, and scrambles down a utility ladder toward the fire escape, clutching the data chip tightly. Wolf transmits a location update to regime agents, relentless in pursuit. The drone recovers and circles, searching for Red’s next move.

Driven by its programming to detect intruders, Drone Unit 17 halts, emits a sharp warning chirp, and deploys a micro-searchlight.
