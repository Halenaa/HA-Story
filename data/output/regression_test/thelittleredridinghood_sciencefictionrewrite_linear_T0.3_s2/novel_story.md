# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Mission

Red crouches behind a rusted ventilation shaft, scanning the horizon as a regime patrol drone buzzes past, its searchlight slicing through the drizzle.

Mira, bundled in a dark cloak, approaches swiftly, boot soles splashing in shallow puddles.

She thrusts a small, data-encoded vial into Red's gloved hand and grips her daughter's shoulder, voice urgent: 'This package must reach Dr.

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira presses the encoded vial into Red's gloved hand, her own voice trembling with urgency as she squeezes her daughter's shoulder, her eyes shining with fear and hope. "Red, listen to me—this package must reach Dr. Ilan before dawn. No one else can know you have it. What's inside could change everything for our people, or destroy us if it falls into the wrong hands. I need you to promise me: whatever happens, you won't let anyone stop you." ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Red clutches the vial tightly, her jaw set with determination as she meets her mother's anxious gaze, nodding once before tucking the package safely inside her coat. "I promise, Mama—I won't let you down, no matter what." ——Red

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira squeezes Red's shoulder one last time, her eyes glistening with tears she refuses to let fall, then pushes her gently toward the shadowed path beyond the door. "Good—remember, Red, I love you more than anything, and I'm so proud of the woman you've become." ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Ilan before sunrise—Wolf is already hunting for it.

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira adjusts the curtains, glancing out into the dim blue light, her brow furrowed with concern as she listens for any unusual sounds beyond the cottage walls. "Red, dear, it's so early—the sun hasn't even peeked over the hills yet. You know how I worry when you wander out before breakfast. The forest feels different in this quiet, doesn't it?" ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Wolf glides silently among the trees, nostrils flaring as he catches the faintest scent of Red on the wind. "The darkness is my ally, Mira; every shadow hides a hunger, and this morning, mine leads me straight to your door." ——Wolf

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira tightens her shawl around her shoulders, eyes narrowing as she peers into the dimness beyond the doorway. "What brings you prowling so close to our home at this hour, Wolf?" ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Wolf lowers his massive head, nostrils flaring as he circles near the edge of the clearing, eyes glinting with anticipation. "Scent guides me, Mira—there’s something sweeter than dawn itself waiting just inside your walls." ——Wolf

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira stands firmly in the doorway, her hand tightening around the latch as she watches Wolf with wary eyes. "Stay back, Wolf—your words slither like fog, and I’ll not let you near my daughter while the world still sleeps." ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Wolf circles the edge of the clearing, eyes gleaming in the fading darkness, muscles taut with anticipation. "Fear sharpens the air, Mira, and it draws me ever closer—no locked door can hold back the hunger that walks before sunrise." ——Wolf

' Mira emphasizes the secrecy and importance of the mission, urging Red to promise she will not let anyone stop her.

Mira expresses pride and maternal concern, mentioning her anxiety about Red leaving before breakfast and the forest's early-morning quiet.

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira projects the holographic map from her wrist tablet onto the table, tracing the blue route with her finger while keeping a watchful eye on Red, gauging their reaction and readiness. "Red, look here—these red markers are the active regime checkpoints. They've doubled patrols along the main corridors since the last breach. If we try to go straight through, they'll catch us before we even make it to the outer sector. Now, this—this blue line—is our best covert route. We’ll cut through the old service tunnels beneath the market, then slip past the supply depot here. It's tight, but if we follow these timings and keep our heads down, we can avoid the cameras and patrol shifts. Do you understand the importance of sticking exactly to the plan? One wrong turn, and we’re both at risk." ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Red leans in closer to the holographic map, eyes flicking between the blue line and the red markers, voice low with a mix of anxiety and resolve. "Yeah, I get it, but what if one of the patrols changes their route—do we have any backup exits, or is this all or nothing?" ——Red

Red's Mother (Mira)Mira zooms in on the holographic map, highlighting two small green icons and locking eyes with Red to emphasize the gravity of her words. "If a patrol shifts unexpectedly, we have two fallback points—here at the maintenance hatch and here behind the depot’s cold storage; but Red, improvising means more risk, so only use them if absolutely necessary." ——Red's Mother (Mira)

Suddenly, Wolf arrives, his words menacing, hinting at his intent to retrieve the package.

Mira stands her ground, warning Wolf to stay away from her daughter.

Tension escalates as Wolf makes clear his determination.

Mira regains focus, projecting a holographic map of regime checkpoints and outlining a covert route.

She details fallback options if patrols shift, demonstrating strategic thinking.

Red listens, asks about backup plans, and receives instructions on alternative exits.

Overhead, the drone's lights flare—a warning.

Mira signals Red to move, and Red darts for the edge of the roof, vaulting onto a fire escape as Mira wipes away the digital map and ducks into shadow.

The objective: Red receives the secret package and mission instructions, setting off into the city under threat of immediate pursuit, now with Wolf's presence and intent established.

# Chapter 2: Checkpoint Ambush

Red sprints through the alley, clutching a weatherproof package, her boots splashing through rainwater.

She ducks behind a vending kiosk as Drone Unit 17 sweeps low, its sensors buzzing and red lights scanning for contraband.

Agent Kade steps out from a security pod, coordinating closely with Drone Unit 17: 'Drone, confirm visual lock.

Agent Kade steps forward from the pod, baton raised and eyes scanning the perimeter, signaling the drone with a sharp gesture. "Drone Unit 17, confirm visual lock on the target. Maintain formation and await my signal—no deviation. This is a live extraction. Any breach in protocol puts the mission at risk." ——Agent Kade

Drone Unit 17 hovers into position, sensors focusing on the target, lights pulsing in standby mode. "Affirmative, Agent Kade—visual lock confirmed and formation maintained; standing by for your signal—protocol integrity at one hundred percent." ——Drone Unit 17

Agent Kade glances at his wrist display, eyes narrowing as he scans the perimeter for hostiles. "Good—prepare countermeasures and synchronize with my HUD feed; on my mark, initiate containment protocol alpha." ——Agent Kade

Drone Unit 17Activates countermeasures, HUD link flashes green, motors hum with readiness. "Containment protocol alpha primed and synchronization complete, Agent Kade; awaiting your mark for execution." ——Drone Unit 17

Agent Kade taps his HUD, signaling the drone to advance while scanning for hostile movement. "Mark given—execute containment protocol alpha, and keep comms clear for incoming variables." ——Agent Kade

Prepare countermeasures and synchronize with my HUD feed.

Agent Kade issues a firm command, monitoring status displays as the lockdown sequence begins. "Drone Unit 17, initiate perimeter lockdown protocol. Confirm all entry and exit points are secured and report any anomalies immediately." ——Agent Kade

Drone Unit 17Activating perimeter sensors and locking access points. "Perimeter lockdown protocol initiated, Agent Kade; all entry and exit points are being secured—no anomalies detected at this time." ——Drone Unit 17

' The drone confirms, priming containment protocol alpha and tightening the perimeter.

Kade signals, and the drone initiates lockdown, sealing entry and exit points.

As Red hacks a malfunctioning street panel to create a flare distraction, she reports her sector breach over comms, revealing ongoing contact with Kade.

Kade warns Red of converging hostiles from grid north, indicating a complex relationship—perhaps forced cooperation or uneasy alliance—while the drone briefly loses track of Red.

Red sprints through the slick, neon-lit alley, clutching the encrypted package to her chest. Rain pelts her, mixing with the adrenaline in her veins as the distant whine of sirens and Kade's angry voice crackle through the comms behind her. "Package secured—I'm clear! Sector C breach successful, but they're right behind me. Battery at twenty percent; rerouting through alleyways. Too close, Red, too close." ——Red

Agent KadeKade slams his fist against the console, eyes flicking between the flickering drone feed and Red's vital signs as the drone emits a garbled static burst before its camera winks out. "Kade: Dammit, Red, hold your position—backup en route, but you've got hostiles converging from grid north!" ——Agent Kade

Drone Unit 17Sparks flicker from Unit 17's chassis as rainwater shorts its circuits, its lens flickering out while Kade's voice crackles unanswered in the downpour. "Unit 17: --system fail--tracking.Red.lost--" ——Drone Unit 17

Red darts through a narrow passage, heart pounding, as distant shouts echo and her comm crackles with static. "Red: Negative, Kade—no time, I'm moving to extraction point Delta; tell backup to watch for heat signatures in the alleys!" ——Red

Red insists she can't hold her position and moves toward extraction point Delta, advising backup to watch for heat signatures in the alleys.

The drone's systems fail momentarily.

Red escapes into the next sector, package secured, with Kade and the disabled drone left behind in the rain-soaked gutter.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Wolf's Interference

Red darts beneath a metal awning, clutching a waterproof satchel, scanning the shadowed corners for watchers.

Water drips steadily from her jacket as she kneels, prying open a service grate to access an underground conduit.

Wolf, his avatar flickering in the air as a holographic wolf with chromed fur, materializes beside her, intercepting her comm signals with a burst of static.

He projects a warning growl through nearby speakers and overrides the alley’s security lights, plunging the space into a strobing red-white chaos.

Red yanks a signal jammer from her belt and slams it against the wall, scrambling Wolf’s hold on the lights.

With her heart pounding, she shoves her satchel into the open conduit and slams the grate shut, then pivots to face Wolf’s avatar, demanding, 'What do you want from me?

' Wolf’s voice, metallic and smooth, echoes: 'The package, courier.

Hand it over, or I reroute every drone in this quadrant to you.

' As Wolf reroutes a surveillance drone overhead, Red triggers a flash grenade, blinding the sensors, and sprints down the alley.

Wolf, calculating, begins hijacking city security feeds to track her escape.

The confrontation leaves the package hidden, Red on the run, and Wolf intensifying his pursuit.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Grandmother’s Signal

Red crouches behind a battered air conditioning unit, her gloved fingers tapping rapidly on her wrist console to intercept the encrypted signal from her grandmother.

Wolf, his sleek synthetic frame glimmering with moisture, scans the rooftop with glowing ocular sensors, recalibrating his targeting protocols and sending a silent command to Drone Unit 17.

The drone sweeps overhead, infrared beams slicing through the mist as it locks onto Red’s heat signature.

Red hacks a maintenance terminal, rerouting power to trigger a short circuit in the drone’s sensors, causing it to spiral momentarily out of control.

Wolf advances, his voice modulator echoing, 'Hand over the package, courier.

Your resistance ends here.

' Red launches a smoke pellet, dives across slick tiles, and scrambles down a utility ladder toward the fire escape, clutching the data chip tightly.

Wolf transmits a location update to regime agents, relentless in pursuit.

The drone recovers and circles, searching for Red’s next move.

Outcome: Red escapes the rooftop with the signal and package, but Wolf and Drone Unit 17 remain in pursuit, now aware of her location.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Lab Break-In

Red crouches behind a rusted delivery truck, her gloved fingers tapping rapid commands into her wrist console, overriding the outer perimeter sensors.

As she slips across the puddle-slick loading dock, the buzz of Drone Unit 17 grows louder.

The drone lowers, scanlights sweeping, and Red flattens herself against the textured metal door, holding her breath as the drone's sensor grid passes inches above her head.

Driven by its programming to detect intruders, Drone Unit 17 halts, emits a sharp warning chirp, and deploys a micro-searchlight.

Red tosses a hacked sensor decoy into a nearby dumpster, drawing the drone away long enough for her to unscrew the lock panel and slip inside the lab's maintenance corridor.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Wolf's Ultimatum

Red darts beneath the overpass, clutching a weatherproof satchel, her boots splashing through puddles as she scans the shadows for pursuit.

Wolf materializes from a digital shimmer projected onto a graffitied pillar, his synthetic voice echoing with predatory calm: 'Hand over the package, courier, and you might leave on your own two legs.

' Red edges back, eyes darting for an escape route, but Drone Unit 17 drops from the sky, its spotlights slicing through the rain.

The drone's speakers crackle: 'Unauthorized presence detected.

Prepare for detainment.

' Wolf pivots, hacking the drone's targeting array with a gesture, causing its lights to stutter and its sensors to glitch.

Red uses the distraction to vault over a low barrier, skidding across slick pavement, as Wolf sends a garbled command to the drone: 'Acquire the courier.

Override protocol.

' The scene ends with Red ducking into a narrow alley, Wolf advancing with calculated steps, and the drone's rotors slicing the damp air behind them.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: Escape and Revelation

Red, sensing something off in the lab, seeks out her grandmother, Dr.

Lin Su, to discuss her urgent concerns about unusual symptoms she has noticed in patients on the third floor.

Red raises her hand slightly and catches Dr. Lin Su's eye, signaling discreetly from across the room. "Dr. Lin Su, excuse me—could I speak with you for a moment? It's important." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)Dr. Lin Su turns her full attention to Red, sensing the urgency and preparing to listen closely. "Of course, Red—what's troubling you?" ——Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)

Red glances nervously around, her tone serious, prompting Dr. Lin Su to pay close attention and prepare to respond. "Thank you; I need your help urgently—something isn't right and I couldn't ignore it." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)Dr. Lin Su gently guides Red to a quieter corner, signaling her full attention and readiness to assist. "I understand, Red; let's step aside so you can tell me everything—I'm listening." ——Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)

Red leads Dr. Lin Su toward the third floor, signaling the urgency of the situation. "Thank you, Dr. Lin Su—I've noticed some unusual symptoms in the patients on the third floor, and I think we need to check on them right away." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)Dr. Lin Su signals readiness to accompany Red and heads toward the third floor with urgency. "Your concern is well-placed, Red—let's go to the third floor together and assess the situation immediately." ——Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)

The two step aside to plan an immediate assessment, but their covert conversation is interrupted by Wolf, who hacks into the rooftop security systems and issues a threatening ultimatum over the speakers, demanding the secret package.

Red, prioritizing both her grandmother's safety and the mission, urges Dr.

Lin Su to trust her as they prepare to evade Wolf's search.

Red pulls Dr. Lin Su behind the cold metal of the ventilation shaft, pressing a finger to her lips while Wolf's voice crackles and booms through the overhead speakers, echoing down the dimly lit corridor. "Stay low, Grandma. Don't make a sound—he's close. I won't let him find you. Whatever happens, I need you to trust me. The package—it's the only thing he wants. But I won't let him take it. Not after everything we've lost." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)Dr. Lin Su squeezes Red's hand, her voice trembling but resolute as she glances anxiously toward the echoing speakers. "Red, my brave girl, you mustn't risk yourself for me—the research in that package could save thousands, but not if you fall into his hands." ——Grandmother (Dr. Lin Su)

WolfRed instinctively presses her grandmother closer to the wall, glancing at the ticking clock above the door as Wolf's voice reverberates through the darkened vents. "Wolf (voice echoing through speakers): You have one minute, Red—either hand over the package, or I'll tear this place apart to find you both." ——Wolf

They move stealthily towards the emergency exit, staying low to avoid detection.

The tension escalates as they hear the alarms triggered by Wolf's actions, forcing them to improvise their escape.

Red leads Dr.

Lin Su to the emergency zipline, and together they launch themselves off the rooftop, narrowly escaping Wolf's grasp as the city lights blur below.
