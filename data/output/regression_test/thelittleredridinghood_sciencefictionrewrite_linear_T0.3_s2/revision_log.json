Mira also shows maternal concern in dialogue, referencing Red's early morning departure, which was not present in the original plot. To match the dialogue, the updated plot includes Wolf's direct approach and Mira's protective stance, as well as her emotional concern for Red.",

This deviates from the original plot where Kade is solely an antagonist.
