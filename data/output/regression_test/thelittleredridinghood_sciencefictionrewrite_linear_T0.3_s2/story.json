Mira, bundled in a dark cloak, approaches swiftly, boot soles splashing in shallow puddles. She thrusts a small, data-encoded vial into Red's gloved hand and grips her daughter's shoulder, voice urgent: 'This package must reach Dr. Su before sunrise—Wolf is already hunting for it.' Red tucks the vial into her jacket, adjusts her utility belt, and checks the magnetic lockpick on her wrist. Mira consults her wrist tablet, projecting a holographic map of regime checkpoints, and outlines a covert route. Overhead, the drone's lights flare—a warning. Mira signals Red to move, and Red darts for the edge of the roof, vaulting onto a fire escape as Mira wipes away the digital map and ducks into shadow. The objective: Red receives the secret package and the mission instructions, setting off into the city under threat of immediate pursuit.",

She ducks behind a vending kiosk as Drone Unit 17 sweeps low, its sensors buzzing and red lights scanning for contraband. Agent Kade steps out from a security pod, raising his baton and signaling the drone, 'Target acquired. Lock perimeter.' Red hacks a malfunctioning street panel, causing nearby lights to flare and momentarily blind the drone. She vaults over the barricade just as Kade lunges, his gloved hand grazing her jacket. The drone emits a warning siren, but Red tosses an EMP grenade, causing its rotors to sputter. She escapes into the next sector, package secured, while Kade radios for backup and the disabled drone sputters in the rain-soaked gutter.",

Water drips steadily from her jacket as she kneels, prying open a service grate to access an underground conduit. Wolf, his avatar flickering in the air as a holographic wolf with chromed fur, materializes beside her, intercepting her comm signals with a burst of static. He projects a warning growl through nearby speakers and overrides the alley’s security lights, plunging the space into a strobing red-white chaos. Red yanks a signal jammer from her belt and slams it against the wall, scrambling Wolf’s hold on the lights. With her heart pounding, she shoves her satchel into the open conduit and slams the grate shut, then pivots to face Wolf’s avatar, demanding, 'What do you want from me?' Wolf’s voice, metallic and smooth, echoes: 'The package, courier. Hand it over, or I reroute every drone in this quadrant to you.' As Wolf reroutes a surveillance drone overhead, Red triggers a flash grenade, blinding the sensors, and sprints down the alley. Wolf, calculating, begins hijacking city security feeds to track her escape. The confrontation leaves the package hidden, Red on the run, and Wolf intensifying his pursuit.",

Wolf, his sleek synthetic frame glimmering with moisture, scans the rooftop with glowing ocular sensors, recalibrating his targeting protocols and sending a silent command to Drone Unit 17. The drone sweeps overhead, infrared beams slicing through the mist as it locks onto Red’s heat signature. Red hacks a maintenance terminal, rerouting power to trigger a short circuit in the drone’s sensors, causing it to spiral momentarily out of control. Wolf advances, his voice modulator echoing, 'Hand over the package, courier. Your resistance ends here.' Red launches a smoke pellet, dives across slick tiles, and scrambles down a utility ladder toward the fire escape, clutching the data chip tightly. Wolf transmits a location update to regime agents, relentless in pursuit. The drone recovers and circles, searching for Red’s next move. Outcome: Red escapes the rooftop with the signal and package, but Wolf and Drone Unit 17 remain in pursuit, now aware of her location.",

The drone lowers, scanlights sweeping, and Red flattens herself against the textured metal door, holding her breath as the drone's sensor grid passes inches above her head. Driven by its programming to detect intruders, Drone Unit 17 halts, emits a sharp warning chirp, and deploys a micro-searchlight. Red tosses a hacked sensor decoy into a nearby dumpster, drawing the drone away long enough for her to unscrew the lock panel and slip inside the lab's maintenance corridor.",

Red jams her comm-link into the access port, attempting to override Wolf's command. Wolf reroutes the electronic locks, but Red rapidly rewires the panel, sparks flying from her multitool.

Lin Su, motivated by her plan to sabotage the project, deliberately connects two circuits incorrectly. Hale narrows his eyes, reviewing the data stream, then snaps, 'You think I won't notice?
