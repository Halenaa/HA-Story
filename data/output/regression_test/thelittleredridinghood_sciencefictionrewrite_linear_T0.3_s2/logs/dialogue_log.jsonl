Mira emphasizes the secrecy and importance of the mission, urging Red to promise she will not let anyone stop her. Mira expresses pride and maternal concern, mentioning her anxiety about Red leaving before breakfast and the forest's early-morning quiet. Suddenly, Wolf arrives, his words menacing, hinting at his intent to retrieve the package. Mira stands her ground, warning Wolf to stay away from her daughter. Tension escalates as Wolf makes clear his determination. Mira regains focus, projecting a holographic map of regime checkpoints and outlining a covert route. She details fallback options if patrols shift, demonstrating strategic thinking. Red listens, asks about backup plans, and receives instructions on alternative exits. Overhead, the drone's lights flare—a warning. Mira signals Red to move, and Red darts for the edge of the roof, vaulting onto a fire escape as Mira wipes away the digital map and ducks into shadow.

He projects a warning growl through nearby speakers and overrides the alley’s security lights, plunging the space into a strobing red-white chaos. Red yanks a signal jammer from her belt and slams it against the wall, scrambling Wolf’s hold on the lights. With her heart pounding, she shoves her satchel into the open conduit and slams the grate shut, then pivots to face Wolf’s avatar, demanding, 'What do you want from me?' Wolf’s voice, metallic and smooth, echoes: 'The package, courier. Hand it over, or I reroute every drone in this quadrant to you.' As Wolf reroutes a surveillance drone overhead, Red triggers a flash grenade, blinding the sensors, and sprints down the alley. Wolf, calculating, begins hijacking city security feeds to track her escape.
