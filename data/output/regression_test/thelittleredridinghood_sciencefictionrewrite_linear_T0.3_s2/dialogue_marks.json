Mira, bundled in a dark cloak, approaches swiftly, boot soles splashing in shallow puddles. She thrusts a small, data-encoded vial into Red's gloved hand and grips her daughter's shoulder, voice urgent: 'This package must reach Dr. Su before sunrise—Wolf is already hunting for it.' Red tucks the vial into her jacket, adjusts her utility belt, and checks the magnetic lockpick on her wrist. Mira consults her wrist tablet, projecting a holographic map of regime checkpoints, and outlines a covert route. Overhead, the drone's lights flare—a warning. Mira signals Red to move, and Red darts for the edge of the roof, vaulting onto a fire escape as Mira wipes away the digital map and ducks into shadow. The objective: Red receives the secret package and the mission instructions, setting off into the city under threat of immediate pursuit.",
