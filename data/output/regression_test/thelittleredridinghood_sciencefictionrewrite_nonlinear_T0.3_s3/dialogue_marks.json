Axel stands a few meters away, facing the lab's main entrance, his hand hovering near a compact stun baton clipped at his hip. Suddenly, the heavy door slides open with a pneumatic hiss; Wolf enters, moving with mechanical precision, synthetic boots scraping against the tile. Wolf's eyes scan the room, locking onto Red. 'Hand over the drive,' Wolf demands, voice flat and metallic. Axel steps between Red and Wolf, flipping the baton open with a sharp flick, his stance low and defensive. Red glances at Axel, weighing trust as Wolf advances, knocking aside a rolling tray with a calculated sweep of his arm. The tray crashes to the floor, scattering surgical shears and glass ampoules. The hum of a security drone echoes from the corridor, signaling incoming reinforcements. Wolf lunges at Axel, shoving him sideways into a cabinet door, which rattles against its hinges. Red darts left, searching for a path to the emergency exit, her breath fogging in the cold air as she clutches the drive. Axel regains his footing, swinging the baton at Wolf's shoulder, producing a dull clang and a brief flicker of sparks. Wolf pivots, unaffected, and turns his attention back to Red, advancing with relentless focus. Red spots a keypad beside the exit and rushes toward it, fingers fumbling over the slick plastic buttons. The door panel beeps; Wolf surges forward, arm outstretched. Axel intercepts, grappling Wolf's wrist, buying Red just enough time to hit the unlock code. The exit slides open and Red slips through, pulling Axel after her, leaving Wolf momentarily blocked as the door seals with a hydraulic thud.",

She scanned the bay, searching for a clear route to the maintenance hatch as Shuttle Pilot 1, a burly man with a scarred cheek, raised a comm to his mouth and muttered, 'Suspicious movement, sector C. Possible tech runner.' His partner, Shuttle Pilot 2, shifted his weight and tapped the butt of a stun pistol, eyes sweeping the shadows for signs of a target. As a security drone hovered closer, blue lights strobing across the crates, Red slipped a small EMP chip from her belt pouch and pressed it against the drone’s access panel when it drifted within reach. The drone’s lights sputtered and it dropped, clattering to the deck. Alarms blared. From the far end of the bay, a tall figure in a grey utility suit—Wolf in disguise—strode toward the commotion, eyes locked on Red. Wolf’s gait was precise, motion controlled, voice cold as he barked, 'All personnel, stand clear.' Red darted for the side corridor, boots slapping the metal grating, while the pilots ducked for cover and Wolf advanced, calculating the shortest interception path. The outcome: Red disabled a security drone and evaded initial detection, but Wolf identified her location, escalating the pursuit.",

Dr. Willow emerged from the lab, her lab coat smudged with graphite stains, clutching a slim, opaque data drive. She glanced up and down the empty corridor, then pressed the drive into Red's palm. Dr. Willow spoke in a hushed voice, instructing Red to deliver the drive to Grandmother on the planet below. She input a coded destination into Red's wristband, her fingers moving quickly over the screen, and locked eyes with Red, warning her about surveillance drones. Red nodded, slipping the drive into her inner jacket pocket and adjusting her hood to conceal her face. The door behind them hissed shut as Dr. Willow returned to her lab, leaving Red to study the encoded map now glowing on her wristband.

The pilots hesitated, smelling a trick, and one reached for his wrist comm, but Axel stepped forward, flashing a forged clearance badge and muttering, 'Maintenance emergency. Level 3 priority.' The pilots, motivated by the promise of a bounty but wary of official trouble, conferred in low voices. A drone’s scanner locked onto the manifest, lights flickering, but Axel nudged the scanner with a precise tap, triggering a harmless loop in its sensor. The drone drifted past.
