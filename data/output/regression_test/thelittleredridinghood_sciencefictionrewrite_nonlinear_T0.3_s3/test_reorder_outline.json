        "chapter_id": "Chapter 5",
        "title": "Confrontation in the Medical Lab",
        "summary": "With security forces closing in, Red and her grandmother debate whether to destroy the data or attempt a transmission to Dr. Hood on the colony. Choosing to transmit, Red fends off a security drone incursion while her grandmother uploads the files. The pair narrowly escape through a maintenance tunnel as the lab self-destructs to erase all evidence.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Action, Open in Medias Res",
        "narrative_instruction": "Begin with third person limited perspective focused on Red, present tense for immediacy. Do not assume prior knowledge of Red, Axel, or Wolf—introduce them through action, dialogue, and observable details. Establish the high-stakes confrontation as the reader's entry point, using internal monologue sparingly to reveal Red's uncertainty about Axel and the danger posed by Wolf. Withhold deeper backstory, instead letting confusion and tension set the hook.",
        "transition_hint": "Open abruptly with Red and Axel entering the lab under threat; build intrigue by implicit references to prior events (e.g., Red's possession of the chip, Wolf's motivation), but do not explain yet."

        "chapter_id": "Chapter 2",
        "title": "Ambush at the Spaceport",
        "summary": "Red hides among the cargo, overhearing two shuttle pilots discussing a bounty on anyone carrying classified tech. When a routine scan threatens to expose her, Red disables the scanner with a makeshift EMP device, sparking suspicion among the crew. She escapes detection but leaves behind a clue that the pilots report to security.",
        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Escalation, Establish Threat",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, tightly focused on Red. Past tense, maintaining continuity from Chapter 5's present-tense immediacy, but now subtly anchor the timeline as \"earlier.\" Present Red's resourcefulness in crisis, and introduce Wolf's antagonism through action. Reveal Red's character traits through her response to the ambush. Maintain a sense of partial mystery about the mission.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition by having Red, in the aftermath of the lab confrontation, recall the earlier ambush at the spaceport—a sensory trigger or moment of tension in the lab prompts the memory. Use a visual or auditory cue (e.g., the whir of drones) to segue fluidly into the past."

    {
        "chapter_id": "Chapter 1",
        "title": "Red Receives a Coded Mission",
        "summary": "On a bustling orbital colony, teenager Red is summoned by her scientist mother, Dr. Ruby Hood, who entrusts her with a sealed data drive meant for Red’s ailing grandmother on the forbidden surface below. Security bots sweep the area, searching for stolen research, and Red narrowly evades them, choosing to sneak onto a cargo shuttle bound for the surface.",
        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Backstory, Mission Motivation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited from Red's perspective, past tense. Use this chapter to deepen reader understanding of Red's origins, the mission's stakes, and her relationship with Dr. Willow and her grandmother. Layer in Red's emotional motivations and her determination. Avoid referencing Axel or lab events—chronologically, this occurs before her journey begins.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition by concluding Chapter 2's flashback with Red's thoughts drifting further back to the mission's true beginning—her meeting with Dr. Willow. Use an emotional anchor (a sense of duty or a memory of her grandmother) to trigger the next memory."

    {
        "chapter_id": "Chapter 4",
        "title": "Wolf Infiltrates the Colony",
        "summary": "Red reaches her grandmother’s fortified underground lab and warns her of the incoming threat. As Red hands over the data drive, the Wolfbot breaches their defenses. Red and her grandmother coordinate a trap, luring the Wolfbot into a containment chamber and using a plasma field to immobilize it, but not before it broadcasts their location to the authorities.",
        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "Obstacles, Rising Tension",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, with Red as the focal point. Resume the narrative's present after resolving the nested flashbacks (Chapters 2 and 1), now moving forward in time from the end of Chapter 5. Depict Red and Axel working together but still unfamiliar, with trust still being developed. Show Wolf's presence as a looming threat and increase tension through external danger.",
        "transition_hint": "Return to the present by ending the nested flashbacks with Red's resolve crystallizing. Use a physical or environmental cue (alarm blaring, lights flashing in the colony) to snap back to the ongoing action as Red and Axel infiltrate the colony."

        "title": "Sabotage on the Shuttle",
        "summary": "Upon landing, Red is intercepted by a Wolf-class infiltration android disguised as a human, who claims to be a helpful guide. Sensing danger, Red hacks a nearby maintenance drone to distract the android and flees into the irradiated ruins, pursued by the relentless Wolfbot, who is programmed to retrieve the data drive at any cost.",
        "new_order": 5,
        "narrative_role": "Alliance, Character Turning Point",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue with third person limited, past tense from Red's perspective. This chapter occurs after the infiltration but before the lab confrontation, so maintain continuity in the evolving relationship between Red and Axel—trust must be in flux, with pivotal moments of doubt, betrayal, and alliance. Let the collaboration and Axel's change of heart feel earned but tentative.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition from the colony infiltration (Chapter 4) by referencing the tense shuttle journey as the events that forced Red and Axel to rely on each other. Use dialogue or a brief internal reflection to naturally introduce the memory."
