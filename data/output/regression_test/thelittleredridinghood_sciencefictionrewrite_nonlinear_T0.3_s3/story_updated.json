        "plot": "Red presses her back against a refrigerated storage unit, fingers tight around a sealed data drive. Axel stands a few meters away, facing the lab's main entrance, his hand hovering near a compact stun baton clipped at his hip. Suddenly, the heavy door slides open with a pneumatic hiss; Wolf enters, moving with mechanical precision, synthetic boots scraping against the tile. Wolf's eyes scan the room, locking onto Red. 'Hand over the drive,' Wolf demands, voice flat and metallic. Axel steps between Red and Wolf, flipping the baton open with a sharp flick, his stance low and defensive. Red glances at Axel, weighing trust as Wolf advances, knocking aside a rolling tray with a calculated sweep of his arm. The tray crashes to the floor, scattering surgical shears and glass ampoules. The hum of a security drone echoes from the corridor, signaling incoming reinforcements. Wolf lunges at Axel, shoving him sideways into a cabinet door, which rattles against its hinges. Red darts left, searching for a path to the emergency exit, her breath fogging in the cold air as she clutches the drive. Axel regains his footing, swinging the baton at Wolf's shoulder, producing a dull clang and a brief flicker of sparks. Wolf pivots, unaffected, and turns his attention back to Red, advancing with relentless focus. Red spots a keypad beside the exit and rushes toward it, fingers fumbling over the slick plastic buttons. The door panel beeps; Wolf surges forward, arm outstretched. Axel intercepts, grappling Wolf's wrist, buying Red just enough time to hit the unlock code. The exit slides open and Red slips through, pulling Axel after her, leaving Wolf momentarily blocked as the door seals with a hydraulic thud.",

She scanned the bay, searching for a clear route to the maintenance hatch as Shuttle Pilot 1, a burly man with a scarred cheek, raised a comm to his mouth and muttered, 'Suspicious movement, sector C. Possible tech runner.' His partner, Shuttle Pilot 2, shifted his weight and tapped the butt of a stun pistol, eyes sweeping the shadows for signs of a target. As a security drone hovered closer, blue lights strobing across the crates, Red slipped a small EMP chip from her belt pouch and pressed it against the drone’s access panel when it drifted within reach. The drone’s lights sputtered and it dropped, clattering to the deck. Alarms blared. From the far end of the bay, a tall figure in a grey utility suit—Wolf in disguise—strode toward the commotion, eyes locked on Red. Wolf’s gait was precise, motion controlled, voice cold as he barked, 'All personnel, stand clear.' Red darted for the side corridor, boots slapping the metal grating, while the pilots ducked for cover and Wolf advanced, calculating the shortest interception path. The outcome: Red disabled a security drone and evaded initial detection, but Wolf identified her location, escalating the pursuit.",

Dr. Willow emerged from the lab, her lab coat smudged with graphite stains, clutching a slim, opaque data drive. She glanced up and down the empty corridor, then pressed the drive into Red's palm. Speaking in a hushed voice, Dr. Willow emphasized the utmost secrecy of Red's mission, explaining that the drive contains a complete map of the station's core systems—information vital to Grandmother's work and dangerous if intercepted. Red, determined but seeking clarity, asked about the drive's contents and how to safely meet Grandmother. Dr. Willow instructed Red to find Grandmother waiting by the old willow tree near the landing site, wearing a silver cloak, and to use the phrase 'the roots remember' as identification. She warned Red about surveillance, sending silent coordinates to Red's wristband and advising her to move stealthily and avoid detection. Red, slipping the drive into her inner jacket pocket, adjusted her hood and prepared to begin her mission, trusting Willow's guidance and determined to fulfill her task.",

When a security drone flags their trail earlier than expected, Red realizes their planned route is compromised. Axel suggests abandoning the east corridor and rerouting through maintenance, warning they have under three minutes before lockdown. Red decides they must split up to maximize their chances: she will jam the maintenance sensors, while Axel clears the hatch for their escape. Their objective remains to reach the shuttle bay, but now with a riskier, time-critical plan that involves dividing their efforts.",

The pilots, motivated by the bounty but wary of increased security scrutiny, debate whether to help her or turn her in, ultimately agreeing to assist if they can minimize risk and avoid detection. Red produces a detailed manifest and claims to have override codes that could prevent a station-wide lockdown, further convincing the pilots of the seriousness of her mission. Axel, now posing as a supervisor rather than a covert accomplice, scrutinizes Red's paperwork, expressing suspicion about discrepancies, but Red provides plausible explanations and offers to show supporting correspondence. Axel asks Red to stay put while he verifies the information, maintaining a cautious but not overtly adversarial stance. The pilots plan to keep their transponder dark and avoid patrols, ready to abort the operation if anything seems amiss. The alliance between Red, Axel, and the pilots forms out of mutual necessity and distrust, rather than a coordinated ruse, and their cooperation hinges on the perceived threat rather than bounty greed alone.",

The plot has been updated to reflect these changes in character motivation, stance, and interaction."
