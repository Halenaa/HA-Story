# Chapter 5: Confrontation in the Medical Lab

Red presses her back against a refrigerated storage unit, fingers tight around a sealed data drive.

Axel stands a few meters away, facing the lab's main entrance, his hand hovering near a compact stun baton clipped at his hip.

Suddenly, the heavy door slides open with a pneumatic hiss;

Wolf enters, moving with mechanical precision, synthetic boots scraping against the tile.

Wolf's eyes scan the room, locking onto Red.

'Hand over the drive,' Wolf demands, voice flat and metallic.

Wolf steps forward, gloved hand outstretched, his gaze unblinking and cold. "Hand over the drive. Now. You know what happens if you don't." ——Wolf

Axel steps between Red and Wolf, flipping the baton open with a sharp flick, his stance low and defensive.

Red glances at Axel, weighing trust as Wolf advances, knocking aside a rolling tray with a calculated sweep of his arm.

The tray crashes to the floor, scattering surgical shears and glass ampoules.

The hum of a security drone echoes from the corridor, signaling incoming reinforcements.

Wolf lunges at Axel, shoving him sideways into a cabinet door, which rattles against its hinges.

Red darts left, searching for a path to the emergency exit, her breath fogging in the cold air as she clutches the drive.

Axel regains his footing, swinging the baton at Wolf's shoulder, producing a dull clang and a brief flicker of sparks.

Wolf pivots, unaffected, and turns his attention back to Red, advancing with relentless focus.

Red spots a keypad beside the exit and rushes toward it, fingers fumbling over the slick plastic buttons.

The door panel beeps;

Wolf surges forward, arm outstretched.

Axel intercepts, grappling Wolf's wrist, buying Red just enough time to hit the unlock code.

The exit slides open and Red slips through, pulling Axel after her, leaving Wolf momentarily blocked as the door seals with a hydraulic thud.

# Chapter 2: Ambush at the Spaceport

Red crouched behind a crate stamped with the colony's insignia, her gloved hand gripping the sealed data drive inside her jacket.

She scanned the bay, searching for a clear route to the maintenance hatch as Shuttle Pilot 1, a burly man with a scarred cheek, raised a comm to his mouth and muttered, 'Suspicious movement, sector C.

Possible tech runner.

' His partner, Shuttle Pilot 2, shifted his weight and tapped the butt of a stun pistol, eyes sweeping the shadows for signs of a target.

As a security drone hovered closer, blue lights strobing across the crates, Red slipped a small EMP chip from her belt pouch and pressed it against the drone’s access panel when it drifted within reach.

The drone’s lights sputtered and it dropped, clattering to the deck.

Alarms blared.

From the far end of the bay, a tall figure in a grey utility suit—Wolf in disguise—strode toward the commotion, eyes locked on Red.

Wolf’s gait was precise, motion controlled, voice cold as he barked, 'All personnel, stand clear.

' Red darted for the side corridor, boots slapping the metal grating, while the pilots ducked for cover and Wolf advanced, calculating the shortest interception path.

The outcome: Red disabled a security drone and evaded initial detection, but Wolf identified her location, escalating the pursuit.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Coded Mission

Red approached the sealed lab door, boots clinking softly on the grated floor as she paused to scan her wristband at the security panel.

Dr.

Willow emerged from the lab, her lab coat smudged with graphite stains, clutching a slim, opaque data drive.

She glanced up and down the empty corridor, then pressed the drive into Red's palm.

Speaking in a hushed voice, Dr.

Willow emphasized the utmost secrecy of Red's mission, explaining that the drive contains a complete map of the station's core systems—information vital to Grandmother's work and dangerous if intercepted.

Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)Willow leans in closer, her eyes scanning the dim corridor to make sure they're alone, her tone low and urgent. "Red, listen to me carefully—this must be done quietly. The drive contains everything Grandmother needs to finish her work. No one else can know. Go directly to her on the surface, and don’t let it out of your sight. Do you understand how critical this is?" ——Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)

Red clutches the drive tightly, glancing nervously toward the hatch that leads to the planet's surface. "I understand, Willow—I'll make sure Grandmother gets the drive safely, but what exactly is on it that makes it so dangerous?" ——Red

Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)Willow leans in closer, her eyes scanning the corridor for any sign of eavesdroppers. "It's a complete map of the station's core systems—if it falls into the wrong hands, everything we've built here could be lost." ——Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)

Red clutches the drive tighter, eyes searching Willow's face for any hint of doubt or hesitation. "I won't let anyone near it, but how will I recognize Grandmother—do I call her something specific, or will she be expecting me?" ——Red

Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)Willow places the drive into Red's hand, her gaze stern but trusting. "She'll be waiting by the old willow tree near the landing site, wearing a silver cloak—just say 'the roots remember,' and she'll know it's you." ——Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)

Red, determined but seeking clarity, asked about the drive's contents and how to safely meet Grandmother.

Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)Dr. Ruby Hood swiftly taps out a coded sequence on Red's wristband, her eyes flicking to the dark shapes lurking above as she leans in, voice barely above a whisper. "Red, I've sent the coordinates—don't say them out loud. The drones are cycling overhead; any wrong move, they'll be on us in seconds. Keep your head down and trust your wristband." ——Dr. Ruby Hood (Dr. Willow)

RedDr. Hood glances upward, scanning for drone silhouettes, then subtly tilts her head toward a narrow alleyway, signaling Red to get moving. "Stick to the shadows and move only when the lights shift—I'll guide you through the comms, but silence is our only shield now." ——Red

Dr.

Willow instructed Red to find Grandmother waiting by the old willow tree near the landing site, wearing a silver cloak, and to use the phrase 'the roots remember' as identification.

She warned Red about surveillance, sending silent coordinates to Red's wristband and advising her to move stealthily and avoid detection.

Red, slipping the drive into her inner jacket pocket, adjusted her hood and prepared to begin her mission, trusting Willow's guidance and determined to fulfill her task.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Infiltrates the Colony

Red and Axel crouch behind a crate, monitoring the corridor and security drone patterns.

Red notes the precise timing of camera loops and proposes taking the east corridor, moving in the shadows.

As they advance, Red spots a motion sensor activation and quickly adjusts their route, instructing Axel to stay low and alert for changes.

When a security drone flags their trail earlier than expected, Red realizes their planned route is compromised.

Axel suggests abandoning the east corridor and rerouting through maintenance, warning they have under three minutes before lockdown.

Red decides they must split up to maximize their chances: she will jam the maintenance sensors, while Axel clears the hatch for their escape.

Their objective remains to reach the shuttle bay, but now with a riskier, time-critical plan that involves dividing their efforts.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Sabotage on the Shuttle

Red approaches the cargo bay with urgency, directly appealing to Shuttle Pilot 1 for immediate boarding, citing imminent danger to the station.

The pilots, motivated by the bounty but wary of increased security scrutiny, debate whether to help her or turn her in, ultimately agreeing to assist if they can minimize risk and avoid detection.

Shuttle Pilot 1Glances over shoulder at Shuttle Pilot 2, fingers drumming nervously on the ramp control panel. "You seen the update? That bounty just doubled—someone wants them bad. If we’re smart, we’re out before the crowd catches wind. Unless you fancy dodging more than blaster fire." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

Shuttle Pilot 2 glances sharply toward the docking bay, tightening their grip on the comm and nodding once to signal readiness. "We move now, split the cut, and keep our names off the chatter—unless you’re keen on painting targets on both our backs." ——Shuttle Pilot 2

Shuttle Pilot 1 glances over their shoulder, scanning the landing bay for newcomers. "Split works, but we stick to shadows—last thing I need is the Guild sniffing around." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

Red produces a detailed manifest and claims to have override codes that could prevent a station-wide lockdown, further convincing the pilots of the seriousness of her mission.

Axel, now posing as a supervisor rather than a covert accomplice, scrutinizes Red's paperwork, expressing suspicion about discrepancies, but Red provides plausible explanations and offers to show supporting correspondence.

Axel asks Red to stay put while he verifies the information, maintaining a cautious but not overtly adversarial stance.

Red halts just short of the hatch, breath quick and eyes darting past Shuttle Pilot 1, searching for any chance to slip by. "Please, I need to get inside—there’s no time to explain!" ——Red

Shuttle Pilot 1 plants a firm hand on the hatch control, eyes narrowing as they block Red’s way. "Not so fast—nobody boards without clearance, especially not after what happened on Deck 3." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

Red squares her shoulders, voice low and urgent, eyes locked on the pilot as she inches closer to the hatch. "If you don't let me through right now, everyone on this station could be in danger." ——Red

Shuttle Pilot 1 squares their shoulders and tightens their grip on the hatch handle, blocking Red's way. "Danger from what, exactly? Unless you tell me what's going on, I'm not moving." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

Red glances nervously over her shoulder, voice low but urgent, hands clenched tight at her sides. "If I say too much, I risk making things worse—but if you don't let me in, we might not have a station left to argue about." ——Red

Shuttle Pilot 1 narrows their eyes, body tense, one hand hovering near the comm panel to call for backup. "You’re asking me to trust you with everyone’s lives—give me one good reason I should." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

Red holds up a small device, hand trembling but eyes locked on the pilot, daring him to call her bluff. "Because I have the override codes, and if you stall me any longer, the lockdown protocol will trigger and trap us both out here." ——Red

Shuttle Pilot 1 narrows their eyes, but steps aside just enough for Red to reach the hatch, hand hovering over the comm panel as a warning. "Codes or not, if you try anything reckless, I’ll sound the emergency alarm—and then we both answer to Command." ——Shuttle Pilot 1

RedShuttle Pilot 1 steps aside just enough for Red to squeeze past, eyes narrowed and hand hovering near the console. "Fine—but you stay in my line of sight and one wrong move, I pull the alarm." ——Red

The pilots plan to keep their transponder dark and avoid patrols, ready to abort the operation if anything seems amiss.

Red extends the manifest toward Axel, maintaining eye contact and a calm demeanor, though one hand tightens imperceptibly on the folder's edge. "Here's the manifest you requested, Axel. All items are accounted for, with weights and serials cross-checked. If you need any further details, I can walk you through the shipment line by line." ——Red

Axel narrows his eyes, folding his arms as he steps even closer, his gaze fixed on Red for any sign of a slip. "I appreciate the thoroughness, Red, but I can't help noticing these serial numbers don’t match the inventory tags from our last checkpoint—mind explaining that?" ——Axel

Red maintains a calm demeanor, but a slight tightening of their grip on the manifest betrays a flicker of anxiety, while Axel folds his arms and narrows his eyes, leaning in as if daring Red to slip up. "Of course, Axel—there was a last-minute substitution from the supplier, so I updated the manifest accordingly; I can pull up the correspondence if you’d like to see it." ——Red

Axel narrows his eyes, subtly shifting his stance to block Red's path, his hand hovering near his comm—just in case. "That won't be necessary just yet, Red, but I'm going to need you to stay right here while I verify a few things myself." ——Axel

Red keeps their gaze steady on Axel, hands folded calmly atop the manifest, while a faint muscle twitches at their jaw. "Take all the time you need, Axel; I'm not going anywhere." ——Red

The alliance between Red, Axel, and the pilots forms out of mutual necessity and distrust, rather than a coordinated ruse, and their cooperation hinges on the perceived threat rather than bounty greed alone.
