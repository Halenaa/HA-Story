Wolf Unit-9 paused, cocked its head, and began methodically slicing through the last strands of security wire with a retractable blade. Red watched the android's movements, tracking its rhythm, then darted to a busted console under the canopy, activating its manual override. The android pivoted, voice crackling: 'Identify. Surrender the drive.' Red replied, voice low: 'Not happening.' She initiated a rapid system reboot, triggering a burst of warning klaxons and strobing emergency lights. Wolf Unit-9 lunged, metallic limbs scraping across concrete, forcing Red to retreat toward the outpost entrance.",

If you see anything odd—jam their signals first, ask questions later,' Dr. Hood instructed, pressing a battered comm-link into Red's palm.

Using the momentary diversion, Red edged sideways, eyes fixed on the route ahead, searching for gaps in the checkpoint perimeter.
