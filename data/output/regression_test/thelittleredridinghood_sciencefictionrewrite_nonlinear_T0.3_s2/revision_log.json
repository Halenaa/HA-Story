This nuance is not present in the original plot, which casts Wolf Unit-9 as motivated by profit or strategic advantage. The updated plot now incorporates Wolf Unit-9's stated allegiance to the sector's safety, reflecting a more complex, conflicted antagonist whose actions are driven by a perceived duty to protect lives, not just by orders or self-interest.",
