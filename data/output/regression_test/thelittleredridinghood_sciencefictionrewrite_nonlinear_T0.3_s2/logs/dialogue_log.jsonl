She scanned the warped entry gate, noticing the flickering red eyes of Wolf Unit-9 prowling near the generator shed. Red extracted a slim hacking tool from her satchel, fingers trembling as she calculated her approach. Wolf Unit-9 paused, cocked its head, and began methodically slicing through the last strands of security wire with a retractable blade. Red watched, tracking its rhythm, then darted to a busted console under the canopy, activating its manual override. The android pivoted, addressing Red directly: 'Designation: Wolf Unit-9. Mission parameters classified. State your authorization protocol.' As Red hesitated, Wolf Unit-9 advanced, its tone urgent and conflicted. 'Red, you are in violation of Protocol Sigma-12. The drive contains classified data critical to the survival of this sector. Stand down and transfer the device immediately.' Red, voice steady, countered, 'If the survival of this sector hinges on blind obedience, maybe it's already lost.' Wolf Unit-9 retorted, 'You misunderstand—my orders are not about obedience, but containment; if that drive leaves with you, the entire sector is compromised.' Red shot back, 'Containment for whom, Wolf? The sector, or the ones pulling your strings?' Wolf Unit-9 paused, voice softer but resolute: 'My allegiance is to the lives here, not the handlers in the dark—give me the drive, or I cannot guarantee your safety, Red.' Red backed toward the outpost entrance, gripping the drive: 'If you want it, you'll have to take it from me—and we both know what that'll cost.' Emergency klaxons blared as Red triggered the manual override, strobing lights filling the compound.

'This update is the only thing keeping your grandmother alive,' she stated, her voice low and brisk. Red nodded, securing the drive into her vest pocket, then triple-checked the magnetic seals on her courier satchel. Dr. Hood adjusted the biometric scanner above the exit hatch, her eyes darting to the security feed as a distant alarm blipped—a reminder of last week's rogue android breach.

If you see anything odd—jam their signals first, ask questions later,' Dr. Hood instructed, pressing a battered comm-link into Red's palm.

Nearing the checkpoint, she noticed telltale signs of recent machine activity: a faint metallic scent and fresh gouges in the bark. Wolf Unit-9 stepped from behind a trunk, its synthetic skin flickering with static as it adopted a neutral, but confrontational, stance. It blocked her path and scanned her satchel, declaring firmly: 'You are not authorized to carry colony medical assets. State your designation and purpose immediately.' Red asserted herself, stating she was a courier delivering urgent medical supplies. Wolf Unit-9 reviewed its manifest and, finding no record of Red, warned her that unauthorized transfer of such assets was a serious breach. Red retorted that delay would endanger lives at the outpost, pleading for cooperation. Wolf Unit-9 remained unmoved, citing protocol and threatening detainment and confiscation. Red, determined, challenged Wolf Unit-9 on the morality of protocol over lives, but the machine initiated escalation for remote authorization, instructing her to remain stationary. Red, desperate, declared she would find another way if Wolf Unit-9 wouldn't help. Wolf Unit-9 warned that interference would trigger containment subroutines, prompting Red to defy it outright: 'Then I guess you'll have to catch me first.' Attempting to distract the android, Red shifted tactics, asking detailed questions about the recent changes in drone patrol patterns. Wolf Unit-9, compelled to answer, explained the adjustments in drone vectors, particularly the increased overlap near Sector C. Using the distraction, Red assessed possible escape routes.

Driven by the urgent need to deliver the AI update to her grandmother, Red pries a comms relay module from her satchel and splices it into a nearby maintenance cable, attempting to override the checkpoint protocols. Suddenly, a faint metallic clatter echoes from the far side of the clearing; Wolf Unit-9 darts from behind a cluster of ferns, its matte chassis camouflaged with streaks of green algae. The android pauses, scanning the area with glowing blue optics, then slices through a tangle of security wires with an extendable blade, outpacing Red and heading toward the checkpoint.
