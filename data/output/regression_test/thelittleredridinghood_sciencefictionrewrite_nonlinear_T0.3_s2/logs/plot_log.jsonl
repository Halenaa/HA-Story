Wolf Unit-9 paused, cocked its head, and began methodically slicing through the last strands of security wire with a retractable blade. Red watched the android's movements, tracking its rhythm, then darted to a busted console under the canopy, activating its manual override. The android pivoted, voice crackling: 'Identify. Surrender the drive.' Red replied, voice low: 'Not happening.' She initiated a rapid system reboot, triggering a burst of warning klaxons and strobing emergency lights.

Dr. Hood, her posture rigid with urgency, slid a sealed data drive across the bench, its casing warm from recent encryption. She tapped the drive sharply. 'This update is the only thing keeping your grandmother alive,' she stated, her voice low and brisk. Red nodded, securing the drive into her vest pocket, then triple-checked the magnetic seals on her courier satchel. Dr. Hood adjusted the biometric scanner above the exit hatch, her eyes darting to the security feed as a distant alarm blipped—a reminder of last week's rogue android breach. 'Wolf Units are still loose in the sector. Use the forest paths. Trust no one. If you see anything odd—jam their signals first, ask questions later,' Dr. Hood instructed, pressing a battered comm-link into Red's palm.

The drone circled her, scanning her pack and ID chip. Satisfied, it beeped and retreated, mechanical limbs retracting. Red exhaled, adjusted the hood on her jacket, and continued down the moss-lined path, boots squelching in the soft earth.

Red hesitated, quickly palming a decoy transmitter from her pocket and flicking it into a pile of leaves. Distracting Wolf Unit-9 with a question about drone patrol routes, she watched the android pivot, tracking the transmitter's signal. Using the momentary diversion, Red edged sideways, eyes fixed on the route ahead, searching for gaps in the checkpoint perimeter. Wolf Unit-9 extended a manipulator, digging through the leaves, but detected the deception—its head snapped back toward Red, eyes glowing amber. The standoff ended when a distant alarm from the Security Drone AI blared, forcing both Red and Wolf Unit-9 to withdraw: Red darted toward the checkpoint, while Wolf Unit-9 faded into the trees, recalibrating its approach for a later intercept."}}

Suddenly, a faint metallic clatter echoes from the far side of the clearing; Wolf Unit-9 darts from behind a cluster of ferns, its matte chassis camouflaged with streaks of green algae. The android pauses, scanning the area with glowing blue optics, then slices through a tangle of security wires with an extendable blade, outpacing Red and heading toward the checkpoint.
