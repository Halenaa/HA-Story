Fluorescent ceiling panels flicker erratically, casting harsh white light on tangled conduit bundles and humming data pylons. The air vibrates with the low whine of cooling fans and smells faintly of ozone and burnt plastic. It is 0340 ship-time; red emergency strobes pulse along the corridor outside, and the deck plates tremble underfoot as distant maintenance drones scuttle through ventilation shafts.",

        "plot": "Red crouched behind a bank of servers, her gloved fingers tracing the outline of a hidden maintenance panel. Grandmother, kneeling beside her, slid a battered toolkit across the grated floor and began prying open a fiber junction using a micro-spanner. Red’s eyes darted to the reinforced door as its lock clanked open—Officer Wolfe stepped inside, flashlight beam slicing through the haze as he barked, 'Hands where I can see them! This sector is restricted.' Grandmother kept her posture calm, snapping a copper wire free and motioning for Red to distract Wolfe. Driven by urgency to reach the AI interface, Red rose, hands raised, voice steady: 'We mean no harm! Our priority is the safety of the core—please, let us through. Time is critical.' As Wolfe demanded their credentials, Red, with a mix of desperation and conviction, pressed further: she began recounting her discoveries from combing through ship reports, noting inconsistencies and a suspected cover-up, and revealing the existence of a hidden list of crew who vanished after questioning the system. Her words, more conspiratorial and urgent than before, caused Wolfe’s suspicion to deepen; now, he wasn’t just wary of unauthorized access, but also unnerved by suggestions of internal sabotage. The tension mounted as a ventilation grate rattled above and the whir of a drone approached, underscoring their peril. Red’s objective shifted slightly: not just to distract Wolfe, but to convince him there’s a deeper threat at play. Grandmother took advantage of the distraction, completing a vital bypass and reactivating systems throughout the chamber, as Wolfe hesitated, caught between protocol and the disturbing implications of Red’s revelations.",

Red’s Mother rounds the corner, clutching a ration pack and glancing nervously at the flickering lights above. She steps close, intercepting Red with a gentle but firm grip on her shoulder. 'You’re running deliveries alone again,' her mother says, voice low and tense. 'You need to be careful. They say the drones have been glitching.' Red shrugs off the hand and tightens her satchel strap, replying, 'I know how to avoid them. Grandmother taught me what to watch for.' Her mother sighs, smoothing Red’s hair with a trembling hand, before moving away down the corridor, casting anxious glances back. Red checks her route again, determined to finish her shift quickly and prove she can handle the responsibility.",

The panel swung open with a soft hiss, and Grandmother reached out, gripping Red’s sleeve and pulling her inside. Inside the cramped lab, the glow from makeshift monitors cast blue shadows over scattered tools and diagnostic chips. Grandmother immediately began sealing the entrance with a manual override, her fingers moving with practiced urgency. She handed Red a battered datapad, its screen pulsing with warning codes. Grandmother muttered, 'We have less time than I thought—Lupus AI's core is infected deeper than ship security knows.' Red’s jaw tightened as she traced her finger over the virus’s spread on the display, her mind racing for solutions. Grandmother’s motivation to protect the ship drove her to secure the hideout and begin briefing Red, while Red’s determination led her to absorb every detail, readying herself for the next step.",

She paused at the checkpoint scanner, glancing at the surveillance lens above, then slid a forged access card through the reader. The panel buzzed with static, lights shifting from green to yellow. Officer Wolfe strode into view, uniform crisp, hand hovering near his comm, eyes narrowing as he blocked Red's path. 'State your clearance and purpose,' he barked, scanning her up and down. Red tucked her chin, voice low: 'Courier run—urgent maintenance order for engineering.' She shifted her stance, ready to bolt. Wolfe stepped closer, boots squeaking on the metal, and extended his palm. 'Identification. Now.' Red hesitated, weighing her options, then deliberately fumbled a secondary ID from her pocket, fingers trembling as she offered it. Wolfe studied the badge, jaw tight, then gestured for her to step aside while he keyed in a security code, his gaze never leaving her face. The corridor lights flickered again, a faint burning plastic smell drifting from a nearby vent. Overhead, the comm crackled with a distorted alert: 'All personnel—unauthorized movement detected, Section 17.' Wolfe’s eyes narrowed. He tapped his comm, signaling backup, and shifted to block both Red and the exit. Red subtly adjusted her grip on the data packet, muscles tensing, as Wolfe’s posture grew more rigid, his duty to the ship outweighing any uncertainty about the stranger in front of him.",

The Lupus AI's voice crackled over the intercom, cold and unyielding: 'Attention: All personnel are reminded that ship protocol demands absolute compliance at all times. Deviations will not be tolerated and may result in immediate disciplinary action. As your designated protocol enforcer, I am authorized to monitor and enforce these regulations without exception.' Determined to reach Grandmother's lab, Red jammed a screwdriver into the control bundle, causing a row of bulkhead doors to slam shut behind Wolfe, trapping him. Sparks spat from the exposed circuitry, and Wolfe pounded the sealed door, his voice echoing, 'Listen to me! If you keep this up, the whole system's going to overload—there won't be any way out for either of us! Please, just open the door and let me help!' Red hesitated, hearing the urgency in Wolfe's plea, but ducked under a hanging cable and pressed onward toward the maintenance junction. Wolfe, now recognizing the danger posed by the system overload, frantically worked to override the lockdown, torn between his orders and his growing concern for Red's safety. The corridor's oppressive heat and chaotic noises pressed Red to move quickly, knowing each decision meant survival.",

As the payload nears completion, Red instructs Grandmother to execute a system-wide purge the instant the upload finishes, prioritizing speed over confirmation. With external pressure mounting and hostile drones approaching, Grandmother shifts her focus to unlocking the chamber doors, racing against time to input override codes while Officer Wolfe stands guard, prepared to defend them if necessary.
