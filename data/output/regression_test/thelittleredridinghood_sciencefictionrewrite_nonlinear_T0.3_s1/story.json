        "scene": "Chapter 5 opens in the Lupus AI Core, a narrow, hexagonal chamber deep within the ship's engineering deck. Fluorescent ceiling panels flicker erratically, casting harsh white light on tangled conduit bundles and humming data pylons. The air vibrates with the low whine of cooling fans and smells faintly of ozone and burnt plastic. It is 0340 ship-time; red emergency strobes pulse along the corridor outside, and the deck plates tremble underfoot as distant maintenance drones scuttle through ventilation shafts.",

        "plot": "Red crouched behind a bank of servers, her gloved fingers tracing the outline of a hidden maintenance panel. Grandmother, kneeling beside her, slid a battered toolkit across the grated floor and began prying open a fiber junction using a micro-spanner. Red’s eyes darted to the reinforced door as its lock clanked open—Officer Wolfe stepped inside, flashlight beam slicing through the haze as he barked, 'Hands where I can see them! This sector is restricted.' Grandmother kept her posture calm, snapping a copper wire free and motioning for Red to distract Wolfe. Driven by urgency to reach the AI interface, Red rose, hands raised, voice steady: 'We’re trying to keep the core safe. The system’s not what it seems.' Wolfe, gripping his baton, blocked their path and demanded their credentials, intent on securing the compartment. As Red stepped forward, a ventilation grate above rattled—outside, the distorted whir of a drone echoed closer, underscoring the urgency of their unauthorized repairs. Red’s objective: distract Wolfe long enough for Grandmother to reroute the core’s power. The result: Wolfe’s suspicion intensifies, but Red buys precious seconds as Grandmother completes a critical bypass, triggering a hum of reactivated systems throughout the chamber.",

Her courier satchel bumps against her hip as she pauses to scan the security tag—a routine ingrained by her grandmother. Red’s Mother rounds the corner, clutching a ration pack and glancing nervously at the flickering lights above. She steps close, intercepting Red with a gentle but firm grip on her shoulder. 'You’re running deliveries alone again,' her mother says, voice low and tense. 'You need to be careful. They say the drones have been glitching.' Red shrugs off the hand and tightens her satchel strap, replying, 'I know how to avoid them. Grandmother taught me what to watch for.' Her mother sighs, smoothing Red’s hair with a trembling hand, before moving away down the corridor, casting anxious glances back. Red checks her route again, determined to finish her shift quickly and prove she can handle the responsibility.",

The panel swung open with a soft hiss, and Grandmother reached out, gripping Red’s sleeve and pulling her inside. Inside the cramped lab, the glow from makeshift monitors cast blue shadows over scattered tools and diagnostic chips. Grandmother immediately began sealing the entrance with a manual override, her fingers moving with practiced urgency. She handed Red a battered datapad, its screen pulsing with warning codes. Grandmother muttered, 'We have less time than I thought—Lupus AI's core is infected deeper than ship security knows.' Red’s jaw tightened as she traced her finger over the virus’s spread on the display, her mind racing for solutions. Grandmother’s motivation to protect the ship drove her to secure the hideout and begin briefing Red, while Red’s determination led her to absorb every detail, readying herself for the next step.",

She paused at the checkpoint scanner, glancing at the surveillance lens above, then slid a forged access card through the reader. The panel buzzed with static, lights shifting from green to yellow. Officer Wolfe strode into view, uniform crisp, hand hovering near his comm, eyes narrowing as he blocked Red's path. 'State your clearance and purpose,' he barked, scanning her up and down. Red tucked her chin, voice low: 'Courier run—urgent maintenance order for engineering.' She shifted her stance, ready to bolt. Wolfe stepped closer, boots squeaking on the metal, and extended his palm. 'Identification. Now.' Red hesitated, weighing her options, then deliberately fumbled a secondary ID from her pocket, fingers trembling as she offered it. Wolfe studied the badge, jaw tight, then gestured for her to step aside while he keyed in a security code, his gaze never leaving her face. The corridor lights flickered again, a faint burning plastic smell drifting from a nearby vent. Overhead, the comm crackled with a distorted alert: 'All personnel—unauthorized movement detected, Section 17.' Wolfe’s eyes narrowed. He tapped his comm, signaling backup, and shifted to block both Red and the exit. Red subtly adjusted her grip on the data packet, muscles tensing, as Wolfe’s posture grew more rigid, his duty to the ship outweighing any uncertainty about the stranger in front of him.",

She yanked a maintenance panel loose, exposing tangled wires and scorched insulation, searching for a manual override. Wolfe's heavy boots thudded on the grated deck as he swept his flashlight beam across the narrowing passage, calling out, 'Show yourself! Ship protocol demands compliance.' Driven by her need to reach Grandmother's lab, Red jammed a screwdriver into the control bundle, causing a row of bulkhead doors to slam shut behind Wolfe, trapping him momentarily. Sparks spat from the exposed circuitry, and Wolfe pounded the sealed door, his voice echoing, 'You're making this worse!' Red ducked under a hanging cable, skirting the edge of a hissing steam leak, advancing toward the maintenance junction. Her determination pushed her forward, while Wolfe, committed to his duty, struggled to override the lockdown, determined not to let Red out of his sight. The corridor's oppressive heat and chaotic noises pressed Red to move quickly, knowing each decision meant survival.",

Officer Wolfe, pulse rifle raised, scanned the entrance for hostile maintenance drones, pausing to seal the heavy core doors with an emergency override. As Red connected the portable drive—the virus-neutralizing payload—she called out for Grandmother to initiate the upload sequence. Grandmother input a string of security codes, her voice low and urgent, while Wolfe barked a warning as the metallic scrape of drones echoed from the corridor. The objective: upload the virus fix and escape before the corrupted drones breached the chamber. Gran’s trembling hands hovered over the execute key, her motivation clear—to protect Red and the ship at any cost. As the upload bar crawled forward, Red unplugged the drive on Grandmother’s signal, stuffing it into her courier satchel. Wolfe yanked them both toward a maintenance hatch in the wall, his tactical mind focused on extraction. Behind them, the core lights flickered, and the first drone battered the sealed doors, sending a shudder through the deck. The three slipped into the narrow crawlspace, Wolfe slamming the hatch shut behind them, their mission accomplished—for now.",
