Grandmother, kneeling beside her, slid a battered toolkit across the grated floor and began prying open a fiber junction using a micro-spanner. Red’s eyes darted to the reinforced door as its lock clanked open—Officer Wolfe stepped inside, flashlight beam slicing through the haze as he barked, 'Hands where I can see them! This sector is restricted.' Grandmother kept her posture calm, snapping a copper wire free and motioning for Red to distract Wolfe. Driven by urgency to reach the AI interface, Red rose, hands raised, voice steady: 'We’re trying to keep the core safe. The system’s not what it seems.' Wolfe, gripping his baton, blocked their path and demanded their credentials, intent on securing the compartment. As Red stepped forward, a ventilation grate above rattled—outside, the distorted whir of a drone echoed closer, underscoring the urgency of their unauthorized repairs. Red’s objective: distract Wolfe long enough for Grandmother to reroute the core’s power. The result: Wolfe’s suspicion intensifies, but Red buys precious seconds as Grandmother completes a critical bypass, triggering a hum of reactivated systems throughout the chamber."}}

Red tucked her chin, voice low: 'Courier run—urgent maintenance order for engineering.' She shifted her stance, ready to bolt. Wolfe stepped closer, boots squeaking on the metal, and extended his palm. 'Identification. Now.' Red hesitated, weighing her options, then deliberately fumbled a secondary ID from her pocket, fingers trembling as she offered it. Wolfe studied the badge, jaw tight, then gestured for her to step aside while he keyed in a security code, his gaze never leaving her face. The corridor lights flickered again, a faint burning plastic smell drifting from a nearby vent. Overhead, the comm crackled with a distorted alert: 'All personnel—unauthorized movement detected, Section 17.' Wolfe’s eyes narrowed. He tapped his comm, signaling backup, and shifted to block both Red and the exit.
