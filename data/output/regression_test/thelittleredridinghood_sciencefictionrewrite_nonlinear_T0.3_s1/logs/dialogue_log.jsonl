Grandmother, kneeling beside her, slid a battered toolkit across the grated floor and began prying open a fiber junction using a micro-spanner. Red’s eyes darted to the reinforced door as its lock clanked open—Officer Wolfe stepped inside, flashlight beam slicing through the haze as he barked, 'Hands where I can see them! This sector is restricted.' Grandmother kept her posture calm, snapping a copper wire free and motioning for Red to distract Wolfe. Driven by urgency to reach the AI interface, Red rose, hands raised, voice steady: 'We mean no harm! Our priority is the safety of the core—please, let us through. Time is critical.' As Wolfe demanded their credentials, Red, with a mix of desperation and conviction, pressed further: she began recounting her discoveries from combing through ship reports, noting inconsistencies and a suspected cover-up, and revealing the existence of a hidden list of crew who vanished after questioning the system. Her words, more conspiratorial and urgent than before, caused Wolfe’s suspicion to deepen; now, he wasn’t just wary of unauthorized access, but also unnerved by suggestions of internal sabotage. The tension mounted as a ventilation grate rattled above and the whir of a drone approached, underscoring their peril. Red’s objective shifted slightly: not just to distract Wolfe, but to convince him there’s a deeper threat at play. Grandmother took advantage of the distraction, completing a vital bypass and reactivating systems throughout the chamber, as Wolfe hesitated, caught between protocol and the disturbing implications of Red’s revelations."}, "output": {"dialogue": [{"speaker": "Officer Wolfe", "line": "Step away from the panel!

Grandmother immediately began sealing the entrance with a manual override, her fingers moving with practiced urgency. She handed Red a battered datapad, its screen pulsing with warning codes. Grandmother muttered, 'We have less time than I thought—Lupus AI's core is infected deeper than ship security knows.' Red’s jaw tightened as she traced her finger over the virus’s spread on the display, her mind racing for solutions.

Officer Wolfe strode into view, uniform crisp, hand hovering near his comm, eyes narrowing as he blocked Red's path. 'State your clearance and purpose,' he barked, scanning her up and down. Red tucked her chin, voice low: 'Courier run—urgent maintenance order for engineering.' She shifted her stance, ready to bolt. Wolfe stepped closer, boots squeaking on the metal, and extended his palm. 'Identification. Now.' Red hesitated, weighing her options, then deliberately fumbled a secondary ID from her pocket, fingers trembling as she offered it. Wolfe studied the badge, jaw tight, then gestured for her to step aside while he keyed in a security code, his gaze never leaving her face. The corridor lights flickered again, a faint burning plastic smell drifting from a nearby vent. Overhead, the comm crackled with a distorted alert: 'All personnel—unauthorized movement detected, Section 17.' Wolfe’s eyes narrowed. He tapped his comm, signaling backup, and shifted to block both Red and the exit. Red subtly adjusted her grip on the data packet, muscles tensing, as Wolfe’s posture grew more rigid, his duty to the ship outweighing any uncertainty about the stranger in front of him."}, "output": {"dialogue": []}}

Deviations will not be tolerated and may result in immediate disciplinary action. As your designated protocol enforcer, I am authorized to monitor and enforce these regulations without exception.' Determined to reach Grandmother's lab, Red jammed a screwdriver into the control bundle, causing a row of bulkhead doors to slam shut behind Wolfe, trapping him. Sparks spat from the exposed circuitry, and Wolfe pounded the sealed door, his voice echoing, 'Listen to me! If you keep this up, the whole system's going to overload—there won't be any way out for either of us! Please, just open the door and let me help!' Red hesitated, hearing the urgency in Wolfe's plea, but ducked under a hanging cable and pressed onward toward the maintenance junction.
