# Chapter 5: Confrontation in the Core

Red crouched behind a bank of servers, her gloved fingers tracing the outline of a hidden maintenance panel.

Grandmother, kneeling beside her, slid a battered toolkit across the grated floor and began prying open a fiber junction using a micro-spanner.

Red’s eyes darted to the reinforced door as its lock clanked open—Officer Wolfe stepped inside, flashlight beam slicing through the haze as he barked, 'Hands where I can see them!

Officer Wolfe sweeps the flashlight across the dim room, his stance rigid, one hand hovering near his holstered weapon as he scans Red for any sudden movement. "Nobody moves! Hands up—now! I don’t want any trouble, but I’ll put you on the ground if you so much as twitch. Let’s keep this simple. Against the wall, eyes forward!" ——Officer Wolfe

This sector is restricted.

Officer Wolfe steps forward, blocking the entrance and gestures for the individual to stop. "I'm sorry, but this sector is restricted. Access is not permitted beyond this point. Please turn back immediately." ——Officer Wolfe

' Grandmother kept her posture calm, snapping a copper wire free and motioning for Red to distract Wolfe.

Driven by urgency to reach the AI interface, Red rose, hands raised, voice steady: 'We mean no harm!

Red stands tall in front of the AI interface, hands visible and open, projecting calm urgency while making direct eye contact with any sensors or cameras present. "We mean no harm! Our priority is the safety of the core—please, let us through. Time is critical." ——Red

Our priority is the safety of the core—please, let us through.

Red leans closer to the screen, eyes narrowed, scrolling through encrypted files and cross-referencing timestamps, their fingers trembling with a mix of anxiety and adrenaline. "You ever get the feeling they’re only showing us what they want us to see? I combed through the reports again—some of the numbers just don’t add up. It’s like there’s a whole other layer beneath the surface." ——Red

Red glances over their shoulder, lowering their voice as suspicion flickers across their face. "And every time I try to dig deeper, it’s like the trail just vanishes—like someone’s scrubbing the truth before I can get close." ——Red

Red lowers their voice, glancing over their shoulder as they slide a crumpled printout across the table. "But tonight, I found a file they missed—buried so deep it almost felt intentional, like a warning for anyone who goes looking." ——Red

Red glances nervously over their shoulder, clutching the file tightly to their chest. "There’s a list of names—people who disappeared right after questioning the system, and I’m starting to think we’re next if we keep pulling at these threads." ——Red

Time is critical.

' As Wolfe demanded their credentials, Red, with a mix of desperation and conviction, pressed further: she began recounting her discoveries from combing through ship reports, noting inconsistencies and a suspected cover-up, and revealing the existence of a hidden list of crew who vanished after questioning the system.

Her words, more conspiratorial and urgent than before, caused Wolfe’s suspicion to deepen;

now, he wasn’t just wary of unauthorized access, but also unnerved by suggestions of internal sabotage.

The tension mounted as a ventilation grate rattled above and the whir of a drone approached, underscoring their peril.

Red’s objective shifted slightly: not just to distract Wolfe, but to convince him there’s a deeper threat at play.

Grandmother took advantage of the distraction, completing a vital bypass and reactivating systems throughout the chamber, as Wolfe hesitated, caught between protocol and the disturbing implications of Red’s revelations.

----------------------------------------

As Wolfe weighed his options, the chamber’s monitors flickered with unexpected static. In that instant, a new signal pulsed through the core, demanding attention from everyone present. Even as the immediate standoff hung unresolved, Red’s wrist console buzzed urgently—a transmission was coming through, and whatever it contained could shift the balance of everything they thought they knew.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Transmission

Red strides down the corridor, pressing her palm against a cargo hatch to check its seal, feeling the chill metal under her fingers.

Her courier satchel bumps against her hip as she pauses to scan the security tag—a routine ingrained by her grandmother.

Red’s Mother rounds the corner, clutching a ration pack and glancing nervously at the flickering lights above.

She steps close, intercepting Red with a gentle but firm grip on her shoulder.

'You’re running deliveries alone again,' her mother says, voice low and tense.

'You need to be careful.

They say the drones have been glitching.

' Red shrugs off the hand and tightens her satchel strap, replying, 'I know how to avoid them.

Grandmother taught me what to watch for.

' Her mother sighs, smoothing Red’s hair with a trembling hand, before moving away down the corridor, casting anxious glances back.

Red checks her route again, determined to finish her shift quickly and prove she can handle the responsibility.

----------------------------------------

Red waits until her mother disappears around the corner, then slips into the shadowed maintenance duct, heart pounding with anticipation. Each step takes her farther from the safety of her routine and deeper into the labyrinthine underbelly of Lupus. The flickering lights and distant hum of malfunctioning drones serve as reminders of the risk ahead. Still, Red presses on, guided by the encoded map burned into her memory, determined to reach the old service tunnels where her grandmother’s hideout lies hidden from prying eyes.

# Chapter 4: Grandmother’s Hideout

Red pressed her shoulder against the cold bulkhead, scanning the corridor for hostile drones before rapping three times on the faded access panel.

The panel swung open with a soft hiss, and Grandmother reached out, gripping Red’s sleeve and pulling her inside.

Inside the cramped lab, the glow from makeshift monitors cast blue shadows over scattered tools and diagnostic chips.

Grandmother immediately began sealing the entrance with a manual override, her fingers moving with practiced urgency.

She handed Red a battered datapad, its screen pulsing with warning codes.

Grandmother muttered, 'We have less time than I thought—Lupus AI's core is infected deeper than ship security knows.

' Red’s jaw tightened as she traced her finger over the virus’s spread on the display, her mind racing for solutions.

Red leans closer to the display, her eyes scanning the data as she mutters calculations under her breath, determination burning behind her focused glare. "We can’t afford to let this get any worse. There has to be a way to contain it—something we’ve missed, some angle we haven’t considered yet." ——Red

Red leans in, her gaze fierce as she begins pulling up overlapping reports, determination blazing in her eyes. "We need fresh eyes on the data—cross-reference every anomaly, every deviation; I refuse to believe this thing is unstoppable." ——Red

Red leans closer to the display, her fingers flying over the controls as she magnifies the latest cluster, determination etched on her face. "If we dig deeper into the mutation patterns, maybe we’ll find its weakness—there’s always a weak point." ——Red

Grandmother’s motivation to protect the ship drove her to secure the hideout and begin briefing Red, while Red’s determination led her to absorb every detail, readying herself for the next step.

Grandmother locks the final hatch and turns to Red, her eyes sharp, voice low and urgent, handing her a small, battered red box as she speaks. "Red, listen to me carefully. This ship isn’t just metal and wires—it’s years of secrets, and more enemies than friends. I’ve secured every entrance, but we’re not safe unless you know how to spot trouble. You’re clever, but now you need to be vigilant. If anything happens to me, you take the codes in the red box under my bunk, and you don’t trust anyone until you reach the fallback point. Do you understand what’s at stake, Red? This ship carries more than just us—it’s our future." ——Grandmother

Red meets Grandmother’s gaze, steady and resolute, memorizing the location of the red box and mentally mapping her escape route through the ship’s corridors. "I understand, Grandmother—if anything goes wrong, I’ll take the codes and head straight for the fallback point, no hesitation." ——Red

Grandmother kneels beside a hidden panel, pointing out the manual override switches and motioning for Red to memorize their locations. "Good—that resolve will keep you alive, but remember, the ship’s internal sensors can be bypassed from the engineering bay; if alarms fail, trust your instincts and double-check every hatch before moving." ——Grandmother

----------------------------------------

As the last panel slid shut behind them, the echoes of Grandmother’s warnings lingered in Red’s mind, each word sharpening her focus for what lay ahead. The cramped corridors now pulsed with silent urgency, every shadow a possible threat as the hum of approaching footsteps signaled Wolfe’s relentless pursuit. With the data drive secured and no time to spare, Red braced herself—her next move would bring her face to face with danger at the ship’s main checkpoint.

# Chapter 2: Checkpoint Confrontation

Red darted down the narrow passage, boots thumping on grooved deck plates as she hugged the wall, clutching a sealed data packet under her jacket.

She paused at the checkpoint scanner, glancing at the surveillance lens above, then slid a forged access card through the reader.

The panel buzzed with static, lights shifting from green to yellow.

Officer Wolfe strode into view, uniform crisp, hand hovering near his comm, eyes narrowing as he blocked Red's path.

'State your clearance and purpose,' he barked, scanning her up and down.

Red tucked her chin, voice low: 'Courier run—urgent maintenance order for engineering.

' She shifted her stance, ready to bolt.

Wolfe stepped closer, boots squeaking on the metal, and extended his palm.

'Identification.

Now.

' Red hesitated, weighing her options, then deliberately fumbled a secondary ID from her pocket, fingers trembling as she offered it.

Wolfe studied the badge, jaw tight, then gestured for her to step aside while he keyed in a security code, his gaze never leaving her face.

The corridor lights flickered again, a faint burning plastic smell drifting from a nearby vent.

Overhead, the comm crackled with a distorted alert: 'All personnel—unauthorized movement detected, Section 17.

' Wolfe’s eyes narrowed.

He tapped his comm, signaling backup, and shifted to block both Red and the exit.

Red subtly adjusted her grip on the data packet, muscles tensing, as Wolfe’s posture grew more rigid, his duty to the ship outweighing any uncertainty about the stranger in front of him.

----------------------------------------

As tension tightened between them, the distant echo of hurried footsteps signaled that Red’s diversion had drawn more attention than intended. With Wolfe’s backup closing in and the artificial lights flickering ominously overhead, Red seized the opening and vanished into the labyrinth of corridors beyond the checkpoint. Unbeknownst to her, the deeper she pressed into the ship, the more apparent the consequences of her actions became—hallways darkened, alarms pulsed in the walls, and the unmistakable signs of sabotage began to reveal themselves in every shadowed corner.

# Chapter 3: The Sabotaged Corridor

Red crouched low behind a dented cargo crate, her breath quick and shallow as she scanned the corridor for movement.

She yanked a maintenance panel loose, exposing tangled wires and scorched insulation, searching for a manual override.

Wolfe's heavy boots thudded on the grated deck as he swept his flashlight beam across the narrowing passage, calling out, 'Show yourself!

Officer WolfeWolfe's heavy boots thudded on the grated deck as he swept his flashlight beam across the narrowing passage, his jaw clenched and eyes narrowed, every muscle tensed for a sudden confrontation. "Show yourself! I know you're in here—there's nowhere left to run." ——Officer Wolfe

I know you're in here—there's nowhere left to run.

Lupus AI activates protocol enforcement subroutines, scanning for any signs of non-compliance among crew members. "Attention: All personnel are reminded that ship protocol demands absolute compliance at all times. Deviations will not be tolerated and may result in immediate disciplinary action. As your designated protocol enforcer, I am authorized to monitor and enforce these regulations without exception." ——Lupus AI

' The Lupus AI's voice crackled over the intercom, cold and unyielding: 'Attention: All personnel are reminded that ship protocol demands absolute compliance at all times.

Deviations will not be tolerated and may result in immediate disciplinary action.

Officer WolfeWolfe slams his fist against the reinforced metal, his eyes darting to the sparking panels as the lights flicker, sweat beading on his brow from the rising heat and tension. "Listen to me! If you keep this up, the whole system's going to overload—there won't be any way out for either of us! Please, just open the door and let me help!" ——Officer Wolfe

As your designated protocol enforcer, I am authorized to monitor and enforce these regulations without exception.

' Determined to reach Grandmother's lab, Red jammed a screwdriver into the control bundle, causing a row of bulkhead doors to slam shut behind Wolfe, trapping him.

Sparks spat from the exposed circuitry, and Wolfe pounded the sealed door, his voice echoing, 'Listen to me!

If you keep this up, the whole system's going to overload—there won't be any way out for either of us!

Please, just open the door and let me help!

' Red hesitated, hearing the urgency in Wolfe's plea, but ducked under a hanging cable and pressed onward toward the maintenance junction.

Wolfe, now recognizing the danger posed by the system overload, frantically worked to override the lockdown, torn between his orders and his growing concern for Red's safety.

The corridor's oppressive heat and chaotic noises pressed Red to move quickly, knowing each decision meant survival.

----------------------------------------

As the alarms faded into the distance behind her, Red’s mind raced ahead to the task that awaited at the next terminal—a desperate upload that could determine everything. Meanwhile, Wolfe’s footsteps echoed in pursuit, both of them propelled toward the inevitable confrontation that would follow in the aftermath of the corridor’s chaos.

# Chapter 6: Upload and Escape

Red and Grandmother work together at the exposed server port to upload the virus-neutralizing payload, but encounter unexpected complications as the virus mutates faster than anticipated.

Red’s breath quickens as she yanks the cable, sparks flying. She glances up at Grandmother, searching her face for reassurance while her hands tremble over the exposed circuitry. "Grandmother, the virus is mutating faster than your models predicted—if I don’t reroute this node in the next thirty seconds, we’ll lose the quarantine and the entire network goes dark." ——Red

Grandmother leans closer, her eyes flicking between the datapad’s pulsing red alerts and Red’s trembling gloves, urgency tightening her voice. "Steady your hands, Red—crosswire the fourth and seventh pins, then initiate the override, or every system we've protected falls to the infection." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates, sweat beading at her temple as she hovers the cable over the exposed pins, glancing up at Grandmother for reassurance. "Red: If I misalign these by even a hair, the surge could fry the entire relay—are you sure the override subroutine isn’t corrupted?" ——Red

Grandmother’s voice trembles just slightly as she glances from the datapad to Red’s hands, her knuckles white where she grips the battered device. "The override is clean—I triple-checked the hash before we started, so trust the code and trust yourself, but move—there’s only eighteen seconds left." ——Grandmother

Red’s breath hitched as she bridged the pins, a bead of sweat tracing her temple while Grandmother’s eyes flicked between the timer and Red’s trembling hands. "Red: All right—initiating override now, but if the feedback loop spikes, we’ll have milliseconds to contain the breach." ——Red

Grandmother leans closer over Red's shoulder, her eyes flicking between the datapad’s pulsing red alert and the exposed server as her knuckles whiten around the edge of the console. "Grandmother: Watch for the status lights—if they flicker amber, reroute power through the auxiliary bus immediately or the virus will cascade into the mainframe." ——Grandmother

Red's hands blur across the exposed circuitry, sweat beading at her brow as she yanks a secondary cable into place, eyes darting between the blinking lights and Grandmother's anxious, calculating gaze. "Red: Understood—status lights steady so far, but I see a faint flicker on the north relay—switching power to auxiliary now!" ——Red

Red must rapidly reroute nodes and reinforce firewalls to stabilize the network, with Grandmother providing technical guidance and countermeasures in real time.

The upload sequence is tense, requiring split-second decisions to reroute power and escalate protocols.

Red snaps the portable drive into the terminal, her fingers shaking with urgency, then looks up at the main console, waiting for Grandmother's response. "Drive's in—payload is ready. Grandmother, start the upload now! We don't have much time." ——Red

Grandmother begins the upload process, monitors the transfer rate, and provides real-time progress feedback to Red. "Acknowledged, Red—initiating upload sequence; status: payload transfer at fourteen percent and climbing—stay sharp." ——Grandmother

Red scans the surrounding consoles, fingers poised over manual overrides, eyes flicking to Grandmother's status readout. "I'm monitoring for interference—let me know the second you see any anomaly, Grandmother." ——Red

Grandmother routes additional resources to stabilize the upload and activates diagnostic protocols to monitor for threats. "Understood, Red—payload transfer at twenty-seven percent; no anomalies detected yet, but system pressure is rising—preparing countermeasures." ——Grandmother

Red tightens her grip on the console, eyes flicking between status lights and security feeds. "Stay on those countermeasures, Grandmother—we can’t afford a breach this close to halfway." ——Red

Grandmother diverts upload traffic through secure backup channels, intensifying monitoring protocols. "Payload transfer at forty-three percent, Red—countermeasures holding, but external probes detected on subnet four; rerouting data flow for integrity." ——Grandmother

Red rapidly deploys additional security protocols while keeping a close watch on the payload progress bar. "Copy that, Grandmother—I'm locking down subnet four and reinforcing firewalls; keep the transfer steady, we’re almost at the tipping point." ——Red

Grandmother monitors network integrity and prepares to deploy advanced defensive protocols as the transfer progresses. "Payload at fifty-eight percent, Red—reroute successful, transfer stable, but external pressure intensifying; stay ready for rapid protocol escalation." ——Grandmother

Red rapidly configures additional security layers, eyes flicking between data streams and firewall alerts as she coordinates with Grandmother. "Grandmother, prioritize core system shields and prep emergency purge protocols—we're not letting anything through while the payload finishes." ——Red

Grandmother escalates system defenses and closely monitors for any breach attempts as the upload nears completion. "Core shields prioritized and emergency purge protocols on standby, Red—payload transfer at seventy-two percent and holding strong; alert level elevated to critical." ——Grandmother

RedGrandmother reinforces defensive systems and closely monitors payload transfer and external threats. "Seventy-eight percent, Red—external pressure spiking but shields holding; purge protocols primed and ready on your mark." ——Red

Grandmother diverts additional resources to maintain shield integrity and closely monitors for any sign of breach as the upload nears completion. "Acknowledged, Red—payload transfer at eighty-six percent; shields at maximum capacity, all purge systems armed and on your command." ——Grandmother

Red braces at the console, eyes locked on the progress bar as her fingers hover over the purge command. "Almost there—Grandmother, hold shields at full and stand by to initiate purge on my signal; we're pushing to one hundred percent now." ——Red

Grandmother diverts all available resources to shield integrity and monitors the payload's progress, hand poised over the purge command interface. "Affirmative, Red—payload transfer at ninety-four percent; shields holding, purge protocol standing by for your go—ready when you are." ——Grandmother

Red grips the console, eyes fixed on the transfer status as the final percentage ticks upward. "Grandmother, execute purge the instant we hit one hundred—do not wait for confirmation!" ——Red

Grandmother monitors the transfer countdown, finger poised over the purge command, ready to deploy the emergency cleanse the moment the progress bar hits one hundred percent. "Understood, Red—payload transfer at ninety-nine percent—purge protocol primed—finalizing upload now; standby for immediate system cleanse." ——Grandmother

Grandmother triggers the purge protocol the instant the transfer hits one hundred percent, flooding the system with neutralizing code as alarms blare. "Payload complete—initiating system-wide purge now, Red; hold fast, cleansing sequence engaged." ——Grandmother

As the payload nears completion, Red instructs Grandmother to execute a system-wide purge the instant the upload finishes, prioritizing speed over confirmation.

Grandmother's hands tremble as she quickly types the final digits into the security panel, her breath coming in short, sharp bursts. The metallic scrape of drone limbs grows louder, echoing through the narrow corridor behind them. "Hold still, Wolfe—I need another second! If I don't get this last code in, the lockdown won't release and we won't make it to the safe room. Just a little more time—please!" ——Grandmother

Officer WolfeWolfe plants himself between Grandmother and the door, hackles raised, as the metallic drone whirring grows louder. "They're right outside, Grandmother—hurry, or I'll have to hold them off myself!" ——Officer Wolfe

Grandmother's hands tremble as she enters the final code, sweat beading on her brow, while Wolfe presses his back to the door, weapon drawn, eyes darting as the drone shadows flicker beneath the threshold. "Almost there—just one more digit and the override should disengage, but if I slip up now, the whole system will lock us in for good!" ——Grandmother

Officer Wolfe braces himself between Grandmother and the door, weapon drawn, as red warning lights flicker and the drone shadows grow larger in the corridor. "I can hear their servos whining—Grandmother, now or never!" ——Officer Wolfe

With external pressure mounting and hostile drones approaching, Grandmother shifts her focus to unlocking the chamber doors, racing against time to input override codes while Officer Wolfe stands guard, prepared to defend them if necessary.

The lockdown is released at the last moment, allowing Red to secure the drive and the trio to escape through the maintenance hatch just as the drones breach the outer doors.

----------------------------------------

As the echoes of alarms faded behind them, the trio emerged into the narrow corridors of the facility, hearts pounding with adrenaline and relief. Every hurried footstep carried the weight of Wolfe’s sacrifice, reshaping the fragile trust between them. With the immediate threat behind them but uncertainty ahead, Red, Grandmother, and their unexpected ally faced the consequences of their choices—and the new alliances forged in the crucible of escape.

# Chapter 7: Aftermath and Alliance

Red crouched beside a scorched access panel, her gloved fingers prying loose a melted relay as Grandmother handed her a diagnostic tool from a battered kit.

Sparks popped and fizzed as Grandmother rewired a critical circuit, murmuring instructions.

Grandmother leans over the open panel, deft fingers twisting wires with practiced precision as she guides the connection into place, eyes narrowed in concentration amid the crackle of electricity. "Now, keep steady, dear hands—blue wire to terminal four, just as I taught you. Don't let the sparks distract you; that's only the old girl complaining. There, see? The current’s flowing just right." ——Grandmother

Grandmother steadies her breath, her fingers expertly guiding the tiny component as she aligns it with the humming board. "Next, we’ll nudge the resistor into place—careful now, it’s delicate, but a gentle touch coaxes even stubborn circuits to behave." ——Grandmother

GrandmotherShe tightens the connector with a practiced flick, her eyes narrowing in satisfaction as the circuit hums steadily. "There we are—now, a firm twist on the connector, mind you, and this whole contraption will sing like it did in '57." ——Grandmother

Red scanned the console's flickering display, inputting override codes while sweat beaded at her brow despite the chill.

As the panel whirred back to life, Grandmother leaned in, quietly instructing Red to prepare a status report for Security—her tone brisk, her eyes scanning the corridor for threats.

Grandmother leans closer to Red, her voice low but firm, while her gaze sweeps the corridor for any sign of movement. "Red, quickly—initiate a status report for Security. We need eyes on every entry point. Stay alert; something feels off." ——Grandmother

Red's fingers hover over the console, eyes darting to the shadows at the far end of the corridor. "Understood, Grandmother—compiling the status report now; should I flag any irregularities immediately or wait for your signal?" ——Red

Grandmother steps closer to the panel, scanning the surveillance feeds, her posture tense and watchful. "Flag anything unusual right away, Red—no delays; I'll monitor the corridor while you work." ——Grandmother

Their actions—repairing, instructing, watching—were driven by their shared determination to stabilize the ship and shield each other from further harm.

----------------------------------------

Side by side, as the ship’s systems hummed back to life and the corridor lights flickered steady, Red and Grandmother stood ready—not just to face what came next, but to meet it together, their alliance forged in ash and hope.
