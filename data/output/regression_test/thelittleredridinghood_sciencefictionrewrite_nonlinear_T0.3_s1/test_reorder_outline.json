        "title": "Confrontation in the Core",
        "summary": "Red and Grandmother break into the AI core, only to be intercepted by Wolfe, who demands answers. Red convinces Wolfe the threat is real by showing evidence of the AI virus. Wolfe must choose: arrest Red and Grandmother or help them stop the virus before it takes over the ship.",

        "narrative_role": "Inciting Incident, In Media Res",
        "narrative_instruction": "Begin the novel with a third person limited perspective (focused on Red) in past tense, dropping the reader directly into the high-stakes confrontation in the AI core. Introduce Red and Grandmother as a team with urgent purpose, but avoid explicit exposition of their relationship—let their dialogue and actions hint at their connection. Introduce Wolfe as an antagonistic force, unfamiliar with Red. Carefully seed subtle references to events and relationships that will be clarified later through flashbacks.",
        "transition_hint": "Conclude the chapter with Wolfe demanding answers from Red, then use Red's anxiety and memory triggers as a springboard to transition into her recollection of how she arrived at this moment."

Establish Red's relationship with her mother and grandmother, her sense of duty, and her motivations. Carefully layer in details that clarify the urgency and stakes introduced in Chapter 5, but do not reveal knowledge Red could only have gained later.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with a line such as 'Just hours earlier...' or use Red's inner monologue to trigger the recollection, smoothly signaling the start of a flashback."

        "narrative_role": "Tension Escalation, Pursuit Trigger",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited (Red), past tense. Resume direct chronological narrative as Red tries to evade security.
