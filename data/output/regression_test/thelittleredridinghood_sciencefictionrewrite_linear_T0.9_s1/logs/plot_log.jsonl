She receives an encrypted data package meant for her grandmother, a retired scientist living in an isolated lunar outpost. Red accepts the mission, understanding the importance of keeping the data out of corporate hands."}}, "output": {"plot": "Dr. Hood slides a sealed data chip into a hidden compartment in Red’s chest, her hands moving quickly but precisely as she double-checks the latch. Red stands still, sensors flickering as she scans the room for listening devices. Dr. Hood whispers urgent instructions, detailing the route through the city and the code phrase for contacting Grandmother. Red asks pointed questions about evasion tactics, flexing her servos and testing her cloaking subroutine as Dr. Hood hands her a forged transit pass and a compact toolkit. Their conversation is interrupted by an alert on Dr. Hood’s console—security sweep scheduled in ten minutes—prompting Dr. Hood to usher Red toward the maintenance hatch leading to the service corridors. Red nods, repeating her mother’s instructions before slipping through the hatch, footsteps echoing off cold metal grating."}}

Wolfe interrogates Red about her route and cargo, but Red deflects his questions and narrowly escapes after a brief chase through the docking bays."}}, "output": {"plot": "Red glides quickly through the crowded concourse, her servos whirring softly as she dodges a pair of freight loaders, her optic sensors flicking to scan for threats. She pauses near a maintenance hatch by Docking Bay 7, where the Docking Bay Mechanic—grease-stained jumpsuit, hands busy repairing a hover-cart—glances up as she approaches. Red transmits a coded request for access to the restricted launch pad, her voice modulator low: 'Urgent courier run—family cargo, authorization B-4-9.' The Mechanic, motivated by a quiet desire to help and avoid trouble, wipes his hands and quickly types a bypass code into the access panel, glancing nervously over his shoulder. He mutters, 'Didn’t see you, didn’t hear a thing. Go quick—security’s jumpy tonight.' Red nods, thanks him with a quick chirp, and slips through the hatch as the distant clatter of boots echoes down the concourse, signaling approaching danger."}}

The Docking Bay Mechanic, clad in grease-streaked overalls and clutching a battered toolkit, leans over her shoulder, offering a replacement fuse while glancing nervously at the status monitors. Red tightens the last bolt, then pivots to scan the loading bay doors, aware of her mission's urgency. The mechanic wipes sweat from his brow and mutters, 'You got someone after you? Ship's logs flagged a security alert.' Red, voice low and precise, replies, 'Just help me bypass docking protocols. No questions.' Together, they override the lock, the metallic tang of ozone thick in the recycled air, and the bay doors hiss open, revealing the lunar outpost's stark landing grid. Their swift teamwork restores power, allowing Red to slip from the ship undetected, while the mechanic erases the evidence of her arrival from the logs."}}

Wolfe strides down the corridor, boots striking the metal floor with deliberate force, his cybernetic eye sweeping for heat signatures. He pauses, pressing a gloved hand to the wall to trigger his scanner, then calls out, 'You can't hide forever, Courier. Hand over the data.' Red flicks a comm-link, transmitting a silent distress signal to her grandmother, while her other hand unscrews the access panel to reroute the security lock. Wolfe advances, drawing a compact stunner, ready to intercept. The scene ends with Red slipping through the unlocked door as Wolfe lunges, missing her by inches and triggering an alarm that echoes through the outpost."}}
