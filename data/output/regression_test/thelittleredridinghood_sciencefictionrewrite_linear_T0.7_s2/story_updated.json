The Elder Tech Council materializes on a nearby screen, but instead of issuing direct instructions, their message is more reflective and cautionary: they acknowledge Dr. Ada Marrow’s continued presence and influence in the Outlands, noting that her actions carry weight and could affect the balance of power. They remind her (and by extension, Red) that loyalty to the Council supersedes personal motives, and that they will be monitoring developments closely, prepared to intervene if necessary. Red, determined and focused, completes her final systems check—scanning her route, verifying cloaking, securing communications, and confirming the core’s status. She expresses her intent to keep the mission efficient and uneventful, then mounts her hoverbike to begin her journey. The Council logs her departure and continues surveillance, recognizing that events in the Outlands may have wider implications than a simple delivery.",

The drone’s lens aperture narrows, emitting a blue scan-line over Red’s frame. Its speaker crackles, 'Courier credentials detected. Declare package contents.' Red, voice low and steady, replies, 'Council delivery: tech components, priority clearance.' The drone hovers closer, its armature brushing the satchel, sensors ticking. Satisfied, it snaps back, 'Proceed. Any deviation will trigger detainment.' Red nods and strides past the barrier, boots splashing through puddles as she vanishes into the misty Outlands.",

Wolf emerges from the shadows, cloak dripping rain, metal fingers flexing as he intercepts her path. He raises an EMP emitter, his voice low and calculated: 'Courier, give me the core. Machines belong to machines.' However, instead of proceeding immediately to aggression, Wolf pauses, launching into a philosophical monologue about the nature of machines, boundaries, and belonging. He questions whether the division between humans and machines is a form of dignity or simply loneliness, revealing a moment of internal conflict. Red uses this distraction to launch an encrypted distress ping to her grandmother and prepares her next move. Wolf, regaining his focus, commands his android pack to fan out and hunt, his tactical mind reasserting itself. The android pack responds, adjusting their sensors and formation as Wolf personally monitors Red’s escape. Red triggers a smoke grenade, filling the alley with vapor, and vanishes into the swirling fog. Wolf, still introspective but relentless, scans for her escape signature and commands, 'She won't get far.'",

Red straightens, displays her Elder Tech badge, and speaks with urgency: 'I’m here for Dr. Marrow. Access is required immediately—Elder Tech authorization. If you have questions, take them up with Central after I’m inside.' Her voice wavers as she pleads, 'Please, you have to let me in! I don't have anywhere else to go—it's not safe out here!' The bot’s ocular lens flickers, servos whining as it processes her credentials. Its protective programming activates, announcing, 'Alert: Unauthorized access not permitted. Facility compromised. Protective protocol engaged. For your safety, passage is denied until threat is neutralized.' The bot continues, 'The location of Marrow remains unconfirmed. Initiating sector-wide scan protocols.' Red, frustration and fear evident, insists, 'I can't waste another minute. Every second she's out there alone, the chances of finding her slip away. I have to do this—no matter what it takes. She's the only family I have left, and I won't let fear keep me from bringing her home.' The bot continues to scan, reporting signal interference and escalating protocols. At last, Red tries a different approach, stating, 'Understood. Standing down protocols initiated. However, before I upload the security logs, may I ask: for what purpose will they be used? There are sensitive entries that could compromise ongoing operations. I need confirmation of data handling procedures.' The bot hesitates, assessing her request and the security risks. After a tense pause, it ejects a data chip into Red's waiting palm. She pockets the chip and scans the horizon, already plotting her next move.",

Red darts sideways, boots scraping on wet gravel, and hurls a flash-sphere towards Wolf. Wolf ducks, shielding his sensors, and growls, 'You can't run forever, courier. Hand over the core.' Instead of a terse exchange, Red and Wolf engage in a tense negotiation, revealing personal stakes: Wolf admits the AI core is key to a promise he made, while Red refuses to surrender it without proof of Wolf's resolve. Their conversation exposes mutual understanding and respect, even as threats escalate. Wolf signals his pack through a subsonic ping, summoning backup, but now the hunt is laced with personal challenge—both determined to prove their worth and motivations. The objective remains: Wolf tries to trap Red and seize the AI core; Red attempts to evade and reach the highway exit, but their cat-and-mouse game now carries emotional weight. Outcome: Wolf’s jamming disrupts Red’s comms; she escapes the initial trap, forcing Wolf to call in his android pack to close off her escape routes, but the clash is now driven by promises, pride, and personal history as much as by the mission.",

Red, wary after previous incidents, voices her concerns about new security upgrades and demands transparency before proceeding further. Grandmother, equally cautious, insists on handling the biometric seal herself and reassures Red that only trusted individuals are inside the bunker. The exchange is tense, with Red making it clear she will leave if anything feels off, and Grandmother warning her that the contents of the case may complicate any attempt to walk away.
