A projection of the Elder Tech Council materializes on a nearby screen, issuing strict instructions: 'Deliver the core to Dr. Ada Marrow in the Outlands—no deviations.' Red scans her delivery route on her wrist interface, calibrates her cloaking systems, and confirms the mission. The Council, motivated to maintain control over AI technology, authorizes a security override, unlocking the outer gate. Red, driven by her desire to both protect her family and earn her upgrade, steps onto her hoverbike and accelerates through the depot doors, the cold morning wind biting against her polymer skin. The Council watches her departure, logging her progress in their surveillance system."}}

She scans her forged Council pass at the checkpoint terminal, glancing up as the Border Patrol Drone drops from its rail with a mechanical whir. The drone’s lens aperture narrows, emitting a blue scan-line over Red’s frame. Its speaker crackles, 'Courier credentials detected. Declare package contents.' Red, voice low and steady, replies, 'Council delivery: tech components, priority clearance.' The drone hovers closer, its armature brushing the satchel, sensors ticking. Satisfied, it snaps back, 'Proceed. Any deviation will trigger detainment.' Red nods and strides past the barrier, boots splashing through puddles as she vanishes into the misty Outlands."}}

She darts behind a rusted power transformer, scanning for patrols while her HUD flickers with hacked security feeds. Wolf emerges from the shadows, cloak dripping rain, metal fingers flexing as he intercepts her path. He raises an EMP emitter, voice low and calculated: 'Courier, give me the core. Machines belong to machines.' Red narrows her eyes, recalibrates her grip, and launches an encrypted distress ping to her grandmother while sidestepping Wolf's approach. Wolf lunges, slicing the air with a retractable blade, but Red pivots, using her magnetic boots to scale the perimeter fence. Wolf hacks a nearby streetlamp, plunging the area into darkness, and signals his android pack to encircle. Red, driven by her mission to protect her family and deliver the core, triggers a smoke grenade, filling the alley with choking vapor and vanishes into the swirling fog. Wolf scans for her escape signature, teeth bared in a predatory grin, and commands, 'Fan out. She won't get far.'"}}

She scans the area, her optics adjusting to the shifting light, and tries the entry code. The panel flashes red. Inside the bunker, the Council Security Bot emits a sputtering alarm, its voice module glitching: 'Intruder—state credentials.' Red straightens, displays her Elder Tech badge, and speaks tersely: 'I’m here for Dr. Marrow. Let me in.' The bot’s ocular lens flickers, its servos whining as it attempts to process her credentials, but smoke curls from a damaged access port—evidence of a recent struggle. Red kneels, prying open a maintenance panel with her multitool, searching for signs of forced entry. Her fingers brush against scorched wires and a torn scrap of synthetic fabric. The bot, following its protective programming, shudders forward to block her path: 'Facility compromised. Dr. Marrow—location unknown.' Red rises, determination etched in her voice: 'I need to find her. Stand down and upload your security logs.' The bot hesitates, then ejects a data chip into Red's waiting palm. She pockets the chip and scans the horizon, already plotting her next move."}}

She detects two: one approaching, one stationary. Wolf steps into the open, servos humming, his optics gleaming blue in the gathering darkness.

Wolf ducks, shielding his sensors, and growls, 'You can't run forever, courier. Hand over the core.' Red slides behind a broken vending machine, voice clipped as she replies, 'Not a chance, Wolf. You want it? Come and get it.' Wolf signals his pack through a subsonic ping, summoning backup as he advances, his footsteps ringing against the concrete. The objective: Wolf tries to trap Red and seize the AI core; Red attempts to evade and reach the highway exit. Outcome: Wolf’s jamming disrupts Red’s comms, but she escapes the initial trap, forcing Wolf to call in his android pack to close off her escape routes."}}

She grips the insulated case containing the AI core, her delivery protocols running a perimeter check.

She approaches Red quickly, examining her for damage and inspecting the AI core. As Red hands over the case, Grandmother unlocks the biometric seal, checking the contents and then gesturing for Red to follow her inside. The two move toward the bunker entrance, intent on securing the AI core before Wolf’s pack can track their location. The scene ends as the blast door slides shut behind them, isolating the pair within Grandmother’s reinforced shelter."}}

'Ada, I need a distraction—now!' Wolf's voice booms, metallic and calm: 'You can’t outrun us, Red. Hand over the core, and your upgrades will be legendary.' Red hurls a flare module into the air, blinding Wolf’s nearest scout and sprinting toward the relay’s maintenance hatch. Wolf orders his pack, 'Intercept from the west channel. Don’t let her reach the bunker.' The androids converge, their metal feet thudding on the wet ground. Red slides into the maintenance hatch, slamming it behind her as the relay station's internal lights flicker. The objective: Red must evade Wolf's pack and secure access to her grandmother’s hidden bunker. Result: Red successfully evades the first assault, but Wolf’s pack breaches the outer perimeter, escalating the confrontation."}}
