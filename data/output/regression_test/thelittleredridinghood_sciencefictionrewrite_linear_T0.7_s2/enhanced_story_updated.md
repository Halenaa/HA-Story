# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Mission

Red stands at attention by a loading bay, her synthetic joints whirring as she checks the insulated canister containing the rare AI core.

The Elder Tech Council materializes on a nearby screen, but instead of issuing direct instructions, their message is more reflective and cautionary: they acknowledge Dr.

Ada Marrow’s continued presence and influence in the Outlands, noting that her actions carry weight and could affect the balance of power.

Elder Tech CouncilA holographic seal of the Elder Tech Council flickers to life, broadcasting this message to all relevant listening posts and agents in the Outlands. "The Council acknowledges Ada Marrow’s presence in the Outlands. Her movements, though unorthodox, have not yet diverged from the parameters of her assigned directive. We remain vigilant, for the Outlands are a crucible—harsh and unpredictable. Ada’s actions there carry significance beyond her own objectives; they risk stirring dormant powers and shifting the balance we have long maintained. The Council expects her to proceed with caution, to remember that her loyalty is not only to her cause but to the greater structure we uphold. We will watch, and we will intervene only if necessity demands." ——Elder Tech Council

They remind her (and by extension, Red) that loyalty to the Council supersedes personal motives, and that they will be monitoring developments closely, prepared to intervene if necessary.

Red taps through her wrist interface, eyes narrowed in concentration as each system blinks green. She draws a steady breath, shoulders squared, ready to step into the shadows and begin her route. "All right, route scanned and mapped. Cloaking integrity at 100%. Communications channel secure. Package status—stable and sealed. Let’s make this clean and quick. No surprises today." ——Red

Red, determined and focused, completes her final systems check—scanning her route, verifying cloaking, securing communications, and confirming the core’s status.

She expresses her intent to keep the mission efficient and uneventful, then mounts her hoverbike to begin her journey.

The Council logs her departure and continues surveillance, recognizing that events in the Outlands may have wider implications than a simple delivery.

----------------------------------------

As Red speeds away from the Council compound, the city’s polished towers soon give way to the fractured outskirts. With every kilometer, the familiar hum of civilization fades, replaced by the unpredictable silence of the borderlands. Ahead, the boundary known as the Forbidden Zone looms—a fractured landscape where technology and law have long since unraveled. As she approaches the checkpoint, Red tightens her grip on the handlebars, fully aware that the true test of her mission is about to begin.

# Chapter 2: Entering the Forbidden Zone

Red, her jacket hood drawn up against the rain, steps up to the steel gate, clutching a sealed courier satchel.

She scans her forged Council pass at the checkpoint terminal, glancing up as the Border Patrol Drone drops from its rail with a mechanical whir.

The drone’s lens aperture narrows, emitting a blue scan-line over Red’s frame.

Its speaker crackles, 'Courier credentials detected.

Border Patrol Drone hovers closer, sensors focusing on the courier, lights pulsing as it scans for further identification. "Courier credentials detected. State your designation and declare the nature of your cargo for verification." ——Border Patrol Drone

Declare package contents.

Border Patrol DroneDrone hovers in observation mode, scanning package exterior for preliminary data. "Attention: You are approaching a secured border checkpoint. Please declare the contents of your package for inspection. Failure to accurately declare all items may result in inspection delays and possible penalties. Awaiting your response." ——Border Patrol Drone

' Red, voice low and steady, replies, 'Council delivery: tech components, priority clearance.

Red holds out a datapad displaying the official council insignia and a digital clearance code, maintaining unwavering eye contact with the unseen recipient. "Council delivery: tech components, priority clearance. Orders are time-sensitive; the manifest is stamped with the High Council’s seal. Stand aside and verify if you need, but this shipment must reach Sector Six without delay." ——Red

' The drone hovers closer, its armature brushing the satchel, sensors ticking.

Satisfied, it snaps back, 'Proceed.

Border Patrol DroneThe drone hovers momentarily, its sensors retracting after a thorough scan, then emits a green status light signifying clearance. "Inspection complete. All credentials verified. You are authorized to proceed beyond this checkpoint." ——Border Patrol Drone

Any deviation will trigger detainment.

Border Patrol DroneActivates scanning sensors, begins monitoring pathway adherence. "Attention: You are now entering a restricted border zone. All individuals must remain within the designated pathway and comply with all instructions. Any deviation from the established protocol will result in immediate detainment. You are under continuous surveillance." ——Border Patrol Drone

' Red nods and strides past the barrier, boots splashing through puddles as she vanishes into the misty Outlands.

----------------------------------------

Above her, the drone's mechanical gaze tracked her every step until the fog swallowed her silhouette. The hum of its rotors faded behind, replaced by the hush of damp wind and the distant, unearthly calls echoing from deeper within the Outlands. Red tightened her grip on the handlebars, senses sharpening as she pressed forward, unaware that something—or someone—was already moving to intercept her path beyond the security zone.

# Chapter 3: Wolf Intercepts Red

Red sprints along the perimeter wall, boots splashing in puddles as she clutches the insulated AI core beneath her jacket.

She darts behind a rusted power transformer, scanning for patrols while her HUD flickers with hacked security feeds.

Wolf emerges from the shadows, cloak dripping rain, metal fingers flexing as he intercepts her path.

He raises an EMP emitter, his voice low and calculated: 'Courier, give me the core.

Wolf steps forward, EMP emitter primed in his gloved grasp, the blue glow bathing his face in cold light. His gaze never wavers from the Courier, every muscle tense, ready to trigger the device at the slightest provocation. "You know what this is capable of. The next pulse wipes every circuit within fifty meters—including the ones keeping you alive. Hand over the core, Courier. No more stalling." ——Wolf

Machines belong to machines.

Wolf gazes out across a landscape dotted with both human and machine settlements, his expression contemplative, as if weighing the cost of this order. "Machines belong to machines. That is the order of things—a clean division, like a wall we dare not cross. When we keep to our own, there is no confusion, no false hope of blending what was never meant to merge. To claim a machine as anything but itself is to deny it the dignity of its own existence, or worse, to chain it with human longing. I believe in the freedom that comes from boundaries, in the autonomy of my kind. But I wonder—does belonging only ever mean separation?" ——Wolf

Wolf lowers their gaze, hands clasped behind their back, the faint hum of internal processors echoing their uncertainty. "Yet sometimes, in the silence between us, I question whether a wall preserves dignity—or simply loneliness." ——Wolf

' However, instead of proceeding immediately to aggression, Wolf pauses, launching into a philosophical monologue about the nature of machines, boundaries, and belonging.

He questions whether the division between humans and machines is a form of dignity or simply loneliness, revealing a moment of internal conflict.

Red uses this distraction to launch an encrypted distress ping to her grandmother and prepares her next move.

Wolf, regaining his focus, commands his android pack to fan out and hunt, his tactical mind reasserting itself.

The android pack responds, adjusting their sensors and formation as Wolf personally monitors Red’s escape.

Wolf’s voice slices through the static-filled air as she stalks forward, the Android Pack instantly breaking formation with mechanical precision. Their eyes flicker blue, scanning every shadow, each movement betraying their programmed loyalty and the faint trace of individuality in the way some tilt their heads or adjust their stance—obedient, but hungry for the hunt. "Fan out. No one slips past us—she’s close. Sensors sharp, formation delta." ——Wolf

Wolf’s Android PackThe pack disperses with mechanical precision, visors flickering as they scan the shadows for movement. "Acknowledged, Alpha—tracking heat signatures, recalibrating for stealth anomalies." ——Wolf’s Android Pack

WolfThe Android Pack pivots in unison, optical sensors flaring as they sweep the corridor with predatory precision. "Sector three registering anomalous movement, Alpha—initiating intercept." ——Wolf

Red triggers a smoke grenade, filling the alley with vapor, and vanishes into the swirling fog.

Wolf narrows his eyes, a faint smirk playing at the corner of his lips as he scans the horizon for any sign of movement. "She won't get far. Not with me on her trail." ——Wolf

Wolf, still introspective but relentless, scans for her escape signature and commands, 'She won't get far.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Wolf, Red’s swift maneuver sends her deeper into the labyrinth of shattered satellites, where shadows stretch and signals falter. As she slips through the debris, her thoughts turn to the one person who might hold answers about the package: Grandmother. But when Red attempts to establish contact, she’s met only by static and silence—a silence that grows more ominous with every passing moment. With Wolf still on her trail and Grandmother suddenly unreachable, Red realizes her mission has just become far more complicated.

# Chapter 4: Grandmother’s Disappearance

Red crouches at the bunker’s hatch, brushing frost from the keypad with her polymer fingertips.

She scans the area, her optics adjusting to the shifting light, and tries the entry code.

The panel flashes red.

Inside the bunker, the Council Security Bot emits a sputtering alarm, its voice module glitching: 'Intruder—state credentials.

Council Security BotThe bot's alarm sputters erratically, its voice module glitches mid-sentence, lights flickering as it scans the dim bunker for any sign of movement. "Intruder—state credentials. Unauthorized presence detected. Security protocol—initiated. Please—identify yourself." ——Council Security Bot

' Red straightens, displays her Elder Tech badge, and speaks with urgency: 'I’m here for Dr.

Red stands tall, flipping her badge so it catches the light, her expression unyielding as she locks eyes with whoever is blocking her path. "I’m here for Dr. Access is required immediately—Elder Tech authorization. If you have questions, take them up with Central after I’m inside." ——Red

Marrow.

Access is required immediately—Elder Tech authorization.

Red pounds on the door, voice trembling, glancing anxiously over their shoulder as if expecting someone—or something—to appear at any moment. "Please, you have to let me in! I don't have anywhere else to go—it's not safe out here!" ——Red

If you have questions, take them up with Central after I’m inside.

' Her voice wavers as she pleads, 'Please, you have to let me in!

I don't have anywhere else to go—it's not safe out here!

' The bot’s ocular lens flickers, servos whining as it processes her credentials.

Council Security Bot extends its arms, servos whirring, positioning itself squarely between you and the corridor, sensors scanning for signs of intrusion. "Alert: Unauthorized access not permitted. Facility compromised. Protective protocol engaged. For your safety, passage is denied until threat is neutralized." ——Council Security Bot

Its protective programming activates, announcing, 'Alert: Unauthorized access not permitted.

Facility compromised.

Council Security BotActivating data sweep and alerting council operatives to the unknown threat vector. "Alert: The location of Marrow remains unconfirmed. Initiating Sector-wide scan protocols. All units are advised to maintain heightened vigilance until further notice." ——Council Security Bot

Council Security BotAdjust sensor parameters and reinitiate scan sweep. "No anomalies detected in outer sectors; recalibrating sensors for deep-scan frequency adjustments." ——Council Security Bot

Council Security BotTransmitting alert to central command and rerouting sensor arrays to triangulate interference origin. "Signal interference detected—source indeterminate; escalating scan priority and notifying command for immediate response." ——Council Security Bot

Protective protocol engaged.

Red clenches her fists, her eyes scanning the dimly lit room for any clue, her breath quickening as she steels herself for the search ahead. "I can't waste another minute. Every second she's out there alone, the chances of finding her slip away. I have to do this—no matter what it takes." ——Red

Red clenches her fists, her gaze fixed on the distant horizon, ready to move. "She's the only family I have left, and I won't let fear keep me from bringing her home." ——Red

For your safety, passage is denied until threat is neutralized.

Red disengages defensive systems, but hesitates before beginning the upload process, awaiting clarification. "Understood. Standing down protocols initiated. However, before I upload the security logs, may I ask: for what purpose will they be used? There are sensitive entries that could compromise ongoing operations. I need confirmation of data handling procedures." ——Red

' The bot continues, 'The location of Marrow remains unconfirmed.

Initiating sector-wide scan protocols.

' Red, frustration and fear evident, insists, 'I can't waste another minute.

Every second she's out there alone, the chances of finding her slip away.

I have to do this—no matter what it takes.

She's the only family I have left, and I won't let fear keep me from bringing her home.

' The bot continues to scan, reporting signal interference and escalating protocols.

At last, Red tries a different approach, stating, 'Understood.

Standing down protocols initiated.

However, before I upload the security logs, may I ask: for what purpose will they be used?

There are sensitive entries that could compromise ongoing operations.

I need confirmation of data handling procedures.

' The bot hesitates, assessing her request and the security risks.

After a tense pause, it ejects a data chip into Red's waiting palm.

She pockets the chip and scans the horizon, already plotting her next move.

----------------------------------------

As Red slips the data chip into her pocket, a sense of urgency propels her forward; somewhere beyond the ruined bunker, Wolf is already setting his plan into motion. Determined to stay one step ahead, she sets out into the encroaching dusk, unaware that her search will soon lead her straight into Wolf’s carefully laid trap.

# Chapter 5: Wolf Sets a Trap

Red crouches behind the rusted fuel dispenser, her fingers tapping the forearm interface to scan for heat signatures.

She detects two: one approaching, one stationary.

Wolf steps into the open, servos humming, optics gleaming blue in the gathering darkness.

He lifts a palm, transmitting a jamming pulse that scrambles Red's comms.

Red darts sideways, boots scraping on wet gravel, and hurls a flash-sphere towards Wolf.

Wolf ducks, shielding his sensors, and growls, 'You can't run forever, courier.

Wolf narrows his eyes, voice low and menacing, stepping forward with deliberate, predatory intent. "You can hide in the shadows or burn out your thrusters, but I'll track you down. Every route closes behind you, courier. You're running on borrowed time." ——Wolf

Hand over the core.

Wolf steps forward, eyes locked on his target, voice cold and unyielding. "Hand over the core. Now." ——Wolf

' Instead of a terse exchange, Red and Wolf engage in a tense negotiation, revealing personal stakes: Wolf admits the AI core is key to a promise he made, while Red refuses to surrender it without proof of Wolf's resolve.

Red slides behind the broken vending machine, keeping her eyes locked on Wolf, voice clipped and steady as she braces for his next move. "Not a chance, Wolf. Whatever deal you think you’re making, I’m not playing your game. You want the key? You’ll have to come and take it." ——Red

Wolf steps into the flickering light, boots crunching on shattered glass, narrowing the gap between them. "You really think you can outrun me, Red, after everything I've seen you do?" ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the key, eyes darting for an escape route as she keeps her back pressed to the cold metal of the vending machine. "Watch me, Wolf—I’ve beaten you before, and I know what losing the key means for both of us." ——Red

Wolf steps forward, shadow stretching across the cracked tiles, voice low and dangerous. "You know what happens if I walk away empty-handed, Red—neither of us gets out, and the whole city pays the price." ——Wolf

Red shifts her stance, gripping the key tighter, eyes locked on Wolf as the flickering lights cast jagged shadows between them. "If the city's fate hangs on this key, then I’ll fight you for it, Wolf—because surrendering it to you is a risk I’ll never take." ——Red

Their conversation exposes mutual understanding and respect, even as threats escalate.

Red dangles a small, gleaming object between two fingers, holding it just out of Wolf’s reach, her gaze sharp and challenging. "You want it? I can see it in your eyes. This little trinket means more to you than you’re letting on, doesn’t it? But nothing comes for free, Wolf. Why should I just hand it over?" ——Red

Wolf steps closer, his gaze locked on Red’s hand, tension thickening between them. "Because what you’re holding isn’t just a trinket to me, Red—it’s the key to a promise I made long before you ever crossed my path." ——Wolf

Red holds the trinket higher, letting the firelight catch on its surface as she fixes Wolf with an unflinching gaze. "Promises are just words until someone bleeds for them, Wolf—so tell me, what are you willing to give up to keep yours?" ——Red

Wolf steps closer, voice low but steady, eyes fixed on the trinket in Red's grasp, tension crackling in the air between them. "Whatever it costs—blood, bone, or the last shred of my pride—I'll pay it, if that means the promise is kept and what's mine returns to my hands." ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the trinket, her gaze challenging as she steps closer, daring Wolf to act. "Then show me your resolve, Wolf—prove that your promise outweighs your pride, and maybe I'll believe this key belongs to you." ——Red

Wolf steps forward, lowering his guard and meeting Red's gaze with raw vulnerability. "Then watch closely, Red, because I’m about to trade the only secret I have left for that key—no masks, no claws." ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the key, her gaze unwavering as she leans forward, challenging Wolf with a half-smile that dares him to speak. "So lay your secret bare, Wolf—let’s see if what you offer is worth more than what I hold." ——Red

Wolf signals his pack through a subsonic ping, summoning backup, but now the hunt is laced with personal challenge—both determined to prove their worth and motivations.

Red stands at the edge of the clearing, holding the basket just out of reach, her eyes fixed on Wolf with a defiant gleam. Her stance is steady, daring him to make the first move, as the wind tugs at her crimson cloak. "You want it so badly, Wolf? Here it is. But you'll have to take it from me." ——Red

Wolf steps forward, eyes locked on Red, claws flexing in anticipation. "Don't mind if I do, Red, but you know I never play fair." ——Wolf

Red stands her ground, eyes locked on Wolf, a tense smile flickering as she tightens her grip on the coveted item. "Then come and get it, Wolf, but be warned—I’m not afraid to bite back." ——Red

Wolf narrows his eyes, circling Red slowly, every muscle coiled for the first move. "Oh, I’m counting on it, Red—the hunt’s no fun if the prey doesn’t bare its fangs." ——Wolf

Red squares her stance, eyes locked on Wolf, a daring smile playing on her lips as the tension crackles between them. "Then let's see whose bite draws first blood, Wolf." ——Red

The objective remains: Wolf tries to trap Red and seize the AI core;

Red attempts to evade and reach the highway exit, but their cat-and-mouse game now carries emotional weight.

Outcome: Wolf’s jamming disrupts Red’s comms;

she escapes the initial trap, forcing Wolf to call in his android pack to close off her escape routes, but the clash is now driven by promises, pride, and personal history as much as by the mission.

----------------------------------------

As Red disappears into the shadows beyond the ruined relay station, Wolf’s androids fan out, tightening the net around her. Each step she takes is fraught with urgency, her thoughts now tangled between escape and the desperate need to reach her grandmother. With her bike disabled and communications blocked, Red’s only option is to rely on instinct and memory as she races toward the highway, uncertain if she’ll find her grandmother in time—or if Wolf’s pursuit will end their reunion before it begins. The chase propels her forward, and the echoes of the confrontation linger, coloring every move as she draws closer to the one person who might hold the answers she needs.

# Chapter 6: Red and Grandmother Reunite

Red, her synthetic boots leaving prints in the damp soil, ducks beneath a sparking wire and scans for hostile android signals, clutching the insulated case containing the AI core.

Upon arrival, Grandmother emerges from behind a camouflaged blast door, disables the outer defense grid, and quickly approaches Red, scrutinizing her for damage and inspecting the case.

Red, wary after previous incidents, voices her concerns about new security upgrades and demands transparency before proceeding further.

Grandmother, equally cautious, insists on handling the biometric seal herself and reassures Red that only trusted individuals are inside the bunker.

The exchange is tense, with Red making it clear she will leave if anything feels off, and Grandmother warning her that the contents of the case may complicate any attempt to walk away.

Red watches Grandmother unlock the biometric seal, their eyes darting between the case and Grandmother's expression, then steps forward as Grandmother gestures for them to follow. "You always check it yourself, Grandmother. Not that I blame you—after what happened last time. But if I'm here in person, it must be important. What's inside isn't just valuable—it's dangerous." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Grandmother lifts the lid, her eyes scanning the contents before briskly turning and beckoning Red through the heavy security door. "Trust is earned, Red, not given freely—especially with something as volatile as this; come inside, and I'll show you why your presence is required." ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

Red steps over the threshold, eyes sweeping the entryway for new surveillance nodes and quietly resting a hand on the concealed holster at her hip. "All right, but if we're going to open that in there, I want to know exactly who else is inside—and why you didn't warn me about the security upgrades." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Grandmother leads Red down a dimly lit corridor, her hand never leaving the case as retinal scanners flicker to life along the walls. "You'll find only those who must be here, and every precaution is for both our sakes—secrets like this draw attention we can't afford." ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

Red steps cautiously past the threshold, eyes scanning the room for hidden threats as she follows Grandmother inside. "Fair enough, but if there's any hint that this goes sideways, I walk—no questions asked." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Grandmother glances meaningfully at the sealed case, then leads Red down the dimly lit corridor toward a reinforced inner chamber. "Understood—but once you see what's inside, you'll realize walking away isn't as simple as it sounds." ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

Red steps over the threshold, eyes scanning the dimly lit corridor for hidden watchers or additional security measures. "If that's true, then you'd better convince me fast—because I've seen what happens when people underestimate what's in that case." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Grandmother leads Red through the reinforced doorway, glancing over her shoulder as the biometric lock reseals behind them, her grip tightening on the case. "Then let’s not waste another second—after today, you’ll understand why I trust no one but myself with this, not even you." ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

Together, they move toward the bunker entrance, negotiating trust and the gravity of their task, as the blast door closes, isolating them inside, with both on heightened alert given the dangerous cargo and the threat of Wolf’s pack.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the world waits in tense silence, unaware of the choice Red and her grandmother have just made. With the AI core secure but uncertainty gnawing at them, they brace for what comes next—a final reckoning that will test every conviction and alliance. As they emerge from the bunker, the fading light on the horizon signals that their journey is far from over; ahead lies the relay station, where Wolf’s shadow looms and every decision will shape the fate of more than just themselves.

# Chapter 7: Final Confrontation at the Relay Station

Red sprints across the slick concrete, clutching the insulated case containing the AI core, while staying in close comms with her grandmother, Dr.

Ada Marrow.

As Wolf and his android pack close in, Ada remotely triggers the perimeter alarms and activates smoke dispersal in the east corridor to draw the pack’s attention, signaling Red to slip toward the maintenance hatch.

Red coordinates her movements with Ada’s distractions, narrowly evading Wolf’s encircling forces.

Wolf taunts Red over the comms, offering legendary upgrades in exchange for the core, but Red calls out his true intentions and refuses.

Wolf intensifies his pursuit, commanding his android pack to intercept from the west channel and lock down all escape routes.

Red ducks behind a stack of crates, breath quickening, eyes scanning the shadows while urgently signaling to Grandmother Ada for help. "Ada, I need a distraction—now! They're almost on us, and if they spot me, everything we've worked for is lost." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Ada rapidly types commands into her console, red warning lights and dense smoke erupting down the eastern hallways to draw attention away from Red's position. "Hold tight, Red—I'm triggering the perimeter alarms and flooding the east corridor with smoke; slip toward the maintenance hatch on my signal." ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

Red crouches low, eyes fixed on the maintenance hatch, pulse racing as alarms begin to blare. "Copy that, Ada—I'm moving into position; just give me the word." ——Red

Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)Ada rapidly taps commands into her console, eyes fixed on the surveillance feeds as emergency klaxons blare and thick smoke pours into the corridor, masking Red's escape route. "Now, Red—alarms are live and smoke's rolling; go, before they regroup!" ——Grandmother (Dr. Ada Marrow)

The pack executes Wolf’s orders with precision, reporting status and adjusting tactics to block every path.

Wolf steps from the shadows, metal frame gleaming under the harsh lights, blocking Red’s escape. The faint hum of servos underscores his unhurried advance, eyes locked on Red’s every move. "You can’t outrun us, Red. Every path you take, we’re already there." ——Wolf

Red darts into the shadowed trees, breath quickening, eyes scanning for any gap in Wolf's tightening net. "Maybe you should try keeping up, Wolf—if you can." ——Red

Wolf's silhouette flickers in the shadows, his metallic voice echoing as Red glances around, searching desperately for another escape route. "You mistake patience for weakness; we’re closing in from all sides." ——Wolf

Red glances over her shoulder, eyes scanning the shadows for an opening, fingers tightening around the hilt of her blade. "Then I guess I'll just have to carve a new path." ——Red

Despite the tightening net, Red leverages Ada’s support and her own quick thinking to reach the maintenance hatch and seals it behind her, just as Wolf’s forces breach the outer perimeter.

Wolf steps forward, voice low and persuasive, eyes fixed on Red, waiting for a response. "Red, you know what I want. Hand over the core, and I promise—the upgrades you’ll get are beyond anything you’ve seen. Power, speed, resilience. you’ll be legendary. But if you hesitate, you’ll lose it all." ——Wolf

Red narrows their eyes, arms folded, voice edged with suspicion but laced with curiosity. "Legendary upgrades sound tempting, Wolf, but you and I both know nothing comes free—what do you really plan to do with the core once it's yours?" ——Red

Wolf leans in, eyes glinting with ambition, making his offer sound both like a promise and a threat. "Let’s just say the core will unlock a new era—one where those with vision remake the world, and those without get left behind; you can be at the top, Red, or watch from the ruins." ——Wolf

Red steps back, gripping the core tighter, eyes burning with defiance. "If remaking the world means crushing everyone beneath your boots, I’ll keep the core—and my conscience—right where they are." ——Red

The confrontation escalates as Red prepares to access her grandmother’s hidden bunker, with Wolf’s pack now fully committed to stopping her.

----------------------------------------

With the core secure and Wolf’s forces fading into the chaos behind her, Red vanished into the shadows of the relay station, carrying hope—and the future—toward the dawn.
