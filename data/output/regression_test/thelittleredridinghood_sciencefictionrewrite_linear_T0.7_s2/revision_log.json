The updated plot now reflects the Council’s watchfulness and concern about Ada’s influence, as well as the potential for wider consequences, aligning with the provided dialogue while retaining Red’s immediate mission focus.",

These additions clarify Red’s resourcefulness and Ada’s hands-on support, and deepen the ideological conflict between Red and Wolf. Wolf’s pack also demonstrates more precise reporting and tactical adaptation. The updated plot incorporates these elements while maintaining the original narrative trajectory.",
