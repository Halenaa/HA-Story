Suddenly, Wolf-9's holographic avatar materializes, issuing a series of threats tempered with backhanded offers of leniency if Red backs down.

As their digital duel escalates, Red launches preemptive firewall reinforcements and actively locks down every access point, matching Wolf-9's threats with her own. Meanwhile, Grandmother emerges and gives verbal encouragement and technical assistance, her actions and words showing both determination and affection for Red, as she works to layer further protections on the system. The confrontation grows more complex, with all three exchanging not just code but personal philosophies on legacy, memory, and cunning. Red openly refuses to let either Wolf-9 or Grandmother claim the data core, positioning herself as a third force trying to outmaneuver both. Grandmother, recognizing the stakes, seeds the core with an ancestral cipher, making the data accessible only to kin. Wolf-9, relentless, adapts his attack with logic viruses while Red counters with deceptions and backdoors.
