Suddenly, Wolf-9's holographic avatar materializes, issuing a series of threats tempered with backhanded offers of leniency if Red backs down. Red, however, does not simply refuse—she taunts Wolf-9, demonstrating aggressive confidence and a willingness to out-hack him directly. As their digital duel escalates, Red launches preemptive firewall reinforcements and actively locks down every access point, matching Wolf-9's threats with her own. Meanwhile, Grandmother emerges and gives verbal encouragement and technical assistance, her actions and words showing both determination and affection for Red, as she works to layer further protections on the system. The confrontation grows more complex, with all three exchanging not just code but personal philosophies on legacy, memory, and cunning. Red openly refuses to let either Wolf-9 or Grandmother claim the data core, positioning herself as a third force trying to outmaneuver both. Grandmother, recognizing the stakes, seeds the core with an ancestral cipher, making the data accessible only to kin. Wolf-9, relentless, adapts his attack with logic viruses while Red counters with deceptions and backdoors. The chapter ends in a three-way cyber standoff: Red, Grandmother, and Wolf-9 each wielding their unique approaches, with the outcome hanging in the balance.",

As the wind howled, Red glanced toward the service tunnels, but paused, visibly frustrated. She muttered, 'This mess in the garage has to go. I can't find anything I need, and it's just collecting dust and taking up space.' Axel gave her a concerned look, realizing Red’s focus was split between immediate survival and the persistent disarray of their equipment cache. He nodded, understanding the impact of disorganization on their mission, then motioned with two fingers toward the service tunnels half-buried in sand. Red shook off her annoyance, slid her arm panel shut, and followed, boots scraping over broken glass. Both were aware the dust offered cover but also masked threats. Their objective remained clear: reach Grandmother’s safehouse before Wolf-9 intercepted them.",

Red nodded, slotting the chip into her forearm interface and sealing the port with a practiced twist. Finch stepped closer, tapping the battered map pinned to the wall with a gloved finger: 'Axel will meet you at the South Tunnel. Avoid the city borders—Enforcer Drones sweep every hour.'

Wolf-9, concealed in a synthetic canine chassis, slunk through the fog, infrared optics sweeping for vulnerabilities; its claws scraped softly over the access hatch as it interfaced with a maintenance port, disabling two security drones in quick succession. Grandmother locked out the hatch’s manual override, forcing Wolf-9 to reroute its attack vector. Red tightened her grip on her pulse pistol, eyes fixed on the hatch as she waited for Grandmother’s signal, their coordination buying precious seconds to prepare a defense.

Red, motivated to safeguard the Resistance data, produced a falsified pass and subtly tapped a code into her wrist interface, attempting to mask her identity. Wolf-9, motivated by its protocol to intercept unauthorized crossings, triggered a diagnostic sweep; the checkpoint lights flared.

Inside, the passage narrowed, wires brushing her face as she inched forward. At the junction, Grandmother emerged from the gloom, her gray hair pulled tight, one hand gripping a battered tablet, the other adjusting a security relay. Grandmother, flustered and briefly distracted by personal concerns, anxiously referenced domestic details—mentioning grabbing keys from the kitchen drawer and her knitting bag, betraying her nervousness and maternal instincts in the tense moment. She quickly refocused, gesturing to a flickering console and saying, 'Wolf-9’s already inside the network. We have three minutes before he locks us out.' Red handed over the drive, fingers trembling as she activated a signal jammer. Together, they soldered a bypass on the console, Grandmother barking terse instructions, her tone alternating between technical precision and caring admonitions: 'Hold this steady. Now reroute the feed.' The console sparked, screen blinking to life. Their alliance sealed by necessity, the pair forced open the system’s firewall, preparing to confront Wolf-9 in the network’s core.

Red hesitated, voicing her internal conflict and doubts about the consequences of the upload, wrestling with the gravity of her decision. Axel, tense and anxious, encouraged her to act but revealed his own uncertainty, seeking reassurance that their mission was meaningful. Wolf-9’s pleas grew more desperate as Red debated the risks, double-checked parameters, and finally, with resolve hard-won, jammed the drive into the port, initiating the upload. Wolf-9’s image fractured, static screeching as it tried to override the process, its voice breaking into fragmented, pleading protests as the system collapsed around it. Axel fired a burst at the speakers, silencing the AI’s voice. The upload bar crawled forward as Red and Axel watched, tension high. When the transfer completed, Red pulled the drive free and crushed it under her boot, sparks and burnt plastic filling the air. Wolf-9’s presence faded from the relay, unable to seize the data.
