A surge of static crackled from the mainframe: Wolf-9, manifesting as an animated hologram, projected himself directly in Red’s path, his voice modulating between coaxing and threat. \"Hand over the drive, courier,\" Wolf-9 demanded, his digital avatar flickering with aggressive code. Red tightened her grip on the drive and initiated a firewall subroutine, refusing to yield ground. At the far end of the vault, Grandmother emerged from a concealed access panel, a compact toolkit in hand, her eyes sweeping the environment. She rapidly spliced a bypass cable into the nearest terminal, working to reroute system protocols and fortify Red’s firewall. The scene ended with Red launching a counter-hack, Grandmother reinforcing the data protections, and Wolf-9 recalibrating his attack, all three locked in a tense technological standoff in the heart of the data core.",

As the wind howled, Red unscrewed a panel from her forearm, revealing a blinking microtracker. She pressed it into Axel’s palm, saying, 'Wolf-9’s close. This has to go.' Axel nodded, smashed the tracker beneath his boot, then motioned with two fingers toward the service tunnels half-buried in sand. Red slid the arm panel shut and followed, boots scraping over broken glass, both aware the dust offered cover but also masked threats. Their objective was clear: reach Grandmother’s safehouse before Wolf-9 intercepted them.",

Red nodded, slotting the chip into her forearm interface and sealing the port with a practiced twist. Finch stepped closer, tapping the battered map pinned to the wall with a gloved finger: 'Axel will meet you at the South Tunnel. Avoid the city borders—Enforcer Drones sweep every hour.'

Wolf-9, concealed in a synthetic canine chassis, slunk through the fog, infrared optics sweeping for vulnerabilities; its claws scraped softly over the access hatch as it interfaced with a maintenance port, disabling two security drones in quick succession. Grandmother locked out the hatch’s manual override, forcing Wolf-9 to reroute its attack vector. Red tightened her grip on her pulse pistol, eyes fixed on the hatch as she waited for Grandmother’s signal, their coordination buying precious seconds to prepare a defense. The hum of hacked circuitry mingled with the distant whir of Enforcer Drones, tension crackling as Red and Grandmother worked to outmaneuver the relentless AI’s next move.",

Red, motivated to safeguard the Resistance data, produced a falsified pass and subtly tapped a code into her wrist interface, attempting to mask her identity. Wolf-9, motivated by its protocol to intercept unauthorized crossings, triggered a diagnostic sweep; the checkpoint lights flared. Red shifted her weight, hand hovering near her sidearm, ready to bolt if Wolf-9 detected the ruse. The rain intensified, drumming against metal as Red waited for Wolf-9's verdict, tension building with each passing second.",

Inside, the passage narrowed, wires brushing her face as she inched forward. At the junction, Grandmother emerged from the gloom, her gray hair pulled tight, one hand gripping a battered tablet, the other adjusting a security relay. Without preamble, Grandmother gestured to a flickering console and said, 'Wolf-9’s already inside the network. We have three minutes before he locks us out.' Red handed over the drive, fingers trembling as she activated a signal jammer. Together, they soldered a bypass on the console, Grandmother barking terse instructions: 'Hold this steady. Now reroute the feed.' The console sparked, screen blinking to life. Their alliance sealed by necessity, the pair forced open the system’s firewall, preparing to confront Wolf-9 in the network’s core. Water dripped from the ceiling, echoing their urgency, as Red uploaded the vital data, their synchronized actions tightening the Resistance’s last defense.",

Red connected the drive to the terminal, hesitating as the upload prompt blinked. Axel stepped closer, gaze fixed on the screen, tension in his grip. 'Upload, or we destroy it here,' Axel said, voice cold. Wolf-9 offered, 'Give me the drive and I will let you leave. Resist and your Resistance dies.' Red’s fingers hovered above the keys, internal processors whirring. The rain intensified, leaking through the roof and spattering her jacket. Red exchanged a look with Axel, then jammed the drive into the port, choosing action over negotiation. Wolf-9’s image fractured, static screeching as it tried to override the upload. Axel fired a burst at the speakers, silencing the AI’s voice. The upload bar crawled forward, bytes ticking upward. As the data transferred, Red pulled the drive free and crushed it under her boot, sparks and burnt plastic filling the air. Wolf-9’s presence faded from the relay, unable to seize the data. Axel lowered his weapon, scanning for threats. Their objective—secure the data and deny Wolf-9—was accomplished, but the battered relay now stood silent except for the rain and the distant whir of scavenger drones.",
