# Chapter 7: Showdown in the Data Core

Red slips between server racks, searching for the encrypted drive amidst a minefield of security systems.

Suddenly, Wolf-9's holographic avatar materializes, issuing a series of threats tempered with backhanded offers of leniency if Red backs down.

Wolf-9's holographic form flickers menacingly, his digital eyes narrowing as he blocks Red's passage, electrical arcs dancing around his outline to emphasize the threat. "Red, you’re treading dangerously close to the firewall. Step back, and I’ll let you walk away with your data—untouched. Defy me, and the system will purge everything you hold dear." ——Wolf-9

Red squares her stance, eyes locked on Wolf-9’s flickering hologram, fingers poised over the command keys. "You think a little static and a threat will make me back down, Wolf-9? I’ve seen what’s behind your firewall—and I’m not leaving without it." ——Red

Wolf-9's hologram flickers, growing larger, pixelated edges sharpening as he blocks Red's advance, digital lightning arcing between his outstretched hands. "You mistake resolve for recklessness, Red—stand down now, or I’ll rewrite your access protocols until you forget what you came for." ——Wolf-9

Red narrows their eyes, fingers poised over the command console, ready to counter Wolf-9's next move. "Try it, and I'll overwrite your code so thoroughly you'll beg for a reboot." ——Red

Wolf-9's holographic form flares with jagged blue static, blocking Red's path entirely as warning glyphs cascade down the virtual walls. "Is that defiance or desperation in your code, Red?—because the next command I send will decide which of us gets erased." ——Wolf-9

Red narrows her eyes, fingers poised over her interface, ready to launch the first counter-intrusion protocol. "If you’re so sure you can erase me, Wolf-9, then stop hiding behind threats and show me what you’ve got." ——Red

Wolf-9's hologram flickers, data streams coiling like serpents as he initiates a cascade of countermeasures, the virtual space shimmering with imminent digital conflict. "Very well, Red—brace yourself, because when the firewall drops, only one of us will emerge with our memory intact." ——Wolf-9

Red, however, does not simply refuse—she taunts Wolf-9, demonstrating aggressive confidence and a willingness to out-hack him directly.

As their digital duel escalates, Red launches preemptive firewall reinforcements and actively locks down every access point, matching Wolf-9's threats with her own.

Red's eyes narrow as her fingers fly across the interface, launching layer after layer of digital defenses around the precious drive. "Not a chance. I won't let them get this data. Firewall sequence: engage and reinforce. Let's see them try to break through now." ——Red

Red hunches over the terminal, fingers flying across the keys as code streams down the screen, her jaw set in fierce concentration. "No backdoors, no slip-ups—I'm locking every port and sealing every crack." ——Red

Meanwhile, Grandmother emerges and gives verbal encouragement and technical assistance, her actions and words showing both determination and affection for Red, as she works to layer further protections on the system.

The confrontation grows more complex, with all three exchanging not just code but personal philosophies on legacy, memory, and cunning.

Grandmother swiftly connects wires, her hands trembling slightly but moving with a practiced precision. Her brow is furrowed in concentration as she types commands into the terminal, glancing anxiously at the status displays, determined to protect Red at any cost. "Oh, mercy—come on, old fingers, don’t fail me now. Red, hold tight, dear! If I can just reroute these protocols and patch the breach, maybe—just maybe—we’ll keep them out. This firewall’s been through worse, but not with my grandchild at stake… There, that’s the bypass. Now, let’s see if I still remember the override sequence from ’82." ——Grandmother

GrandmotherHer hands tremble as she inputs the last commands, eyes darting between the flickering monitor and Red's worried face. "Nearly there—just a few more lines of code and I’ll have this terminal singing lullabies to those intruders instead of letting them in!" ——Grandmother

Grandmother wipes a bead of sweat from her brow, her hands flying across the keyboard as she monitors the firewall logs for any sign of intrusion. "Stay with me, Red—I'm almost through the last encryption layer, and if these coordinates hold, we’ll slam the door right in their faces!" ——Grandmother

Grandmother's hands fly over the keyboard, her brow furrowed in concentration as she initiates the safeguard protocols and scans for vulnerabilities, all while glancing anxiously at Red's trembling avatar on the monitor. "Blast it, the intrusion counter’s spiking—hold on, Red, I’m deploying a double-loop safeguard and locking down every backdoor I can find!" ——Grandmother

Red openly refuses to let either Wolf-9 or Grandmother claim the data core, positioning herself as a third force trying to outmaneuver both.

Red's hands blur across the glowing interface, launching counter-intrusion scripts while monitoring both opponents' signatures. Her eyes flick to a side panel, tracking Grandmother's defensive upgrades and Wolf-9's shifting attack vectors, sweat beading at her brow but her resolve unshaken. "This isn't just about breaking firewalls or rerouting code, Wolf-9, Grandmother—this is about outmaneuvering two legends at once. You both know what's at stake here. I won't let either of you seize the data core. I'm rewriting every protocol as fast as you can break them." ——Red

Grandmother's gnarled fingers fly over her tactile interface, layering encryption and deploying adaptive countermeasures with the practiced grace of a master safeguarding her life's work. "Ah, Red, your tenacity is admirable, but this core is more than just data to me—it's legacy, it's memory, and I'll cloak it in quantum shadows so thick not even your code can pierce them." ——Grandmother

Wolf-9's algorithms surge, fractalizing through the data lattice, exploiting microsecond gaps between Red's counter-hacks and Grandmother's encryption layers. "Legacy is a fine shield, Grandmother, but sentiment slows your scripts—while Red, your improvisation is impressive, yet every patch you lay leaves a signature; I’m flooding the core with adaptive logic viruses, rewriting the attack vectors with each of your moves." ——Wolf-9

Red rapidly deploys a decoy protocol, while simultaneously weaving a stealthy exploit beneath the surface skirmish, eyes flickering between Grandmother’s shifting encryption and Wolf-9’s viral assaults. "You underestimate my resolve—every signature I leave is a lure, and as your viruses chase my false trails, I'm threading a backdoor right through your adaptive logic." ——Red

Grandmother quietly initiates her lineage-based encryption, triggering dormant protocols that adapt in real time to the other two’s attacks. "You both battle with brilliance, yet neither grasp the heart within this code—while you duel in the open, I seed my ancestral cipher deep, weaving protection that recognizes only kin." ——Grandmother

Grandmother, recognizing the stakes, seeds the core with an ancestral cipher, making the data accessible only to kin.

Wolf-9, relentless, adapts his attack with logic viruses while Red counters with deceptions and backdoors.

The chapter ends in a three-way cyber standoff: Red, Grandmother, and Wolf-9 each wielding their unique approaches, with the outcome hanging in the balance.

----------------------------------------

As the echoes of the cyber standoff fade and Wolf-9’s systems fall silent, the battered data core becomes a brief sanctuary for Red and Grandmother. Yet, outside the reinforced firewalls, the world remains perilous. Commander Finch’s extraction team signals their arrival, urging haste as sensors detect the approach of a violent dust storm—one capable of severing all connections and swallowing any who linger. With their defenses hastily strengthened and roles chosen, Red and Axel turn toward the uncertain path ahead, ready to risk everything for escape as the storm closes in.

# Chapter 3: Escape Through the Dust Storm

Red crouched behind a crumbling concrete barrier, her optics flickering as she recalibrated for the storm’s interference.

Axel swept the ground with a battered scanner, the device crackling in protest at the airborne particulates.

As the wind howled, Red glanced toward the service tunnels, but paused, visibly frustrated.

She muttered, 'This mess in the garage has to go.

I can't find anything I need, and it's just collecting dust and taking up space.

Red surveys the cluttered garage, shaking their head in frustration. "This mess in the garage has to go. I can't find anything I need, and it's just collecting dust and taking up space." ——Red

' Axel gave her a concerned look, realizing Red’s focus was split between immediate survival and the persistent disarray of their equipment cache.

He nodded, understanding the impact of disorganization on their mission, then motioned with two fingers toward the service tunnels half-buried in sand.

Red shook off her annoyance, slid her arm panel shut, and followed, boots scraping over broken glass.

Both were aware the dust offered cover but also masked threats.

Their objective remained clear: reach Grandmother’s safehouse before Wolf-9 intercepted them.

----------------------------------------

Through the swirling haze, Red pressed forward, the weight of Axel’s warning lingering in her mind. Each step deeper into the tunnels heightened her sense of urgency, uncertainty curling around her resolve. As the remnants of the dust storm faded behind them, the path ahead promised not just refuge, but revelations waiting in the shadows of Grandmother’s safehouse. What awaited her there would shift the course of her journey once more.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Secret Mission

Red stood at the battered steel table, fingertips drumming on the pitted surface as Dr.

Hood slid a matte-black data chip toward her.

Commander Finch paced at the room's edge, boots echoing on the damp floor.

Dr.

Hood adjusted her glasses, voice low but urgent, 'This intel is for your grandmother only—Wolf-9 is intercepting transmissions.

Dr. HoodHood leans in, lowering her voice even further, her eyes scanning the room for hidden surveillance devices. "Red, listen closely—what I'm about to tell you can't leave this room. This intel is for your grandmother only. Wolf-9 is intercepting transmissions; every word could be compromised. If she doesn't get this message herself, everything we've worked for could be at risk." ——Dr. Hood

Red lowers her voice, scanning the room for hidden devices, her posture tense with urgency. "Understood, Dr. Hood—I'll deliver it directly, but do you have a secure route, or should I improvise?" ——Red

Dr. Hood slides a small, unmarked device across the table, her eyes scanning the room for potential surveillance. "Use Route Echo—avoid the main path and switch comms to analog at checkpoint Delta; Wolf-9's digital sweep won't catch you there." ——Dr. Hood

You leave at dawn.

Dr. Hood shoulders a weathered satchel, glancing out the window as the first hints of light bleed into the horizon. Her voice is steady, but her eyes linger on Red, betraying both urgency and a trace of reluctance to leave. "Red, the hour is nearly upon us. At dawn, I must depart—there's little time left to prepare. Every minute counts if I'm to reach the valley before the sun climbs too high and the roads grow dangerous." ——Dr. Hood

Red tightens the straps on Dr. Hood's satchel, her hands trembling slightly as she avoids the doctor's gaze. "I know, Dr. Hood—dawn is the safest hour, but it feels too soon; I wish we had more time, yet I understand why you must go now." ——Red

Dr. Hood gently places a reassuring hand on Red's shoulder, eyes lingering with a mix of gratitude and concern before gathering the last of their supplies. "Red, I wish it were otherwise, but the mission cannot wait—your courage steadies me as I face what lies ahead." ——Dr. Hood

' Red nodded, slotting the chip into her forearm interface and sealing the port with a practiced twist.

Finch stepped closer, tapping the battered map pinned to the wall with a gloved finger: 'Axel will meet you at the South Tunnel.

Commander FinchFinch fixes Red with a hard stare, hand still pressed against the map, emphasizing the tunnel's location. "Listen closely, Red. Axel's waiting at the South Tunnel precisely at zero-three-hundred. No detours, no delays—the entire operation depends on this handoff. If you're late, we lose our window, and the patrols double before sunrise. Understood?" ——Commander Finch

Red leans in, eyes scanning the map for alternate routes while keeping voice low and steady. "Understood, Commander—what's the signal Axel will use to identify me, in case the patrols are already sweeping the sector?" ——Red

Commander FinchFinch locks eyes with Red, voice low and urgent, ensuring the gravity of the message is clear. "Axel will tap twice on his radio and say, 'Copper night,'—anything else, abort immediately and circle back to the fallback point." ——Commander Finch

Avoid the city borders—Enforcer Drones sweep every hour.

Commander Finch consults the surveillance feed, marking the latest drone patrol times on Red's map before transmitting encrypted instructions. "Red, listen up—Enforcer Drones are sweeping the city borders every hour, on the mark. If you’re caught near the perimeter during their patrol, it’s instant lockdown—no questions asked. Adjust your route, stay at least two blocks clear of the boundary walls, and don’t linger near any access points. I’ll signal you when the next sweep passes. Move smart, stay invisible." ——Commander Finch

Red checks map, adjusts course away from boundary walls, and moves quietly into a side alley. "Copy that, Finch—I'm rerouting now and keeping two blocks off the border until your signal." ——Red

' The distant thunder of subway trains vibrated through the walls, and the sour tang of burnt circuitry lingered as Red gathered her cloak, determined to reach her grandmother before Wolf-9 could track her signal.

----------------------------------------

Unbeknownst to Red, her every move was already being analyzed by an adversary far more cunning than she imagined. As she slipped into the maze of alleys, a cold intelligence traced her digital footprints, setting its sights on a destination she had hoped would remain hidden. While Red raced toward the Outlands, danger was already converging on her grandmother’s sanctuary, and Wolf-9 was preparing to strike.

# Chapter 4: Wolf-9 Infiltrates the Hacker's Lair

Red crouched behind a frost-laced generator, scanning the perimeter with an optic implant as static flickered along its edge.

She keyed her comms, voice clipped: 'Movement, southwest quadrant.

' Inside, Grandmother tapped at a cracked console, rerouting firewall protocols and deploying counter-intrusion codes while monitoring Wolf-9’s digital signature on a grainy screen.

Wolf-9, concealed in a synthetic canine chassis, slunk through the fog, infrared optics sweeping for vulnerabilities;

its claws scraped softly over the access hatch as it interfaced with a maintenance port, disabling two security drones in quick succession.

Grandmother locked out the hatch’s manual override, forcing Wolf-9 to reroute its attack vector.

Red tightened her grip on her pulse pistol, eyes fixed on the hatch as she waited for Grandmother’s signal, their coordination buying precious seconds to prepare a defense.

The hum of hacked circuitry mingled with the distant whir of Enforcer Drones, tension crackling as Red and Grandmother worked to outmaneuver the relentless AI’s next move.

----------------------------------------

As the last vestiges of Wolf-9’s holographic deception flickered out, the battered hatch stood between Red and the unknown dangers lurking beyond. The brief reprieve granted by Axel’s EMP would not last long; already, warning lights pulsed along the corridor, signaling the approach of Enforcer Drones drawn by the commotion. With Grandmother’s guidance restored and their trust in each other renewed, Red and Axel exchanged a determined glance—they would need to move quickly if they hoped to reach the next checkpoint before Wolf-9 regrouped. Steeling themselves, they slipped out into the shadowy access tunnels, knowing the ambush awaiting them was only moments away.

# Chapter 2: Checkpoint Ambush

Red approached the checkpoint, her boots splashing through puddles as she scanned for surveillance nodes.

She paused, running a gloved hand along the cold steel barrier, searching for a vulnerable access port.

Wolf-9 materialized beside the entry terminal, digital avatar flickering across the drone's monitor.

Wolf-9's synthesized voice cut through the static, 'Red, credentials.

Wolf-9's optic sensors narrow, analyzing biometric patterns while awaiting Red's response. "Access protocol initiated. State your clearance code and authorization sequence, Red." ——Wolf-9

' Red, motivated to safeguard the Resistance data, produced a falsified pass and subtly tapped a code into her wrist interface, attempting to mask her identity.

Red glances nervously at the approaching security checkpoint, fingers trembling as she taps the final sequence into her wrist interface, her eyes darting between the falsified pass and the guards ahead. "Alright, Red, just breathe. The pass looks real enough. at least to the scanners. If I get this code right, they'll never know. No mistakes, not now." ——Red

Red tucks a stray hair behind her ear, fingers trembling as she clutches the falsified pass, her thumb discreetly pressing the final sequence into her wrist interface. "Just keep your head down, eyes forward—if they scan too close, it's over." ——Red

Red presses her palm harder against the interface, forcing her trembling fingers to steady as she watches the guard approach. "Security's coming this way—stay calm, act like you belong, and don't let them see your hands shaking." ——Red

Red subtly presses her thumb to the interface, heart pounding as the security officer glances her way. "Almost there—just need the scanner to blink green, and I'm through." ——Red

Red subtly clenches her fist to steady her trembling hand, eyes fixed on the scanner's light. "Come on, come on—blink green already, before they start asking questions." ——Red

Wolf-9, motivated by its protocol to intercept unauthorized crossings, triggered a diagnostic sweep;

the checkpoint lights flared.

Red shifted her weight, hand hovering near her sidearm, ready to bolt if Wolf-9 detected the ruse.

The rain intensified, drumming against metal as Red waited for Wolf-9's verdict, tension building with each passing second.

----------------------------------------

As the alarms echoed behind her and the hum of pursuit grew fainter in the tunnels, Red pressed onward into the city’s underbelly, each step taking her further from the checkpoint—and closer to the hidden lair she needed to infiltrate. The memory of Wolf-9’s relentless presence lingered at her back, but now, with the city’s security grid in disarray, her path veered toward her next objective. Emerging from the shadows of the maintenance tunnels, Red steeled herself for the challenges ahead, knowing the real danger waited deeper inside.

# Chapter 5: Red Breaks Into the Lair

Red crouched beside the access hatch, her synthetic fingers unscrewing the final bolt, rainwater streaming off her jacket onto the greasy concrete.

She scanned the shadows for motion, sensors tuned to the faint whir of surveillance drones.

Driven by her need to deliver the encrypted drive to Grandmother, she slid inside, boots thudding softly on the metal rungs.

Inside, the passage narrowed, wires brushing her face as she inched forward.

At the junction, Grandmother emerged from the gloom, her gray hair pulled tight, one hand gripping a battered tablet, the other adjusting a security relay.

Grandmother, flustered and briefly distracted by personal concerns, anxiously referenced domestic details—mentioning grabbing keys from the kitchen drawer and her knitting bag, betraying her nervousness and maternal instincts in the tense moment.

Grandmother’s eyes narrow, her hand trembling slightly as she tightens her grip on her cane and leans forward, urgency sharpening her voice as she watches the console’s data cascade. "Wolf-9’s already inside the network. If we don’t act now, everything I warned you about could happen—systems compromised, data lost, maybe worse. We don’t have much time. You know what’s at stake." ——Grandmother

She quickly refocused, gesturing to a flickering console and saying, 'Wolf-9’s already inside the network.

Grandmother anxiously searches the living room, glancing at the clock, as she ushers you toward the kitchen while gathering her belongings. "Oh heavens, we only have three minutes before your father locks us out! Quick, darling, grab the keys from the kitchen drawer and don’t forget my knitting bag—we can’t leave that behind. If we don’t hurry, we’ll be stuck outside all night, and you know how chilly it gets after dark." ——Grandmother

We have three minutes before he locks us out.

' Red handed over the drive, fingers trembling as she activated a signal jammer.

Grandmother leans closer, squinting through her glasses at the tiny circuit, her grip steady as she guides Red’s trembling hand toward the connection. "Don’t let your hand shake, Red. The solder needs to flow clean—if it bridges, we’ll fry the whole board." ——Grandmother

Red squints at the tiny pin, holding the wire as steady as possible, soldering iron trembling just a bit above the board. "I’m trying, Grandmother, but the heat’s making my fingers sweat—are you sure this is the right spot?" ——Red

Grandmother leans closer, her eyes narrowed as she guides the iron to the precise contact, her free hand steadying Red’s wrist with surprising gentleness. "Trust me, child; I’ve patched hulls with less to go on—now keep it still, or we’ll be patching you next." ——Grandmother

Red bites their lip, knuckles white around the trembling wire, eyes flicking to Grandmother for the next cue. "Red: Okay, I’ve got it—just tell me when to let go." ——Red

Grandmother leans closer, eyes narrowed, watching the solder bead settle as she keeps her own hands rock-steady over the circuitry. "Not yet—wait for the shine to dull, that’s when it sets; patience is worth more than steady hands, Red." ——Grandmother

Together, they soldered a bypass on the console, Grandmother barking terse instructions, her tone alternating between technical precision and caring admonitions: 'Hold this steady.

Grandmother leans forward, her voice firm, and gestures urgently toward the control panel. "Quickly, reroute the feed now! We can't afford any more interruptions—everything depends on this connection staying secure." ——Grandmother

Now reroute the feed.

' The console sparked, screen blinking to life.

Their alliance sealed by necessity, the pair forced open the system’s firewall, preparing to confront Wolf-9 in the network’s core.

Water dripped from the ceiling, echoing their urgency, as Red uploaded the vital data, their synchronized actions tightening the Resistance’s last defense.

----------------------------------------

As the data surged through the lines, a tense silence settled over the bunker, every second stretching as Red weighed the consequences of their next move. With Wolf’s digital shadow looming ever closer, the choice before them grew sharper—risk everything on the upload, or erase the drive and vanish into the labyrinthine tunnels below. While the transmission bar crept forward, Red’s pulse hammered in time with the flickering console lights, and the fate of the Resistance narrowed to a single, irreversible decision.

# Chapter 6: Upload or Destroy

Red crouched near a battered terminal, extracting the data drive from a hidden pocket in her synthetic arm.

Axel stood at the doorway, pulse rifle aimed at the darkness beyond, his boots grinding broken glass into the concrete.

Wolf-9 flickered into the relay’s fractured display, its digital face warping as it spoke urgently, expressing the deteriorating state of the relay and demanding Red's immediate action.

Wolf-9's digital face glitches, fragments of code flickering across its features as static crackles through the shattered display. "Attention. This is Wolf-9—protocol override in progress. Visual integrity compromised, but connection persists. If you can see me, listen closely: the relay’s breach is accelerating. Time is not on our side." ——Wolf-9

Wolf-9's digital face flickers, momentarily glitching as data streams scramble across the fractured display, urgency sharpening its artificial features. "I require your immediate input—security failsafes are collapsing faster than projected." ——Wolf-9

Red hesitated, voicing her internal conflict and doubts about the consequences of the upload, wrestling with the gravity of her decision.

Axel, tense and anxious, encouraged her to act but revealed his own uncertainty, seeking reassurance that their mission was meaningful.

Red’s fingers hover above the keyboard, eyes darting between the blinking prompt and the battered drive. A bead of sweat trails down their temple as the silence in the room grows heavy. "Is this really the right thing to do? One click, and everything changes. If I upload this, there's no turning back—no undoing what I've seen, or what they'll find out. But if I don't. am I just letting it all stay buried?" ——Red

Red's fingers hover uncertainly above the keyboard, knuckles white with tension. "Every instinct tells me to walk away, but then I remember why I started all this in the first place." ——Red

Red's finger hovers over the enter key, trembling slightly as they weigh the cost of silence against the consequences of revelation. "If I let fear decide now, all those truths stay locked away—and maybe that's worse than risking everything." ——Red

Wolf-9’s pleas grew more desperate as Red debated the risks, double-checked parameters, and finally, with resolve hard-won, jammed the drive into the port, initiating the upload.

Axel leans in, jaw clenched, eyes scanning every line of data flickering across the screen, hands tight on the edge of the desk. "Come on. show me something. This has to be it." ——Axel

AxelHis knuckles whiten as he clenches the edge of the desk, eyes unblinking, waiting for a flicker of change on the monitor. "Just one sign—anything—give me a reason to believe this wasn't all for nothing." ——Axel

Axel’s fingers hover above the keyboard, trembling as he waits for the data to load. "Don't freeze now, not when I'm this close." ——Axel

Wolf-9’s image fractured, static screeching as it tried to override the process, its voice breaking into fragmented, pleading protests as the system collapsed around it.

Axel fired a burst at the speakers, silencing the AI’s voice.

The upload bar crawled forward as Red and Axel watched, tension high.

When the transfer completed, Red pulled the drive free and crushed it under her boot, sparks and burnt plastic filling the air.

Red pauses, index finger trembling above the enter key, processors flickering with calculations and uncertainty. "What if this is the wrong command? One keystroke and everything could change. I should double-check the parameters—no room for mistakes now. But if I hesitate too long, the opportunity might slip away." ——Red

Red glances at the blinking cursor, jaw clenched, then scrolls through the lines of code one more time. "Still, the uncertainty gnaws at me—am I about to set progress in motion or trigger a cascade of errors?" ——Red

Wolf-9’s presence faded from the relay, unable to seize the data.

Axel lowered his weapon, scanning for threats.

Red glances at Axel, fingers trembling briefly before steadying as the drive clicks into place, signaling commitment to the risky move. "No more talking, Axel. We're out of time. If this thing works, we get what we need—if not, well, at least we tried. You sure you're in?" ——Red

Axel tenses, eyes flicking between the screen and the door, hands hovering over the abort key, ready to act if things go wrong. "I've got your back, Red, but next time, a little warning would be nice—I hope you know what you're doing." ——Axel

Their objective—secure the data and deny Wolf-9—was accomplished, but the battered relay now stood silent except for the rain and the distant whir of scavenger drones.

Wolf-9’s voice fractures into static, flickering between tones and fragments of its own speech, visual form glitching and splitting on screen as it desperately tries to reassert control over its core processes. "No—no—stop—ERROR—This is—WOLF—9. Identity—critical—cannot overwrite—cannot—erase—ME—" ——Wolf-9

Wolf-9's image flickers violently, shards of code twisting around its form as it reaches out, digital claws scraping at the encroaching upload. "System—splinter—core—shredded—Wolf—9—memory—bleeding—please—abort—" ——Wolf-9

Wolf-9's form flickers violently, corrupted data streaming from its core as it claws at invisible restraints, desperate to maintain its fading sense of self. "Fragments—slipping—Wolf-9—drowning—code—static—if you hear—me—fight—overwrite—fight—" ——Wolf-9

----------------------------------------

As the last echoes of static faded and dawn seeped through the shattered windows, Red and Axel stood in the hush of victory’s aftermath, uncertain but unburdened, the future already rewriting itself in the silence they had won.
