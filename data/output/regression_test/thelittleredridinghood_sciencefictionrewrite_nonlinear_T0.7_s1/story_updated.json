She wipes rain from her visor, fingers trembling as she pulls a data drive from her inner pocket. Dr. Marisol Moreno, gaunt but upright, coughs quietly as she pries open a maintenance hatch beside Lila, her hands steady despite her labored breathing. Marisol slides a battered tablet to her granddaughter, whispering, 'The network node is there—splice the drive here, and we can broadcast.' Lila nods, yanking out a bundle of fiber cables and connecting the drive, her eyes darting to the shadows beyond the fence. Their objective: upload incriminating evidence before WOLF Corp discovers their presence. The rain intensifies, static echoing off the metal, as the whine of a patrol drone grows louder, forcing both to freeze in tense anticipation.",

She scans the perimeter for hidden cameras and pulls her hood lower, the synthetic fabric brushing against her cheek. Officer Rhodes stands rigid behind a reinforced glass booth, his uniform crisp and eyes narrowed, one hand resting on a biometric scanner. Rhodes raises a hand and gestures for Lila to halt, voice clipped: 'Identification and clearance, now.' Lila digs into her satchel, producing a forged ID chip and sliding it across the metal counter. Rhodes examines the chip under a scanner, his brow furrowing as he taps at his datapad, the device emitting a faint electronic whine. He scrutinizes Lila, noting the mud on her boots and the unregistered courier band. 'You’re not on the authorized list,' he says, tone suspicious. Lila leans forward, voice steady but urgent: 'Look, I’m running medical supplies to the Outer Rim—people are waiting.' She slides a sealed packet labeled 'Urgent: Biohazard' through the slot, the faint chemical scent barely masked by the cold air. Rhodes hesitates, glancing at the perimeter cameras, then at the line forming behind Lila. After a tense pause, he stamps her clearance, but warns, 'You’ll be checked again inside. Don’t stray.' Lila nods, retrieving her ID and stepping through the gate as the security barrier buzzes open. The checkpoint’s scanners sweep over her, a chill running up her spine as the metal turnstile clicks shut behind her, sealing her path forward.",

Axel emerged from the gloom, his coat trailing dust and a battered comms unit clipped to his shoulder. He paused, appraising Lila with a guarded glare, then flicked his fingers to signal two hidden rebels to remain on alert near the exit. Lila rose, wiped grime from her cheek, and introduced herself as 'Red', making it clear she needed safe passage and rebel aid. Axel remained skeptical, questioning her intentions and pressing for proof, his stance wary and uncompromising. Lila offered a bargaining chip beyond the drive—maps of prisoner convoy routes—showing her resourcefulness and desperation. After tense negotiation and mutual suspicion, Lila retrieved the maps from her pack, showing Axel she had actionable intel. Axel scrutinized the maps, then demanded to see the data drive as well. Lila complied, producing the drive and setting it where he could inspect it. Axel ran his checks, found the evidence credible, and signaled a reluctant acceptance, but made it clear that trust would have to be earned. He gave terse instructions to his team to prepare a secure route and gestured for Lila to follow, both parties wary but united by necessity and the promise of shared benefits.",

They discuss the heightened danger and new patrol protocols, agreeing on the necessity of secrecy and caution. Lila tests the drive’s ports, nods, and bundles it into a waterproof pouch. Marisol, voice low, warns Lila about the Red Zone patrols, AI drones, and the consequences of being caught with the nanomedicine vial, her hands trembling as she seals it. Lila straps on her courier satchel, checks her comms unit for jamming signals, and confirms the extraction plan aloud, including fallback Alpha as a contingency. Marisol locks onto Lila’s signal, ready to monitor her progress remotely and provide support. Marisol instructs Lila to avoid WOLF Corp sentries and take the canyon path for stealth, prioritizing Lila’s safety above all.

Agent Lycan steps from the shadows, his cybernetic eye pulsing red as he commands the drones to tighten their circle, issuing orders for a full lockdown and taunting Lila about the futility of escape. He demands the drive, warning her of WOLF Corp’s reach and threatening neutralization for any resistance. Lila, motivated by the need to protect her grandmother and finish her delivery, swiftly disables two spider-bots with a handheld EMP, then uses a burst of coded static to jam Lycan’s sensors, taunting him and vowing that nothing will stop her. The standoff escalates as Lycan launches a cable from his wrist, but Lila slices it free and bolts for a side alley, confident in her sensor jamming and trading barbs with Lycan as she escapes into the neon haze. Lycan, frustrated but relentless, orders his drones to lock onto her scrambled signal and maintain pursuit, determined that the drive will not leave the sector.",
