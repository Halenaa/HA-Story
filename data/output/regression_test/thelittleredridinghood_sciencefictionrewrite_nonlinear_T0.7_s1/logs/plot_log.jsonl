Rhodes examines the chip under a scanner, his brow furrowing as he taps at his datapad, the device emitting a faint electronic whine. He scrutinizes Lila, noting the mud on her boots and the unregistered courier band. 'You’re not on the authorized list,' he says, tone suspicious. Lila leans forward, voice steady but urgent: 'Look, I’m running medical supplies to the Outer Rim—people are waiting.' She slides a sealed packet labeled 'Urgent: Biohazard' through the slot, the faint chemical scent barely masked by the cold air.
