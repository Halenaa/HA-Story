Rhodes raises a hand and gestures for Lila to halt, voice clipped: 'Identification and clearance, now.' Lila digs into her satchel, producing a forged ID chip and sliding it across the metal counter. Rhodes examines the chip under a scanner, his brow furrowing as he taps at his datapad, the device emitting a faint electronic whine. He scrutinizes Lila, noting the mud on her boots and the unregistered courier band. 'You’re not on the authorized list,' he says, tone suspicious. Lila leans forward, voice steady but urgent: 'Look, I’m running medical supplies to the Outer Rim—people are waiting.' She slides a sealed packet labeled 'Urgent: Biohazard' through the slot, the faint chemical scent barely masked by the cold air. Rhodes hesitates, glancing at the perimeter cameras, then at the line forming behind Lila. After a tense pause, he stamps her clearance, but warns, 'You’ll be checked again inside. Don’t stray.' Lila nods, retrieving her ID and stepping through the gate as the security barrier buzzes open. The checkpoint’s scanners sweep over her, a chill running up her spine as the metal turnstile clicks shut behind her, sealing her path forward."}, "output": {"dialogue": []}}

Agent Lycan steps from the shadows, his cybernetic eye pulsing red as he commands the drones to tighten their circle, issuing orders for a full lockdown and taunting Lila about the futility of escape. He demands the drive, warning her of WOLF Corp’s reach and threatening neutralization for any resistance.
