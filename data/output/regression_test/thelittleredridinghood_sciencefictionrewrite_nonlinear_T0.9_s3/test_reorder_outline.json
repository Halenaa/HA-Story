        "summary": "Red enters the dome, confronting the Wolf Unit in a tense standoff. She distracts the Wolf with false data uploads while using her backup drone to free her grandmother.

        "narrative_role": "Inciting action opener",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open the novel in third person limited perspective, past tense, tightly focused on Red’s experience as she breaks into the dome for the showdown. Establish Red as unfamiliar to the reader and avoid references to prior events. Show her perception of the Wolf Unit and her grandmother as if for the first time. Drip in only essential context for clarity, withholding backstory for later chapters.",
        "transition_hint": "After the climax of the dome escape and rescue, transition to a reflective, destabilized moment for Red (e.g., catching her breath, looking at the quantum drive), which can naturally prompt a flashback to how she got here."
