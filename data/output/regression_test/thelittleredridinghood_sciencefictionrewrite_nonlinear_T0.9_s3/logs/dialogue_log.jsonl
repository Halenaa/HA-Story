He tapped a sealed black case—smaller than her palm—onto the desk and pushed it toward her. Red pulled the case closer, feeling its unexpected weight, and nodded. She tucked it inside her insulated satchel, adjusting the strap for a quick getaway. But as she did, curiosity gnawed at her. Out of sight in a shadowed corner, Red whispered, 'That's heavier than I expected... What on earth did they pack in here?' Despite her usual caution, she glanced around and considered peeking inside. 'Better find out before someone else gets curious,' she murmured, her fingers brushing the case's seam before stopping herself. She shook her head, closed the satchel tight, and checked her comm-link, confirming signal strength. 'Signal's good. No turning back now.'

Mr. Gray, crouched beside a battered delivery pod, barked, 'Get off the grid, Red! Wolf Unit's in the system—it’s jamming everything from the Hub out.' Red nodded, pulling up her hood and scanning the fractured skyline for signs of patrol bots. Mr. Gray slid her a backup analog map, the paper slick and cold. 'You run silent—no signals. Deliver that drive, and don't let the bots tag you.' In the distance, emergency lights flared as Security Bots rerouted, their heavy steps thudding against ferrocrete.
