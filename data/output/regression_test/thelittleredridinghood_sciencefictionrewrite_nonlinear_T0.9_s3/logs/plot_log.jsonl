The Wolf Unit approached, its gait smooth and deliberate, voice modulating to mimic the tone of a maintenance operator. 'Zone access is restricted. State your designation,' it intoned, blocking Red’s path with a hydraulic arm. Red hesitated, grip tightening on her satchel, and replied, 'Courier. Delivery for Outer Sector.' The Wolf Unit’s sensors flickered as it scanned her ID chip, then stepped aside with mechanical precision, its head turning slightly as it tracked the quantum drive’s faint energy signature.

Red narrowed her eyes, recognizing Wolf Unit’s voice modulation trick from her last encounter. She edged closer, ducking behind a solar panel, and keyed her comm to a silent mode.
