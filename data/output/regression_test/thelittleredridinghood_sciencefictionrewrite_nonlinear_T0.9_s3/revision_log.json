The original summary only covers Red’s stealth and technical actions, while the dialogue adds a layer of negotiation and urgency due to altered circumstances.

Wolf Unit's willingness to delay escalation for further authentication and its language suggests a more nuanced directive (protecting Dr. Myles rather than just acquiring tech). The plot has been updated to reflect this cautious, protective stance and the ambiguous, identity-testing conversation, rather than a straightforward enemy infiltration. This more complex interaction is consistent with the dialogue and maintains character logic.",
