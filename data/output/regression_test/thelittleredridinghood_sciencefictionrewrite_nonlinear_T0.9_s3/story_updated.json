Wolf Unit reveals its parameters changed due to Red’s signal deviation, prompting a tense exchange. Red explains she had to reroute to avoid hostiles at the extraction point, prioritizing mission integrity over strict protocol. Wolf Unit demands immediate relay of coordinates and package status, threatening to initiate contingency protocols if Red does not comply. Red, understanding the stakes, uploads the new coordinates and confirms the package is intact, warning that activating contingency protocols could jeopardize both their objectives. The interaction is tense but professional, with both parties negotiating to secure the quantum drive under heightened threat.",

Mr. Gray, leaning against a crate stamped with hazard warnings, checked the manifest and grunted, 'Danger run to the Outer Sectors, Red. Heavy pay, but you know the risks.' He tapped a sealed black case—smaller than her palm—onto the desk and pushed it toward her. Red pulled the case closer, feeling its unexpected weight, and nodded. She tucked it inside her insulated satchel, adjusting the strap for a quick getaway. But as she did, curiosity gnawed at her. Out of sight in a shadowed corner, Red whispered, 'That's heavier than I expected... What on earth did they pack in here?' Despite her usual caution, she glanced around and considered peeking inside. 'Better find out before someone else gets curious,' she murmured, her fingers brushing the case's seam before stopping herself. She shook her head, closed the satchel tight, and checked her comm-link, confirming signal strength. 'Signal's good. No turning back now.' With one last look at Mr. Gray, she slipped out the side door, boots crunching on frost-slicked ferrocrete as the morning wind rattled loose metal panels overhead.",

Determined to warn her grandmother, she tapped furiously at her wrist console, but the network refused her access, error codes scrolling in red. Mr. Gray, crouched beside a battered delivery pod, barked, 'Get off the grid, Red! Wolf Unit's in the system—it’s jamming everything from the Hub out.' Red nodded, pulling up her hood and scanning the fractured skyline for signs of patrol bots. Mr. Gray slid her a backup analog map, the paper slick and cold. 'You run silent—no signals. Deliver that drive, and don't let the bots tag you.' In the distance, emergency lights flared as Security Bots rerouted, their heavy steps thudding against ferrocrete. Red stuffed the map inside her jacket, grit crunching beneath her boots as she slipped into the shadow of a ventilation shaft, determined to reach her grandmother before Wolf Unit could lock down the sector.",

As she scanned the fence line, her breath frosting in the chill, she timed her movement between the rotating beams of the Security Bots’ scanners. As she darted across the open gravel, a figure emerged from the mist—an imposing patrol bot with a sleek, matte shell and glowing blue optics. The Wolf Unit approached, its gait smooth and deliberate, but instead of its usual emotionless protocol, it analyzed the situation aloud, noting the unexpected lockdown and suggesting reassessment and intel gathering. The Wolf Unit scanned for surveillance activity, tapped into local network nodes, and detected recent movement beyond the perimeter. When Red was confronted, she responded defiantly, refusing to comply with protocol and challenging the bot's authority. The Wolf Unit escalated its response, initiating lockdown sequence. Red, realizing the gravity of the situation and the importance of her mission, admitted she was a courier with a critical delivery for the Outer Sector, emphasizing the necessity of her task for the colony's survival. The interaction grew tense, with Red asserting her determination to complete the delivery despite obstacles, while the Wolf Unit calculated its next move, now more alert to the mission's stakes and Red's resolve.",

While Red remains outside, inside the dome, Wolf Unit confronts someone it believes may be Dr. Lira Myles, but their communications are distorted and ambiguous. A tense, cryptic exchange unfolds: Grandmother (or someone posing as her) uses personal memories and coded references to test Wolf Unit’s loyalty and perception. Wolf Unit, conflicted between its directive to protect Dr. Myles and suspicion of a trap, demands further proof of identity and intent, delaying immediate hostile action. Instead of initiating immediate full lockdown or aggression, Wolf Unit shifts to a cautious standoff, seeking to resolve the ambiguity before escalating. Red, meanwhile, monitors the situation via her drone, recognizing both the danger and the unusual stalling inside, and prepares to intervene once more is revealed.",

        "plot_change_note": "In the dialogue, Wolf Unit does not act solely as an intruder seeking the quantum drive but instead appears conflicted, prioritizing identification and protection of Dr. Myles over immediate acquisition or confrontation. Wolf Unit's willingness to delay escalation for further authentication and its language suggests a more nuanced directive (protecting Dr. Myles rather than just acquiring tech). The plot has been updated to reflect this cautious, protective stance and the ambiguous, identity-testing conversation, rather than a straightforward enemy infiltration. This more complex interaction is consistent with the dialogue and maintains character logic."
