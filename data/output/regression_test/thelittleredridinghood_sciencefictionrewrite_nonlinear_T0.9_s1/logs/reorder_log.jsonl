Introduce Red as she arrives at her grandmother’s pod, with no prior character introductions or context. Ensure Red’s reactions and observations convey unfamiliarity with current events—she is startled and uncertain, discovering her grandmother’s absence and the security breach for the first time. Carefully withhold any references to previous events or known antagonists; Red’s suspicion of Cyberwolf is based solely on the evidence she uncovers in this scene.", "transition_hint": "Open with a cold start: Red approaches the breached pod.

Use a flashback structure: transition from Red’s discovery of the breach (Chapter 4) to her recollection of the earlier ambush by Cyberwolf.

Present Cyberwolf as a new threat to both Red and the reader, ensuring their first meeting in the narrative.", "transition_hint": "After Red finds evidence of forced entry and the scrambled message, have her reflect on how the situation spiraled—cue a direct memory or sensory trigger (e.g., she touches her damaged bike or sees a scratch, leading into the flashback of the ambush).

Use a deeper flashback/interpolation: as Red recalls the ambush, have her mind drift further back to the origin of her mission—the assignment from Ms. Weaver. Characterize Red’s motivations and the stakes for her grandmother, filling in emotional and logistical context for the reader.", "transition_hint": "From the aftermath of the ambush flashback, use Red’s internal thoughts (e.g., questioning why she ever accepted the mission or missing the safety of the city) to slide into the memory of receiving the mission.
