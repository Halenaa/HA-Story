As she leans in, Red notices the jagged edges of the access panel pried loose, wires exposed and sparking. She runs her fingers along the cut, then pushes the door open, stepping inside. The interior lights flicker erratically, casting sharp shadows across overturned chairs and a smashed datapad on the floor. Red calls out, \"Grandma?\" but only the whirr of a ventilation fan answers. She moves swiftly to the back room, checking for signs of her grandmother, but finds only an empty laboratory coat draped over a stool and a faint, burnt-metal smell in the air. Red kneels to pick up the broken datapad, scanning its cracked screen for any clue. She glances at the wall display, which flashes a security override code she doesn't recognize—evidence that someone with advanced tech skills forced entry. Red’s eyes narrow as she studies the scene, her thoughts racing: only someone with knowledge of their security systems could have breached the pod. She quickly reconnects loose wiring on the security panel, attempting to access surveillance logs, and begins searching the pod for any hidden messages or signs of where her grandmother might have gone."}}

Suddenly, a sharp metallic scrape sliced through the quiet—Wolf-9 emerged from the brush, its synthetic fur bristling, optics flickering in predatory patterns. Its voice rasped through its speaker grille: 'Courier Red. Hand over the drive.' Without hesitation, Red ducked and rolled behind a fallen beam, flinging a maintenance drone into Wolf-9's path to distract it. Wolf-9 lunged, claws gouging into the drone's chassis, but Red darted away, her boots splashing through shallow puddles. Wolf-9 kept pace, recalibrating its targeting lens, announcing, 'You cannot evade me. The data belongs to us.' Red triggered a remote code on her wristpad, causing a nearby service hatch to slam shut, blocking Wolf-9's advance for a precious moment. Her objective remained clear: evade the Cyberwolf and reach the safety of Grandmother's lab. As Wolf-9 battered the hatch with relentless force, Red vanished into the mist, her every movement driven by the drive's importance and her determination to protect her family."}}

She checked the insulated satchel at her hip, feeling the hard edge of the data drive beneath her palm. Grandmother, bundled in a quilted lab coat and clutching a worn datapad, emerged from the shadowed path near the greenhouse, her eyes sharp beneath silver hair. She stepped quickly, glancing over her shoulder, and pressed a gloved hand to Red’s shoulder. 'You’ll take the drive directly to City Core—no detours. The androids are watching the central lifts,' Grandmother whispered, her breath forming a cloud in the cold air. She handed Red a small canister marked with hazard stripes. 'If you’re cornered, release the nanobots. They’ll buy you minutes, nothing more.' Red nodded, sliding the canister into her utility belt as Grandmother keyed a security override into her datapad, causing a maintenance hatch to hiss open in the undergrowth. Red ducked through the hatch, boots scraping over cold metal rungs, while Grandmother secured the hatch behind them, her fingers trembling just slightly. The dome’s hum grew fainter as Red dropped into the dim tunnel, the scent shifting to rust and oil. Above, Grandmother scanned the perimeter with a pocket scanner, watching for patrol bots. Their coordinated actions—Grandmother’s urgency and Red’s practiced movements—were driven by the knowledge that every second counted, and that failure meant losing not just the data, but each other."}}
