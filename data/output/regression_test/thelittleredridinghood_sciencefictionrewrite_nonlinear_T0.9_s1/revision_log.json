The updated plot adapts to the dialogue by having Dr. Weaver apparently present but behaving oddly, maintaining suspense and aligning with Red’s unease as indicated in the dialogue.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue reveals that Red and Wolf-9 are not in direct violent conflict but in a complex negotiation, with both pursuing leverage and discussing coalition oversight and data governance. This diverges from the original plot, which focused on a physical chase and Red's sole motivation to protect her family by evading Wolf-9. The updated plot reframes their interaction as a tense negotiation and ideological standoff, introducing a coalition and a more diplomatic, high-stakes exchange.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue reveals more about Grandmother's emotional state, her reluctance to use the nanobots, and the gravity of unleashing them (they erase threats entirely and have catastrophic consequences). It also clarifies her past promise regarding their use. The original plot implied urgency and the nanobots as a last resort, but did not specify the depth of hesitation or the catastrophic power. The updated plot incorporates these emotional and ethical stakes, aligning with the dialogue's expanded detail.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue depicts a much longer, more tense interaction than the original plot, where Red is forced to improvise repeatedly as Wolf-9 detects anomalies and demands escalating proof. Most notably, Wolf-9 explicitly transmits Red's data to rogue androids in her presence, and Red realizes she has been compromised, rather than only suspecting she is being tracked. The updated plot reflects this extended interrogation, Red's improvisation, and her explicit awareness of the data transfer to the rogue network.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shows Cyberwolf shifting from a menacing antagonist bent on extracting the drive through intimidation and threats, to a compassionate figure offering help and emotional support to Red regarding Grandmother's failing health. This is inconsistent with the original plot, which portrays Cyberwolf as relentless, strategic, and solely focused on his goal, with no sign of empathy or alliance. The updated plot introduces a sudden ceasefire and temporary alliance motivated by Grandmother's condition, altering the dynamics and stakes of the confrontation.",
