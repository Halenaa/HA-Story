She examines the unfamiliar wax seal, then tears it open, squinting at her grandmother's trembling script requesting urgent help. Driven by concern, Red packs her basket with bread and a jar of honey, tying her crimson cloak tightly around her shoulders. As she steps outside, Elias emerges from the shadows beside a leaning birch, his axe slung over his shoulder. He warns, 'The path is restless—something moves among the firs,' glancing toward the dim forest. Red insists she must reach her grandmother, her hand gripping the basket handle. Elias offers to escort her to the crossroads, his tone protective, but Red shakes her head and strides toward the woodland path, her boots crunching on gravel. Elias watches, jaw set, before following at a cautious distance, alert for signs of the Wolf. The scene ends with Red entering the woods, the scent of moss and woodsmoke rising as branches close behind her.",

She pauses to adjust her cloak and scan the undergrowth for movement, motivated by her concern for Grandmother and curiosity about the woods. The Wolf, watching from behind a bramble thicket, emerges onto the path, tail low, and greets her with exaggerated politeness, keen to win her trust and outwit Elias. He circles Red, sniffing the basket and asking pointed questions about her destination, attempting to divert her route toward the darker side trails. Red tightens her grip on the basket and responds cautiously, refusing to reveal the shortcut Elias taught her, and instead offers a firm, direct answer about visiting Grandmother. The Wolf, frustrated by her wariness, feigns friendliness and offers to show her a 'safer' way, while Red declines and continues forward, her attention sharpened by the Wolf's persistence. As Red moves off, the Wolf stalks her from a distance, plotting his next move.",

Elias emerges from behind a spruce, gripping his axe, his boots silent on the leaf litter. He steps into Red's path, blocking her way, and says, 'You shouldn't travel alone, not with the Wolf lurking.' Red hesitates, gripping her basket tighter, then says, 'My grandmother needs her medicine. I can't wait.' Elias scans the shadowed woods, his jaw set, and offers to escort her, motioning for Red to follow as he leads her off the main trail to a shortcut he knows. As they walk, Elias points out claw marks on a tree trunk, warning, 'The Wolf has been here recently.' Red nods, her eyes wide, and quickens her pace. Together, they reach the edge of Grandmother's clearing, Elias pausing to survey the area before waving Red forward. Elias's actions are driven by his desire to protect Red and atone for his past with the Wolf, while Red is determined to reach her grandmother despite the danger. The scene ends with both preparing to approach the cottage, alert and ready.",

Grandmother, weary but alert, rises from her rocking chair and peers through the window, recognizing the silhouette as unfamiliar. She grips her walking stick with both hands, voice steady as she calls, 'Who is there?' The Wolf deepens his tone, mimicking Red's voice, and replies, 'It's me, Grandmother—Red, come to visit.' Grandmother narrows her eyes and unlocks the door, but keeps the stick raised defensively. The Wolf pushes inside, sniffing the air for a human scent and scanning the room for hiding spots. As soon as the door closes, he lunges with a swift movement, grabbing Grandmother's arm and tying her wrists with a length of cord found by the hearth. He drags her gently but firmly to the wardrobe, hiding her among spare quilts and lavender sachets. The Wolf then rummages through her shawls, selecting one and draping it over his shoulders as he settles into bed, rehearsing Red's name in a husky whisper. His clear objective is to masquerade as Grandmother, awaiting Red's arrival; Grandmother's defensive actions are motivated by her suspicion and desire to protect herself and her granddaughter.",

Red retrieves a scrap of red cloth snagged on the trap, recognizing it from her grandmother’s cloak, and urgently says, 'We need to warn her—he’s getting closer.' Elias nods, swinging his axe to disable the trap, and together they hurry toward the cottage, alert for any sign of the Wolf’s presence.",

The Wolf snarls, snapping at the axe handle, but Red hurls the skillet, striking the Wolf’s muzzle with a ringing clang. Dazed, the Wolf staggers back, giving Elias time to bind its legs with a length of rope. Breathing hard, Red stands over the subdued Wolf and says, 'You won’t trick us again.'
