Red's urgency and emotional state are more pronounced, expressing excitement and worry about her grandmother repeatedly. These changes require updating the plot to reflect Red's mistrust, her active questioning, and her emotional volatility. Elias's acceptance of her mistrust and reassurance are also foregrounded. The core plot remains, but the emotional dynamics and motivations are more explicit and nuanced in the updated version.",

The Wolf struggles to mimic Red convincingly and tries to coax her with more elaborate lies, but does not immediately gain entry. The updated plot maintains character logic, highlighting Grandmother's resilience and the Wolf's cunning, but reflects a more prolonged standoff at the doorway rather than an immediate entry and attack.",
