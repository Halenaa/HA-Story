# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Letter and Sets Out

Red stoops to retrieve a sealed letter slipped beneath her door, her fingers brushing the coarse parchment.

She examines the unfamiliar wax seal, then tears it open, squinting at her grandmother's trembling script requesting urgent help.

Driven by concern, Red packs her basket with bread and a jar of honey, tying her crimson cloak tightly around her shoulders.

As she steps outside, Elias emerges from the shadows beside a leaning birch, his axe slung over his shoulder.

He warns, 'The path is restless—something moves among the firs,' glancing toward the dim forest.

Elias narrows his eyes, scanning the darkness between the firs, his hand unconsciously drifting closer to his belt knife. "We should be cautious. I don't like the way the shadows shift tonight—there's something out there, watching us from the trees." ——Elias

Red insists she must reach her grandmother, her hand gripping the basket handle.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grasp on the basket, glancing anxiously at the looming trees before stepping forward with renewed determination. "I can't slow down now. Grandma's depending on me—and she hasn't been well lately. Whatever's out here in the woods, I have to get to her. I promised." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias offers to escort her to the crossroads, his tone protective, but Red shakes her head and strides toward the woodland path, her boots crunching on gravel.

Elias steps forward, his brow furrowed with concern, extending a hand as if to gently stop her. "Are you sure you don't want company to the crossroads, Red? It's getting late, and the woods aren't always kind to wanderers." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red flashes him a reassuring smile, pulling her crimson cloak tighter as she steps confidently onto the shadowed path. "Thank you, Elias, but I know these woods better than anyone—I'll be fine." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias watches, jaw set, before following at a cautious distance, alert for signs of the Wolf.

The scene ends with Red entering the woods, the scent of moss and woodsmoke rising as branches close behind her.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Wolf

Red, clutching her basket of bread and herbs, steps carefully along the path, her boots pressing into the muddy earth.

She pauses to adjust her cloak and scan the undergrowth for movement, motivated by her concern for Grandmother and curiosity about the woods.

The Wolf, watching from behind a bramble thicket, emerges onto the path, tail low, and greets her with exaggerated politeness, keen to win her trust and outwit Elias.

The Wolf steps from the shadows, dipping his head and curling his tail in an exaggerated show of deference. His eyes glint with a practiced warmth as he flashes a courteous smile, watching Red closely for any sign of suspicion. "Ah, my dear young traveler! What a fine morning for a walk in the woods, wouldn't you agree? Forgive me if I startled you—I do hope you’ll accept my humble greeting. It’s not every day I cross paths with someone so bright and brave. Might I ask, are you headed somewhere special?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket a little closer, eyeing the Wolf with a polite but uncertain smile. "Oh—thank you, sir, but I suppose I'm just on my way to visit my grandmother; she lives just beyond the tall pines." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf tilts his head, ears perked, feigning innocent curiosity as he steps gracefully closer, careful to keep his posture unthreatening. "How delightful! A devoted granddaughter—how rare and admirable; tell me, does your dear grandmother live alone, or is she expecting company this fine morning?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her basket from one arm to the other, glancing uncertainly at the Wolf as if weighing whether to trust his friendly tone. "She lives alone, just her and her old cat—I bring her treats so she won’t be lonely." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf leans in just slightly, sniffing the air with a practiced smile, eyes glinting with interest. "How thoughtful you are, my dear—such kindness deserves reward; and tell me, what delicious treats might you be carrying today?" ——The Wolf

He circles Red, sniffing the basket and asking pointed questions about her destination, attempting to divert her route toward the darker side trails.

The Wolf prowls in a slow circle around Red, his nose twitching as he sniffs at the woven basket, a glint of curiosity—and something sharper—in his yellow eyes. "Well, well, what do we have here? Out all alone in the woods, are we? That’s a rather heavy basket you’re carrying, my dear. Tell me—where might you be heading on such a fine morning?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket a little tighter, offering the Wolf a polite but cautious smile as she keeps to the sun-dappled path. "Oh, I'm just on my way to visit my grandmother—she lives at the edge of the woods, past the old mill." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf tilts his head, gesturing with his snout toward a shadowy, lesser-known trail that twists away from the main road. "How thoughtful of you, but the path you’re on is long and terribly dull—have you ever tried the shortcut through the silver birches?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches the basket a little tighter and glances down the familiar trail, her brow furrowing in cautious politeness as she tries not to offend the stranger. "Thank you, but Mama says I must always stay on the main path, even if it's not the quickest." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his voice to a gentle murmur, edging a step closer as he gestures invitingly toward the shadowy side trail. "Ah, but sometimes mothers worry too much—after all, the main path is so crowded and noisy, while the birch trail is quiet, cool, and lined with wildflowers your grandmother would surely adore." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket closer, glancing past the Wolf down the familiar sunlit path, her steps hesitating but her resolve steady. "That does sound lovely, but Mama says wildflowers can hide thorns, and I promised to bring Grandmother only the bread and honey she likes best." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf edges a step closer, his gaze flickering toward the darker path, voice low and coaxing. "Bread and honey, you say—how very sweet; but imagine how delighted she’d be if you surprised her with a handful of fresh dewberries from the thicket just beyond the birches." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket a little tighter, glancing uncertainly toward the direction the Wolf suggested, her steps slowing as she weighs his tempting offer against her mother’s warning. "Oh, I’m sure Grandmother would love dewberries, but Mama says I mustn’t dawdle or leave the path, and I don’t want to break my promise." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf tilts his head, his voice low and inviting, gesturing subtly toward a shadowed trail veering off the main path. "Promises are precious, little one, yet sometimes the woods themselves whisper secrets worth hearing—might you not listen, just for a moment?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket a bit tighter and glances nervously at the shadowy trails, edging a step closer to the sunlit main path. "I do love stories and secrets, but Mama says the woods can be tricky, so I must keep my ears open and my feet on the path." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf edges closer, lowering his voice to a velvet purr as he gestures invitingly toward the shadowy birch trail. "Oh, but it’s only those who wander a little who find the tastiest treats and the most marvelous tales, don’t you think?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket closer, glancing ahead to where the sunlight spills across the main path. "Maybe, but Mama says the best tales are the ones you can share safely at home." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his voice, leaning closer as his tail flicks, eyes glinting with sly encouragement. "Ah, but what if the very best tale is waiting just a few steps off your path, ready to be discovered by someone brave enough to stray?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket a bit tighter and takes a careful step back toward the main path, glancing at the Wolf with polite firmness. "I think Grandmother will be happiest knowing I arrived safe and sound, with her story right beside her." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red tightens her grip on the basket and responds cautiously, refusing to reveal the shortcut Elias taught her, and instead offers a firm, direct answer about visiting Grandmother.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red keeps her eyes steady on the path, her fingers tightening around the woven handle of her basket, making sure not to stray from her story or give away anything more than necessary. "I'm on my way to visit my Grandmother and bring her some treats. She's been feeling poorly, so I thought a basket of fresh bread and sweet berries might cheer her up." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf steps a little closer, his gaze lingering on the basket, a sly smile playing at the edge of his mouth. "Oh, how thoughtful of you—though these woods hide many paths and dangers; are you quite certain you know the safest way to Grandmother’s house?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts the basket to her other arm, her eyes steady on the Wolf, signaling she has no intention of discussing alternate routes. "Thank you for your concern, but I know the way well enough and won't stray from the main path." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf leans in closer, his voice low and silky, eyes glinting as he studies Red's grip on the basket. "The main path can be lonely, little one—sometimes those who walk it never return; wouldn't you rather share with me how you came by your route, so I might watch over you?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her basket protectively against her side and takes a careful step away from the Wolf, eyes scanning the path ahead. "I appreciate your offer, but I prefer to walk alone—Grandmother is expecting me, and I mustn't delay." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf leans in closer, his eyes narrowing with a sly, toothy grin as he blocks a bit more of the path ahead. "Such resolve for someone so small—yet, if you’re so sure of yourself, you won’t mind telling me just how far it is to Grandmother’s cottage, will you?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts the basket protectively to her other arm, her eyes never leaving the wolf's face as she steps forward along the path. "It's not far now, just beyond the old willow—thank you, but I'll be fine on my own." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf's eyes narrow, and he steps subtly closer, his tone smooth but edged with an unsettling promise. "Ah, beyond the old willow—how fortunate, for I know every inch of these woods and could lead you straight there, should your feet falter." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the basket and glances warily at the Wolf, keeping a steady pace along the path. "Thank you, but I trust my own steps and prefer to rely on what Grandmother taught me about these woods." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes glinting as he circles Red, testing the distance between them and watching for hesitation. "Ah, but sometimes what is taught can be mistaken—wouldn’t you rather let someone with sharper senses guide you, in case trouble finds you before you find Grandmother?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her basket higher onto her arm, glancing briefly toward the willow while keeping a wary eye on the Wolf. "I believe Grandmother’s wisdom will keep me safe, and I wouldn’t want to trouble you when I’m already so close." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes glinting as he blocks a sliver of the path, testing Red's determination. "So close, yet danger often waits in a single misstep—are you certain you won't reconsider my company, little one?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the basket, her gaze steady but wary, and takes another step down the path, determined to keep moving. "I'm certain; Grandmother says caution is my best companion, and I'll trust her advice above all else." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf, frustrated by her wariness, feigns friendliness and offers to show her a 'safer' way, while Red declines and continues forward, her attention sharpened by the Wolf's persistence.

The Wolf steps out from behind a mossy tree, lips curled in a benign smile, gesturing with a paw toward a shadowed detour, eyes lingering on Red as if sizing up her resolve. "Ah, little one, the woods can be treacherous for those who rush ahead. You know, I've roamed these paths longer than most. There's a gentler trail just beyond that thicket—less brambles, more sunlight. Wouldn't you rather walk where it's safe?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her eyes scanning the Wolf's face for any flicker of ulterior motive. "Thank you, but Grandmother trusts the path she taught me—and I promised to stick to it, no matter how tempting another way may seem." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf tilts his head, a smile lingering too long, eyes tracking Red's guarded steps as she grips her basket tighter and quickens her pace. "Of course, such dutifulness is rare; still, if you tire or falter, remember, I am always nearby to guide you." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket and glances sidelong at the Wolf, her pace steady but alert as she continues down the familiar path. "Your kindness is noted, but I don't plan to stray—or tire—so I'll be just fine on my own." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

As Red moves off, the Wolf stalks her from a distance, plotting his next move.

# Chapter 3: Elias Intervenes and Offers Help

Red strides quickly along the winding path, basket in hand, her red cloak brushing against ferns and brambles as she glances over her shoulder at every snap of twig.

Elias emerges from behind a spruce, gripping his axe, his boots silent on the leaf litter.

He steps into Red's path, blocking her way, and says, 'You shouldn't travel alone, not with the Wolf lurking.

Elias steps squarely into Red's path, his expression tense and wary, glancing nervously at the shadowy trees around them. "Red, wait! You shouldn't travel alone, not with the Wolf lurking. It's not safe in these woods." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, gripping her basket tighter as she stands her ground, refusing to back away. "I can take care of myself, Elias, but if you know something about the Wolf, you'd better tell me now." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias lowers his voice, glancing nervously between the trees as if expecting the Wolf to emerge. "It's not just stories, Red—the Wolf was seen near the river last night, and someone found torn cloth and blood." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red grips her basket tighter, her jaw set, and glances down the shadowy path toward her grandmother's cottage. "If that's true, I need to warn my grandmother and get her to safety—no one else will do it." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias steps aside but keeps close to Red, his hand hovering near the hilt of his knife, watching the shadows between the trees. "Let me come with you, Red—if the Wolf's out there, two pairs of eyes are better than one." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps back, her grip tightening on her basket as she scans Elias's face for any sign of deception. "I don't know if I can trust you, Elias—sometimes the Wolf isn't the only thing hiding in these woods." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias steps aside just enough to show he's willing to follow her lead, but his eyes scan the shadows beyond the path. "I get why you don't trust me, Red, but I'd rather face your suspicion than leave you to face the Wolf alone." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red adjusts her cloak and steps forward, glancing warily at Elias before continuing down the path toward her grandmother's cottage. "Fine, Elias—just keep your eyes open and your hands where I can see them." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

' Red hesitates, gripping her basket tighter, and challenges Elias, demanding he share what he knows about the Wolf.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances down at the small bottle nestled inside her basket, worry etched across her face as she shifts her weight anxiously. "I have to hurry—my grandmother's been feeling worse lately. If I don't get this medicine to her soon. I just can't bear the thought of her suffering alone." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias reveals that the Wolf was seen near the river last night, with torn cloth and blood found nearby, intensifying the danger.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her basket from one arm to the other and glances down the winding forest path, bouncing on her toes with anticipation. "Oh, I just can't wait to get to Grandma's house! The woods seem longer than ever today, and I have so many treats in my basket to share with her. I wonder if she'll be surprised to see me so early." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red quickens her pace, clutching her basket tighter as she glances eagerly down the winding path. "Every step feels slower than the last, but I keep imagining Grandma's smile when I walk through her door!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red adjusts her basket and quickens her pace along the wooded path. "Maybe if I walk a little faster, I’ll get there before lunchtime and we can have our picnic together!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red quickens her pace, gripping her basket tightly as she scans the path ahead. "I keep peeking through the trees, hoping Grandma's cottage will appear any second—I'm just so excited to give her these treats!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's determination grows—she insists on warning her grandmother and getting her to safety, showing increased urgency and concern for her grandmother's worsening illness.

Elias scans the undergrowth, his hand resting on the hilt of his knife, then motions firmly for Red to follow, stepping confidently into the shadowed side trail. "Stay close, Red. These woods aren't always forgiving, especially off the main path. But I know a shortcut that'll get us to your grandmother's cottage before nightfall." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances over her shoulder at the familiar path, then tightens her grip on her basket, stepping cautiously after Elias into the thicket. "Are you sure this is safe, Elias? I've never strayed from the trail before." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias glances over his shoulder to reassure Red, his steady gaze lingering until she nods and steps closer to his side. "Trust me, I wouldn't lead you astray—I've walked these woods more times than I can count." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances back at the fading main path, then steps closer to Elias, clutching her basket a little tighter as she follows him into the deeper shadows of the forest. "Alright, Elias—I trust you; just promise you won't let anything happen to me." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias offers to escort her, acknowledging Red's mistrust and expressing a preference to face her suspicion rather than leave her alone.

Elias stops abruptly beside a scarred tree, tracing the deep grooves with his fingers, his eyes scanning the surrounding shadows as he speaks in a low, urgent voice. "Look here, Red—these claw marks are fresh. The Wolf has been here, and not long ago either. We need to be careful; this isn't just any animal's doing." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps closer, tracing the rough gouges with trembling fingers, her voice barely above a whisper. "Are you sure it's the Wolf, Elias? It looks so. deep—like he was angry." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Elias glances nervously over his shoulder, tightening his grip on his walking stick as the forest seems to grow quieter around them. "I'm certain—no other creature in these woods leaves marks like this, and when the Wolf is angry, it means he's hunting." ——Elias

Red grudgingly accepts, instructing Elias to keep his hands visible and expressing her anxiety and excitement about reaching her grandmother, revealing a blend of urgency and childlike anticipation.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter, glancing nervously over her shoulder as she hurries down the winding path, her footsteps crunching louder in the hush of the forest. "Okay, just keep going, Red. Nothing out here but trees and shadows. Grandma's house isn't far now—don't look back, don't slow down." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket closer and glances nervously over her shoulder, her pace quickening as the path narrows. "Every twig snapping sounds like footsteps—just my imagination, right?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket tighter and hurries her steps, glancing nervously at the dark spaces between the trees. "Wish these woods weren't so quiet—it's like they're holding their breath, waiting for something." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

As they walk off the main trail, Elias points out fresh claw marks, warning that the Wolf is angry and hunting.

Red questions Elias's certainty but agrees to press on, her nerves heightened by the eerie silence of the woods and her vivid imagination.

Together, they reach the edge of Grandmother's clearing, Elias pausing to survey the area before waving Red forward.

Both are alert, ready, and Red is motivated both by her grandmother's need and her own independence, while Elias is intent on protecting her and atoning for his past.

The chapter ends with their approach to the cottage, tense and vigilant.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: The Wolf Reaches Grandmother's Cottage First

The Wolf, his fur damp from the rain, pads quietly across the muddy path and scratches at the cottage door with calculated gentleness.

Grandmother, weary but alert, rises from her rocking chair and peers through the window, recognizing the silhouette as unfamiliar.

She grips her walking stick with both hands, voice steady as she calls, 'Who is there?

GrandmotherShe tightens her hold on the walking stick, eyes squinting into the shadows, her posture rigid with caution. "I may be old, but my ears still work just fine. If you're here for trouble, you've come to the wrong doorstep. Show yourself, now—don't keep an old woman guessing." ——Grandmother

' The Wolf, attempting to mimic Red's voice but struggling to soften his naturally rough tone, replies, 'It's me, Grandmother—Red, come to visit.

The Wolf curls his lips into a sly grin, softening his growl into a sweet, familiar tone. He stands just outside the door, listening for any movement inside, eager to see if his deception will work. "Grandmother, it's me—Red Riding Hood! I brought you some fresh bread and sweet butter, just like you asked. May I come in?" ——The Wolf

' Grandmother, unconvinced by the unconvincing imitation, stands her ground and demands, 'Show yourself, now—don't keep an old woman guessing.

' The Wolf, realizing his ruse is less effective than hoped, persists by elaborating on Red's supposed visit, mentioning bread and butter, as he tries to coax Grandmother into letting him in.

Grandmother's suspicion only grows, and she keeps the door firmly locked, stick at the ready.

The Wolf, growing impatient, attempts to sound gentler but fails to fully mask his roughness, continuing to plead with increasing urgency.

Ultimately, sensing the Wolf's intent, Grandmother refuses to open the door, forcing the Wolf to consider alternative, possibly more forceful, means of entry.

The Wolf tugs the shawl tighter around his hairy shoulders, lips pulling back in a crooked grin as he settles his bulk into the bed. He clears his throat, swallowing down a growl, and practices again, softer, almost sweet: "Red. dear, sweet Red.". ""Red. dear Red," he murmurs, rolling the name on his tongue, rough voice straining for a gentler timbre. "Come closer, my child. Come in, Red."," ——The Wolf

The WolfHe adjusts the shawl tighter around his shoulders, lips curling in a practiced smile as he softens his growl to a trembling, inviting croon. "Red, sweet child, don't be shy—your old grandmother is waiting." ——The Wolf

The Wolf’s objective remains to get inside and masquerade as Grandmother, but Grandmother’s perceptiveness and firmness delay his scheme.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red and Elias Discover the Wolf's Trap

Red kneels beside a cluster of broken twigs, her fingers probing the soil until she uncovers a cleverly disguised steel trap.

Elias stands behind her, scanning the tree line, his axe gripped tightly and boots crunching on wet leaves.

Red pulls back a length of wire, revealing a fresh paw print stamped into the mud, while Elias examines the trap’s mechanism and mutters, 'He's adapting—these weren't here yesterday.

' Red retrieves a scrap of red cloth snagged on the trap, recognizing it from her grandmother’s cloak, and urgently says, 'We need to warn her—he’s getting closer.

' Elias nods, swinging his axe to disable the trap, and together they hurry toward the cottage, alert for any sign of the Wolf’s presence.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Red's Bold Rescue and Elias's Sacrifice

Red, clutching her woven basket, moves swiftly along a narrow path, her red cloak snagging on brambles as she scans the undergrowth for signs of her grandmother.

Elias, breathing heavily, catches up and quietly gestures for Red to stop, pointing to fresh wolf tracks pressed into the muddy earth.

Elias draws his axe and instructs Red to approach the cottage from the rear while he circles around to distract the Wolf.

Elias grips his axe tighter, nods firmly to Red, and starts circling quietly toward the front of the cottage, eyes scanning for the Wolf. "Red, take the back way—I'll draw the Wolf's attention up front. Wait for my signal before you move in. We only get one shot at this, so keep sharp." ——Elias

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red silently slips away through the thicket, eyes fixed on the cottage's rear entrance, steadying her breath as she prepares to act. "Understood, Elias—I'll be ready at the back and wait for your signal." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

As Red creeps toward the back door, her fingers brush rough bark and she listens for any sign of danger, determined to reach her grandmother.

Elias stomps on dry branches and shouts a warning, luring the Wolf away from the cottage.

Elias stomps hard on a pile of dry branches, snapping them loudly. He raises his voice, standing tall and glaring at the Wolf, making himself an obvious and tempting target away from the cottage. "Hey! Over here, you filthy beast! If it’s a real challenge you want, leave the cottage and face me!" ——Elias

The Wolf slinks from the shadows, hackles raised and golden eyes fixed on Elias, circling closer with a low, rumbling growl. "Ah, so the little lamb wants to play the hero—tell me, Elias, do you truly believe you can outrun my hunger?" ——The Wolf

Elias snaps another branch and hurls it into the shadows, backing deeper into the trees to draw the Wolf away. "Maybe not outrun it—but I can give you a chase you won’t forget, if you’ve got the guts to follow!" ——Elias

The Wolf lowers its head, eyes gleaming, and prowls toward Elias, abandoning its post by the cottage door. "Brave words for trembling legs—let’s see if your heart is as tough as your tongue, boy." ——The Wolf

Their coordinated actions allow Red to slip inside, where she finds her grandmother weak but unharmed, and Elias faces the Wolf in the clearing, ready to defend them both.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Wolf's Defeat and Red's Confession

Red presses her back against the rough bark of an ancient oak, clutching a heavy iron skillet in her left hand, her red cloak snagging on a bramble.

Elias crouches nearby, gripping his axe, eyes scanning the forest for movement.

The Wolf circles the cottage, paws silent on the damp earth, tongue flicking over his fangs as he tries to catch Red's scent.

Red signals to Elias with a quick nod, then darts out to distract the Wolf, luring him toward the woodpile.

As the Wolf lunges, Elias swings his axe, burying the blade deep in a fallen log to block the Wolf’s path.

The Wolf snarls, snapping at the axe handle, but Red hurls the skillet, striking the Wolf’s muzzle with a ringing clang.

Dazed, the Wolf staggers back, giving Elias time to bind its legs with a length of rope.

Breathing hard, Red stands over the subdued Wolf and says, 'You won’t trick us again.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands tall, clutching her cloak tightly, her eyes unwavering as she glares down at the defeated Wolf. "It's over, Wolf. You won’t trick us again—no more lies, no more disguises. I see you for what you are now, and I won't let you hurt anyone else." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lifts his head weakly, a sly glint lingering in his eyes despite his battered state. "You think you've won, Red, but the forest is full of shadows—and not all of them are mine." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes unwavering as she steps forward, casting the Wolf into the moonlit shadow behind her. "Maybe the forest is dark, but your reign of fear ends tonight." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

' Elias drags the Wolf away from the cottage, while Red brushes pine needles from her cloak and turns toward the door, determination in her stride.
