        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue deepens the relationship between Red and Wolf, introducing mutual vulnerability, trust, and the possibility of partnership rather than pure confrontation. Wolf is more openly protective and invested in Red's fate, and Red is willing to consider Wolf's offer of guidance while asserting her independence. This shifts the plot from an impending confrontation to a complicated alliance, requiring an updated plot summary to reflect these nuanced interactions.",

The tone is more urgent and hints at supernatural or external changes, prompting Grandmother to prepare for more than just a visit from Red. The plot has been updated to reflect this shift from a simple, wary encounter to one charged with suspense and wider danger.",

Instead of simply exposing Wolf’s ruse by pulling his tail, Red interrogates Wolf, uncovers the letter, and reacts to his confession about manipulating their meeting. The updated plot integrates these new developments while maintaining character motivations and logical progression.",
