The sound of shifting leaves caught her ear, and she turned to find the Wolf watching her from behind a gnarled tree, his fur bristling and nose twitching. Motivated to prove herself capable, Red squared her shoulders and demanded his purpose for blocking her route. Wolf, driven by a desire to impress and connect, circled closer, brushing past low ferns and lowering his head in a dramatic bow. He offered her a warning about hunters prowling nearby, his eyes flicking toward the darker thicket. Red, determined not to show fear, sidestepped him and pressed onward, but Wolf matched her pace, pacing at her side with deliberate steps. Their footsteps stirred the mud and scattered acorns, and the tension between them grew with each exchanged glance and clipped remark, setting the stage for an unavoidable confrontation.",

The woods are full of surprises—maybe some are dangerous, some are not.' Red weighed her options, then offered, 'If you show me the safest way, I’ll share some treats.'
