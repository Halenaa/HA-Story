The Wolf’s ears perked, and he nodded, 'A fair deal. But only if you promise not to mention me to anyone you meet.' Red agreed, and together they moved deeper into the woods, Red keeping a wary pace beside him. The Wolf led her past a tangle of roots, gesturing with his snout, and Red watched every movement, determined not to let her guard down until she reached her goal."}}
