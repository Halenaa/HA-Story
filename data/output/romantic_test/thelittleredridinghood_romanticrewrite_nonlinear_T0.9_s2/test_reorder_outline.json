        "title": "Red and Wolf Clash and Reveal Hidden Feelings",
        "summary": "Red demands answers from Wolf, who confesses his motivation: he admires Red and wanted to create a dramatic meeting to win her heart. The grandmother, freed from the closet, scolds both Red for her risky choices and Wolf for his deception. Red must decide whether to forgive the Wolf or send him away.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting confrontation, emotional reveal",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited (Red's perspective), past tense. Begin with Red and the Wolf's confrontation, ensuring the reader understands this is their apparent first major interaction. Carefully seed hints about their personalities and motivations, but avoid assuming reader familiarity with their backstory. Let grandmother's intervention subtly introduce their deeper feelings, without explicit prior romantic context.",
        "transition_hint": "Open in medias res with sensory/emotional cues (Red’s pounding heart, Wolf’s nervous glances), then allow the confrontation to unfold. After the chapter, gently prompt a transition into Red’s memory of how she got here."

        "narrative_role": "First fateful meeting, deal struck",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited (Red’s perspective), past tense. Narrate Red’s first encounter with the Wolf, focusing on her wariness and curiosity. Ensure their dialog and mannerisms reflect unfamiliarity, with tension and intrigue.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition using a clear flashback marker: e.g., 'Just hours earlier, as Red set out through the woods…' or by having Red recall the moment when she first saw the Wolf."

        "narrative_role": "Wolf’s cunning, plot setup",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited (Red’s perspective, but when Red is absent, focus on Wolf’s observable actions from an external point of view, never entering Wolf’s thoughts). Past tense. Describe the Wolf’s arrival at the cottage and his interaction with Grandmother as Red would imagine or later learn it.",
        "transition_hint": "Return to present with a line like, 'Meanwhile, unknown to Red, the Wolf had…', smoothly guiding the reader out of flashback."
