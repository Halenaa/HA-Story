Her mother, frowning with concern, places a sealed letter atop the parcel and slides it toward Scarlett with a gentle but firm push. 'Take this to your grandmother, but do not stray from the path,' she instructs, her voice low and urgent. Scarlett nods, securing the package in her basket, then stands and pulls her cloak tighter against the morning chill. She glances out the window toward the shadowy edge of the woods, curiosity flickering in her eyes. Her mother grips her arm briefly, squeezing reassurance into her hand before letting her go. Scarlett steps outside, her boots crunching on frost-laced grass, and sets off toward the forest’s looming, mist-shrouded trees, determined to reach her grandmother swiftly and prove her responsibility.",

Lucian, his axe slung over his shoulder, steps from behind a birch tree, barring her way with a firm but gentle stance. He scans the woods, eyes alert, and asks in a low voice why she is alone so deep in the forest. Scarlett straightens, declaring her intent to reach her grandmother’s cottage and refusing to turn back. Lucian warns her of fresh wolf tracks nearby, kneeling to point out claw marks in the mud. Scarlett hesitates, then insists she must continue, glancing down at the tracks before stepping past Lucian. Lucian, motivated to protect her, follows at a distance, pausing to listen for distant howls and watching for movement among the trees.",

Viktor, disguised in Grandmother's nightgown and cap, lies stiffly in the creaky bed, the coarse linen scratching his fur beneath the covers. Scarlett sets her wicker basket on the oak table and approaches, narrowing her eyes at Viktor's twitching nose poking from beneath the blanket. She leans closer, inspecting the long, clawed hands gripping the quilt, and asks in a steady voice, 'Grandmother, what big hands you have.' Viktor, forcing his voice into a quavering imitation, replies, 'All the better to hold you with, my dear,' while curling his claws tighter around the sheet. Scarlett silently steps back, keeping one hand near the fireplace poker as she scans the room for signs of her real grandmother, determined to uncover the deception.",

Lucian approaches, his boots leaving deep prints in the soft soil, and warns Scarlett that Viktor has been spotted near the cottage. Scarlett insists she must reach her grandmother, her determination evident as she moves past Lucian, brushing aside low branches. Lucian, motivated by a need to protect Scarlett, blocks her path and offers to escort her, his eyes darting to the shifting undergrowth. Their voices echo quietly in the stillness, Lucian advising caution while Scarlett argues for her independence. Ultimately, Lucian agrees to accompany her, walking at her side as they continue toward the cottage, their footsteps muffled by the damp moss.",

Viktor rises slowly, ears twitching, and addresses Scarlett directly: 'I have not come to harm you or your family. I am not what I seem.' Lucian steps forward, blocking Scarlett with his arm, but Scarlett moves past him, determined to get answers. Viktor, voice low and rough, confesses his curse and explains that he seeks redemption, not revenge. Lucian lowers his axe but keeps it ready, demanding proof. Scarlett retrieves a faded family portrait from the mantle, noticing Viktor’s recognition of the faces, and insists they listen. The scene ends with Viktor revealing details of his past and Scarlett agreeing to help him, while Lucian warily accepts a fragile truce, keeping watch by the window as night falls.",

Scarlett steps between Viktor and her grandmother, her voice steady: 'I won't let you harm her. If you want to break your curse, you must prove you can choose compassion.' Viktor hesitates, then lowers his head and nudges a small wildflower onto the bed, his tail drooping. Scarlett, recognizing the gesture, sets the flower in a cup of water and says, 'You’re not only a beast when you choose kindness.' The room grows quiet except for the crackle of the fire, and as Viktor's fur begins to shimmer, the first signs of the spell's unraveling appear, marking the turning point in his fate.",
