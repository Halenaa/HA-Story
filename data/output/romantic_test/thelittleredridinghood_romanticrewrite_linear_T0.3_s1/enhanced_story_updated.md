# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Letter and Sets Off

Scarlett sits at the table, tying the red ribbon of her cloak while her mother slices a loaf of warm bread and wraps it in cloth.

Her mother, with a mix of concern and gentle encouragement, places a sealed letter atop the parcel and slides it toward Scarlett.

'Take this to your grandmother, but do not stray from the path,' she urges, her voice both loving and serious.

Scarlett, clearly curious about the mysterious woods and their secrets, lets her curiosity show as she gazes out the window toward the shadowy trees.

She wonders aloud about what lies within the forest and considers how different it looks at dusk, expressing a longing to discover its mysteries.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett leans closer to the window, her breath fogging the glass ever so slightly as her gaze lingers on the shadowy tree line. "Those woods always look so different at dusk. It's as if they're hiding secrets I can't quite see from here. I wonder what's really out there." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett leans forward, pressing her palm to the cool glass and peering more intently into the gathering darkness. "Maybe if I just took a few steps closer, I'd finally discover what makes the shadows dance between the trees." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Her mother, both cautious and supportive, reminds Scarlett to be careful and reassures her that it’s okay to feel brave while still being careful.

Scarlett's MotherShe squeezes Scarlett’s arm gently, her eyes lingering with worry and affection before releasing her hand. "Scarlett, remember to stay on the path and keep your eyes open. I know you’re brave, but it’s okay to be careful too. I’ll be thinking of you every step of the way." ——Scarlett's Mother

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett squeezes her mother's hand in return, offering a small but determined smile. "I promise I’ll be careful, Mama—and I’ll come straight back after I visit Grandma." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Scarlett promises to be careful and to come straight back after visiting her grandmother, determined to prove her responsibility while also satisfying her curiosity.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)She tightens her red cloak around her shoulders, takes a steadying breath, and steps forward, boots crunching as she heads resolutely into the misty forest. "All right, Scarlett, you can do this. Grandmother’s counting on you, and you won’t let her down—not today." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

She steels herself, reminding herself of her grandmother’s need and her own resolve, then sets off toward the misty woods, her curiosity and sense of duty guiding her steps.

----------------------------------------

Uncertainty hangs in the air as Scarlett leaves the familiar path behind, letting the shadowed trees swallow her silhouette. With each step deeper into the woods, the world grows quieter, and the sense that she is not alone begins to take root. Unbeknownst to Scarlett, her journey is about to take an unexpected turn, as the forest holds more than just tangled branches and hidden trails.

# Chapter 2: Scarlett Encounters the Mysterious Stranger

Scarlett, gripping her wicker basket, navigates around tangled roots and pushes aside a curtain of ferns to clear her path.

Lucian, his axe slung over his shoulder, steps from behind a birch tree, barring her way with a firm but gentle stance.

He scans the woods, eyes alert, and asks in a low voice why she is alone so deep in the forest.

Lucian narrows his eyes, scanning the shadowed trees for any sign of movement, his hand instinctively resting near the hilt of his blade. "You shouldn't wander these woods alone. What brings you so deep into the forest at this hour?" ——Lucian

Scarlett straightens, declaring her intent to reach her grandmother’s cottage and refusing to turn back.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett lifts her chin defiantly, tightening her grip on the basket as she looks Lucian in the eye. "No, Lucian. I won't turn back—not now. My grandmother is waiting, and I promised I'd bring her this basket. The woods may be dark, but I know the path. I can do this." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian steps forward, concern etched in his eyes as he gently positions himself beside Scarlett, ready to accompany her on the path. "Scarlett, your courage is clear, but the forest holds more than shadows—at least let me walk beside you, so neither of us faces its dangers alone." ——Lucian

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett tightens her grip on the basket, her gaze steady and unwavering as she steps forward onto the path. "I appreciate your offer, Lucian, but this is something I must do on my own—my promise to her matters more than my fear." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian warns her of fresh wolf tracks nearby, kneeling to point out claw marks in the mud.

Lucian kneels by the muddy path, brushing away wet leaves to reveal the sharp, unmistakable claw marks. His voice is low and urgent as he gestures for Scarlett to come closer and see for herself. "Scarlett, look—these tracks are fresh. See how the mud’s still damp inside the prints? The claws dug deep; this wasn’t just a stray. It passed through less than an hour ago, maybe even less." ——Lucian

Scarlett hesitates, then insists she must continue, glancing down at the tracks before stepping past Lucian.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett hesitates at the edge of the tracks, her fingers clutching the basket tightly. She takes a shaky breath, then steps forward, resolutely moving past Lucian while trying to mask her uncertainty. "I. I know this path is dangerous, Lucian. You don't have to remind me. But I can't turn back now—not when I've come this far. Grandma's waiting, and I promised I'd bring her what she needs. Please, let me pass." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian steps sideways, his arm slightly outstretched as if to bar her way, concern etched deep in his eyes. "Scarlett, just because you've come this far doesn't mean you have to go alone—let me help you, or at least wait until the fog clears." ——Lucian

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett tightens her grip on her basket, her jaw set, as she steps firmly past Lucian onto the shadowed path. "I appreciate your concern, but if I wait any longer, I might lose my nerve—and I can't let fear decide for me." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian steps aside reluctantly, his eyes fixed on Scarlett as she moves past, worry etched across his face. "Then at least promise me you'll call if anything seems wrong—I don't want to lose you to the woods too." ——Lucian

Lucian, motivated to protect her, tries to persuade her to let him accompany her, but Scarlett firmly insists this is something she must do alone, referencing her promise and her need to face her fears.

Lucian, respecting her resolve, asks her to promise to call for help if she senses danger and remains nearby, listening for distant howls and watching for movement among the trees.

----------------------------------------

As Scarlett disappears into the deepening shadows, Lucian’s warning echoes in her mind, sharpening her senses to every rustle and distant cry. The woods, now tinged with uncertainty, seem to close in around her, each step drawing her closer to her grandmother’s cottage—and to an encounter she cannot yet foresee. With her thoughts swirling between caution and curiosity, Scarlett presses on, unaware of the cunning presence waiting just beyond her destination.

# Chapter 3: The Wolf’s Deception at Grandmother’s Cottage

Scarlett arrives at the cottage, her boots squelching in muddy earth as she knocks on the pine door.

Viktor, disguised in Grandmother's nightgown and cap, lies stiffly in the creaky bed, the coarse linen scratching his fur beneath the covers.

Scarlett sets her wicker basket on the oak table and approaches, narrowing her eyes at Viktor's twitching nose poking from beneath the blanket.

She leans closer, inspecting the long, clawed hands gripping the quilt, and asks in a steady voice, 'Grandmother, what big hands you have.

' Viktor, forcing his voice into a quavering imitation, replies, 'All the better to hold you with, my dear,' while curling his claws tighter around the sheet.

Scarlett silently steps back, keeping one hand near the fireplace poker as she scans the room for signs of her real grandmother, determined to uncover the deception.

----------------------------------------

But as Scarlett’s unease grows, a faint noise from the locked closet catches her attention, deepening her suspicion. Unbeknownst to both her and Viktor, footsteps approach the cottage from the shadowed woods—Lucian, drawn by his own urgent purpose, is about to arrive and tip the delicate balance of deception and danger.

# Chapter 4: Scarlett’s Suspicion and Lucian’s Return

Scarlett, determined to help her sick grandmother, braves the muddy path with her basket of herbal remedies.

When Lucian emerges from the shadows, he warns her with urgency that Viktor is dangerously close to the cottage and insists they must act quickly.

Scarlett, resolute, argues for her independence and the importance of her promise to her grandmother, but her words reveal an inner struggle between her need for self-reliance and her understanding of the risks.

Lucian pauses at the edge of the clearing, scanning the shadows, his hand resting instinctively on his weapon as he waits for Scarlett's reaction. "Scarlett, we don't have much time. Viktor was seen circling the cottage—he's closer than ever. We need to decide what to do before he makes his move." ——Lucian

Lucian, more anxious than before, pleads with her repeatedly to accept his help, stressing the unpredictability of the woods and his concern for her safety.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett pushes past Lucian, her brow furrowed with concern as she shoulders aside a low branch, eyes fixed on the winding path ahead. "Lucian, please, I don't have time—my grandmother needs me. I promised I'd bring her this basket, and nothing's going to stop me." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian steps in front of her path, his eyes scanning the dense shadows between the trees. "Scarlett, wait—going alone isn't safe, especially with the woods so thick today." ——Lucian

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett tightens her grip on the basket, her gaze unwavering as she steps forward, determination etched across her face. "I know the woods better than anyone, Lucian, and my grandmother is counting on me—so either help me or let me go." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian steps in front of Scarlett, his gaze earnest as he tries to match her pace, clearly unwilling to let her go alone. "Scarlett, if you're set on this, at least let me walk with you—danger isn't always something you can see." ——Lucian

Their conversation is more emotionally charged and layered than before, with Scarlett acknowledging Lucian's care but emphasizing her need to grow by facing danger herself.

Lucian steps in front of Scarlett, his arm outstretched and eyes narrowed, scanning the rustling shadows at the edge of the path. "Scarlett, wait—don’t go alone. Something’s not right out here tonight. Let me walk with you." ——Lucian

Ultimately, after a tense exchange in which both characters share their vulnerabilities, Scarlett accepts Lucian's companionship—not as a guardian, but as a supportive ally—while making it clear she wants to lead the journey.

Lucian steps closer, concern etched on his face as he tries to meet Scarlett's gaze. "Scarlett, I know you're capable, but the world isn't always kind to those who walk alone; promise me you'll at least let me help when things get rough." ——Lucian

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett folds her arms defiantly, her gaze steady as she meets Lucian's worried eyes. "I appreciate your concern, Lucian, but I can't keep looking over my shoulder—I need to trust myself to face what's out there, even if it means taking risks." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian gently places a reassuring hand on Scarlett's shoulder, his eyes searching hers for understanding. "I understand your need to stand on your own, but my worry isn't about doubting your strength—it's about wanting you safe when uncertainty turns dangerous." ——Lucian

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett lifts her chin, meeting Lucian's gaze with quiet determination, her red cloak catching the faint light as she stands her ground. "Safety matters, Lucian, but so does learning to trust my own judgment—if I never step into the unknown, how will I ever grow?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

They set off together, side-by-side, both aware of the lurking threat but strengthened by their mutual respect and understanding.

----------------------------------------

As the door closed behind them, a tense silence lingered in the air, the echoes of Viktor’s true nature still reverberating through the cottage. Though Scarlett and Lucian had escaped immediate danger, the confrontation had left questions unanswered and emotions raw. With each step away from the cottage, they could not ignore the secrets unearthed and the new uncertainties that shadowed their path. The night was far from over, and as they prepared to face Viktor once more, they sensed that startling revelations awaited them—ones that would challenge everything they thought they knew.

# Chapter 5: The Confrontation and a Surprising Confession

Scarlett stands at the oak table, pouring hot tea with calm yet probing curiosity.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teapot down with a faint clink, her hand trembling ever so slightly as she watches Viktor through narrowed eyes. "The forest's been wild lately. Strangers passing through, wolves howling at dusk. You must've come a long way, Viktor, to arrive in such weather. What brings you so deep into these woods, if you don't mind me asking?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor offers a faint, almost apologetic smile, his eyes flickering from the dancing flames to Scarlett's tense grip on the teapot. "Ah, just seeking shelter from the storm, nothing more—these woods are less forgiving than they once were, wouldn't you agree?" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teacup in front of Viktor, her hand lingering just long enough to watch his reaction, eyes sharp beneath her hood. "Forgiving, perhaps, but never forgetful—these woods remember every footstep, especially those that don't belong." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor gives a thin smile, his eyes lingering on the steam rising from Scarlett's cup, hands folded calmly but tension visible in his shoulders. "And yet, sometimes it's the forgotten paths that offer the warmest welcome—if one knows where to step." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teacup in front of Viktor with a steady hand, though her eyes linger on his muddied boots, searching for answers among the clinging dirt. "Warm welcomes can hide cold intentions, Viktor; I've learned to watch for both." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lifts his cup with steady hands, but his eyes flicker to the door, gauging her reaction. "You have sharp instincts, Scarlett—rest assured, I've no wish to overstep your hospitality." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets Viktor's teacup down with a quiet clink, her eyes never leaving his face as steam curls between them. "Instincts are what keep a girl safe in these woods, especially when the shadows grow longer than the day." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lifts his cup, letting the steam obscure his eyes as he studies Scarlett over the rim, his voice deceptively gentle. "And yet, shadows only grow where the light dares not follow—some secrets prefer the dusk, don't they?" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets Viktor's teacup down with a deliberate clink, her eyes never leaving his as she eases into the chair across from him, hands folded tightly in her lap. "Secrets have a way of slipping out, even in the thickest dusk—especially when guests linger after dark." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor leans forward, his eyes catching the flicker of firelight as he wraps his muddy coat tighter, the faintest hint of a smile curling at the edge of his mouth. "Some guests find nightfall comforting; it conceals what daylight might expose." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett slides Viktor's teacup across the table, her eyes never leaving his face as she keeps her hand curled protectively around her own. "Comfort, or concealment—it's hard to tell the difference when one's never sure if the guest is running from the storm outside, or something darker within." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor wraps his arms tighter around himself, eyes flickering between the fire and Scarlett's steady gaze, his voice soft but edged with something unspoken. "Sometimes the things we run from are closer than we think, and the storm is just an excuse to pause and catch our breath." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teapot down with a soft clink, her hands steady but her gaze sharp and unblinking on Viktor's face. "You speak as if you know the weight of running, Viktor—yet your eyes never quite settle, not even when the fire's warm." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor traces the rim of his chipped mug with a muddy fingertip, gaze flickering between Scarlett’s steady eyes and the flickering shadows on the wall. "Warm fires can lull anyone into lowering their guard, but old habits—well, they tend to outlast the worst weather." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett pours the tea with a steady hand, her gaze unwavering as she slides his cup across the table, the faint aroma of herbs drifting between them. "And what habits might those be, Viktor—the kind that keep you glancing at the door, or the kind that make you flinch at the scent of wolfbane on the windowsill?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor's fingers tighten around his mug, his gaze flickering briefly to the window where dried wolfbane hangs, before settling warily on Scarlett. "Old habits, Scarlett, are the kind that remind a man—or a beast—when he's wandered too close to danger." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teacup in front of Viktor with trembling fingers, never taking her eyes off his mud-splattered boots. "Danger’s just a word until it sits across your table and asks for tea—so tell me, Viktor, are you thirsty, or just waiting for the dark to finish what the storm began?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor wraps his fingers around the cracked mug, his gaze lingering on the shadows that pool beneath the table. "A sip of tea can steady shaking hands, Scarlett, but some thirsts only grow sharper with nightfall." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett sets the teacup down in front of Viktor with a careful, measured motion, her eyes never leaving his face as the wind rattles the shutters. "Then I hope you're not too parched, Viktor—there's comfort in tea, but little relief for a hunger that waits in the shadows." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor, cloaked in mud and mystery, trades tense, layered words with her, both hinting at hidden motives and past traumas.

Lucian slams the door behind him, breath ragged, eyes darting to every shadow as he advances into the dimly lit room. "No time to waste—if anyone's here, show yourself! Or else, this axe finds its mark." ——Lucian

Their conversation grows more intimate and revealing than before, with Scarlett displaying sharper suspicion and a demand for truth, while Viktor admits to being cursed and haunted by a monstrous side he cannot always control.

Lucian bursts in, protective and wary, and keeps his axe at the ready, though his aggression is focused on ensuring proof rather than outright hostility.

Scarlett presents a family portrait, noticing Viktor's deep recognition and prompting a confession: Viktor has protected her family for generations due to a debt owed after her grandmother spared him, intertwining their bloodline with his fate.

Lucian steps in front of Scarlett, his arm stretched protectively across her path, eyes scanning the shadowed doorway ahead. "Scarlett, wait—let me go first. We don't know what's waiting for us in there." ——Lucian

The dialogue reveals that Scarlett is not just an outsider to the Wolf's story, but part of it herself;

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor sits at the edge of a battered chair, hands clenched so tightly his knuckles turn white, eyes lowered and voice trembling with conviction. "You want the truth? Fine. There’s a darkness in me—old as the blood in my veins. It comes in the night, when the moon is high, and it takes everything I am. I become… something else. Something I can’t control. People call it a curse. They’re right. But I’m not here to tear down those who wronged me. I’m here because every life I’ve wrecked weighs on me like chains. I’m not hunting vengeance—not anymore. I want to be free, to be forgiven, even if that means facing the monster in myself. I’m tired of running from it." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Viktor exposes the wolf's mark within her lineage, making the curse and its resolution a family legacy.

Lucian lowers his axe slightly, but his grip remains firm and his stance tense, prepared to react at a moment's notice. "I don't lower my guard for empty words. If you want me to believe you, show me proof—something real. Until then, my axe stays close. I've seen too many betrayals to trust so easily." ——Lucian

Scarlett bravely accepts the truth and promises to help Viktor break the curse, while Lucian agrees to a fragile truce, standing guard as night falls.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett holds out the faded portrait, her voice steady but her hands trembling slightly as she faces Viktor, searching his eyes for answers. "Viktor, look at this portrait. It's been on our mantle for years, but only now did I notice the way you reacted to it. You recognized these faces, didn't you? This isn't just any family portrait—it's important. Please, Viktor, tell me what you know. How are you connected to them?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor steps closer, his gaze lingering on the portrait, fingers tracing the edge of the faded frame as he struggles with the memories surfacing. "Scarlett, the truth is more tangled than you realize—your grandmother once saved me, and every face in that portrait holds a debt or a secret owed to the Wolf." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer, holding the portrait tightly, her voice steady but urgent as she fixes Viktor with a determined gaze. "Then you owe me the truth, Viktor—no more riddles; start with my grandmother, and tell me what happened between you and my family." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor's gaze lingers on the portrait, his claws resting lightly on the frame as if recalling old memories. "Your grandmother spared my life in the forest when I was hunted, and in return, I became the silent guardian of your bloodline, watching over each face in that portrait from the shadows." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer to Viktor, her grip tightening on the portrait, her eyes searching his face for honesty. "If you've watched over us all these years, then you must know things about my family's past that no one else could—please, Viktor, I need you to tell me everything, starting with why my grandmother trusted you." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor steps closer to the portrait, his gaze lingering on Scarlett’s grandmother as his voice grows softer with old regret. "She trusted me because she saw the sorrow behind my hunger, and in her mercy, she offered me forgiveness when the world would offer only fear." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer, holding the portrait between them, her gaze searching Viktor's face for any sign of hesitation or hidden truths. "If my grandmother saw something worth saving in you, Viktor, then I have to understand what bound you to us—tell me about the promises made that night, and what debts still linger between you and my family." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor gently places a clawed hand over the faded portrait, his eyes meeting Scarlett's with solemn intensity. "The promise was simple yet binding—protection for your family, in exchange for secrecy and trust; but each generation added its own price, and now, Scarlett, the final debt is yours to claim." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer, holding the portrait between them, her eyes searching Viktor's face for answers. "If the final debt is mine, Viktor, then I must know exactly what it is—no more shadows, tell me what my family has asked of you, and what I am meant to do now." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor steps closer to the portrait, gently tracing a claw over the faded faces, his eyes meeting Scarlett’s with solemn intensity. "Scarlett, the debt is not just protection—it's the truth itself; your family asked me to guard the secret of our bond until you were ready to face what lies hidden in your lineage." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett holds the portrait tightly, her gaze unwavering as she steps closer to Viktor, determination in her voice and eyes. "Then I'm ready, Viktor—show me what my family hid, and let me decide what to do with the truth." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor steps beside Scarlett, gently guiding her hand to the faded corner of the portrait where a subtle wolf sigil is hidden among the painted shadows. "Very well, Scarlett—look closer at the portrait, at the eyes you thought belonged only to your kin, and you will see the wolf's mark woven through your bloodline, for you are not just their legacy, but mine as well." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

The scene ends with the trio united by revelation: the fate of the family and Viktor's redemption are now inextricably linked, and Scarlett steps into her role as the heir to the secret, determined to face what lies ahead.

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor sits heavily on the battered couch, hands trembling as he exposes the jagged scars beneath his shirt. The flickering lamplight throws shadows across his haunted face, and he meets Scarlett's eyes with a raw vulnerability. Lucian, tense by the window, tightens his grip on his weapon, his posture broadcasting suspicion as he scans the encroaching darkness outside. "I never thought I'd speak of this again. but if we're to survive what's coming, you should know the truth. Years ago, before the curse marked me as The Wolf, I was betrayed by those I trusted most. They hunted me, forced me into darkness—turned me into the very monster they feared. Every scar you see is a debt I owe to their hatred. I don't expect forgiveness, Scarlett, nor trust from Lucian. But I need your help if I'm to end what began that night." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer to Viktor, her voice trembling with conviction as she glances at Lucian, silently pleading for his understanding. "Scarlett: You deserve more than what they did to you, Viktor—no one should be hunted for what they cannot control; I'll help you break this curse, even if it means risking more than I ever have before." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Lucian stands by the rain-streaked window, crossbow in hand, his eyes never leaving Viktor as twilight deepens outside. "Lucian: I'll watch your back tonight, Viktor, but don't mistake this truce for trust—one wrong move, and I'll end it myself." ——Lucian

----------------------------------------

As the storm raged on outside, a fragile silence settled among the trio, each of them measuring the weight of promises and threats that now bound their fates together. With uncertainty swirling in the dimly lit room, Scarlett realized the next move belonged to her alone. The choices she made tonight would not only determine Viktor’s fate, but would also test the limits of her own courage and compassion. As dawn threatened the horizon, Scarlett quietly turned toward the ancient tome resting on the table, knowing that the path to breaking the curse—and finding her own truth—was about to begin.

# Chapter 6: Scarlett’s Choice and the Spell’s Breaking

Scarlett stands defiantly beside her grandmother's bed, clutching her red cloak and placing herself squarely between Viktor and her ailing grandmother as Viktor, still in wolf form, enters the cottage.

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps protectively in front of the bed, clutching her red cloak tighter. Her eyes are wide with fear but unwavering as she faces Viktor, her body tense and ready to defend her grandmother at any cost. "Stay away from her, Viktor! If you lay a single paw on my grandmother, you'll have to go through me first." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his teeth in a chilling grin, stalking a step closer, his yellow eyes fixed hungrily on Scarlett and her grandmother. "Oh, such brave words for someone trembling in their little red cloak—do you really think you can stop me, Scarlett?" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

GrandmotherScarlett steps between Viktor and the bed, her hands shaking but her eyes fierce, while her grandmother reaches out a trembling hand to touch Scarlett's arm in silent support. "Scarlett: I won't let you hurt her—she's all I have left!" ——Grandmother

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his teeth in a wicked grin, stepping closer as his shadow looms over the bed. "Viktor: Your loyalty is touching, child, but I hunger—and no thread or threat will keep me from my meal." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer to the bed, planting herself between Viktor and her grandmother, her fists clenched tight around the edge of her cloak. "Scarlett: Then you'll have to face me, Viktor, because I won't move from this spot." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his fangs in a wicked grin, circling slowly as Scarlett stands firm between him and the bed, her grandmother clutching the quilt with trembling hands. "Viktor (The Wolf): Brave, but foolish—do you really think your love is sharper than my teeth?" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Grandmother reaches a trembling hand toward Scarlett, her voice wavering as Viktor's eyes glint hungrily in the dim light. "Grandmother: Scarlett, darling, step back—don't risk yourself for me; perhaps we can reason with him." ——Grandmother

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett spreads her arms in front of the bed, her voice shaking but her eyes blazing with defiance as Viktor's shadow looms larger across the moonlit floor. "I won't leave you, Grandma—if he wants you, he'll have to go through both of us." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his fangs, circling the bed while Scarlett tightens her grip on her cloak, her grandmother reaching for her hand in silent reassurance. "Viktor (The Wolf): How noble—two trembling hearts against one ravenous wolf; but love does not dull my hunger." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps in front of her grandmother, fists clenched around her cloak, voice shaking but resolute as she stares down the wolf, her body blocking the bed. "You may be hungry, Viktor, but I’d rather be swallowed whole than let you touch her!" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his fangs, muscles coiling as he steps closer, eyes glinting with cruel anticipation. "Viktor (The Wolf): So be it, little lamb—your courage will make the feast all the sweeter." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett tightens her grip on her cloak and steps protectively in front of her grandmother, her eyes blazing despite the quiver in her voice. "Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood): Then come closer, Viktor—I dare you." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his fangs and lowers his head, muscles coiling as he inches closer, the floorboards groaning beneath his weight while Scarlett tightens her grip on her cloak, refusing to flinch, and the grandmother clutches the bedsheet, eyes wide with terror. "Viktor (The Wolf): As you wish, Scarlett—just remember, once I cross this threshold, there's no turning back for any of us." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett spreads her arms protectively in front of her grandmother, her voice shaking but fearless as Viktor's yellow eyes lock with hers, the air crackling with tension. "Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood): Then cross it, Viktor—because I’d rather face you head-on than cower while you threaten the only family I have left." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor bares his fangs and steps forward, his shadow looming over Scarlett and her trembling grandmother as the tension in the room thickens. "Viktor (The Wolf): Such devotion—let's see if your heart is as unbreakable as your spirit." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps in front of her grandmother, chin lifted in defiance, her hands trembling but her gaze locked fiercely on Viktor as he takes another deliberate step forward, eyes gleaming with predatory intent. "Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood): My heart may break, but it will never yield to a monster like you." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lowers his head, lips curling back to reveal glistening fangs as he begins a slow, deliberate advance toward the bed, his yellow eyes locked on Scarlett and her trembling but determined stance. "Viktor (The Wolf): Then prepare yourself, Scarlett, for a monster does not ask permission before he devours." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett squares her shoulders, planting herself protectively in front of her grandmother as her trembling hands clench the edge of her red cloak, her eyes blazing with defiant resolve despite the fear flickering within them. "If you want to see what a 'little lamb' can do when cornered, Viktor, then come any closer and find out." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lowers his head, lips curling back to reveal gleaming fangs as he advances, muscles coiled and eyes fixed hungrily on both Scarlett and her trembling grandmother. "Viktor (The Wolf): Very well, Scarlett—let’s see if your bite matches your bark." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett spreads her arms protectively in front of her grandmother, her voice shaking but her eyes blazing with defiance as she faces the advancing wolf. "You’ll find my teeth are sharper than you think, Viktor—take another step, and I swear you’ll regret it." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lowers his head, lips curling back to reveal gleaming fangs, as he prowls closer, eyes locked on Scarlett and her trembling but defiant stance beside her grandmother’s bed. "Viktor (The Wolf): Then let the hunt begin, little red—may your courage not be the last thing you taste." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

The air is thick with tension as Viktor circles, his hunger and predatory instincts evident in his words and demeanor.

Scarlett refuses to yield, declaring that Viktor will have to go through her first if he wishes to harm her grandmother, while her grandmother pleads for reason and tries to diffuse the confrontation.

The standoff intensifies, with Viktor taunting Scarlett's courage and threatening both of them, but Scarlett's resolve does not waver.

As Viktor advances, the emotional bravery and fierce love displayed by Scarlett and her grandmother begin to affect him;

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor lowers his head further, his ears flat against his skull, and nudges the wildflower closer with his nose, refusing to meet Scarlett's or Grandmother's eyes. "I. I found this outside. It reminded me of you, Scarlett. I know my presence brings fear, but I wish. I wish things could be different. I didn't mean for any harm. I just wanted to understand what kindness feels like." ——Viktor (The Wolf)

his tone softens, and he confesses that he never truly wanted harm, only to understand kindness.

Overcome, Viktor produces a wildflower and offers it to Scarlett as a gesture of peace.

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor staggers back from the fire, his fur shimmering and rippling as if touched by unseen hands. His voice trembles between fear and fragile hope, eyes wide as he glances between Scarlett and Grandmother, searching for answers or comfort. The room grows colder, heavy with dread and anticipation. "What. what's happening to me? The warmth—it's changing. I can feel it in my bones. Scarlett, Grandmother—look at my fur!" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer, eyes wide with a mixture of shock and guarded hope, her hand instinctively reaching for her basket. "Scarlett: Viktor, your fur—it's shimmering, almost fading; is the spell breaking?" ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother leans forward, her eyes wide with both wonder and dread, clutching her shawl as the firelight flickers across Viktor's shifting form. "Child, that shimmer. it's the old magic losing its grip—hold tight to your heart, Viktor, for what comes next may shape your soul forever." ——Grandmother

Viktor (The Wolf)Viktor's voice trembles as shimmering patches ripple across his pelt, his eyes darting between Scarlett and Grandmother, searching for reassurance in their faces. "Scarlett, if this is the end of the curse—will you trust who I become, or fear what I once was?" ——Viktor (The Wolf)

Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)Scarlett steps closer, eyes wide with both caution and hope, her hand hovering uncertainly between reaching out to Viktor and holding back. "Scarlett: Viktor, I want to trust you—but I need to see the truth of who you are, not just the shadow the spell cast." ——Scarlett (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother reaches out, her hand trembling with both fear and hope, eyes locked on the shifting glow of Viktor’s fur. "Whatever form you take, Viktor, remember: the choices of your heart will echo louder than any spell ever could." ——Grandmother

As the flower is accepted and placed in water, Viktor's fur begins to shimmer, signaling the breaking of his curse and marking a pivotal moment in his transformation.

The chapter closes with Scarlett, still wary but willing to believe in Viktor's change, and her grandmother imparting wisdom about the power of one's choices over any spell.

As dawn crept softly through the cottage window, Scarlett, her grandmother, and Viktor—no longer just wolf or foe, but something new—stood together amidst the fading shadows, the promise of forgiveness and transformation settling gently over them like morning light, and with it, the story found its peace.
