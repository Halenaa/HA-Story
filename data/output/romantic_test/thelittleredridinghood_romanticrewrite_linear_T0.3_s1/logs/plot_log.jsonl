Her mother, frowning with concern, places a sealed letter atop the parcel and slides it toward Scarlett with a gentle but firm push. 'Take this to your grandmother, but do not stray from the path,' she instructs, her voice low and urgent. Scarlett nods, securing the package in her basket, then stands and pulls her cloak tighter against the morning chill. She glances out the window toward the shadowy edge of the woods, curiosity flickering in her eyes. Her mother grips her arm briefly, squeezing reassurance into her hand before letting her go. Scarlett steps outside, her boots crunching on frost-laced grass, and sets off toward the forest’s looming, mist-shrouded trees, determined to reach her grandmother swiftly and prove her responsibility."}}

Scarlett straightens, declaring her intent to reach her grandmother’s cottage and refusing to turn back. Lucian warns her of fresh wolf tracks nearby, kneeling to point out claw marks in the mud.

She leans closer, inspecting the long, clawed hands gripping the quilt, and asks in a steady voice, 'Grandmother, what big hands you have.' Viktor, forcing his voice into a quavering imitation, replies, 'All the better to hold you with, my dear,' while curling his claws tighter around the sheet. Scarlett silently steps back, keeping one hand near the fireplace poker as she scans the room for signs of her real grandmother, determined to uncover the deception."}}

Scarlett steps between Viktor and her grandmother, her voice steady: 'I won't let you harm her. If you want to break your curse, you must prove you can choose compassion.'
