Lucian bursts in, protective and wary, and keeps his axe at the ready, though his aggression is focused on ensuring proof rather than outright hostility. Scarlett presents a family portrait, noticing Viktor's deep recognition and prompting a confession: Viktor has protected her family for generations due to a debt owed after her grandmother spared him, intertwining their bloodline with his fate. The dialogue reveals that Scarlett is not just an outsider to the Wolf's story, but part of it herself; Viktor exposes the wolf's mark within her lineage, making the curse and its resolution a family legacy.

The standoff intensifies, with Viktor taunting Scarlett's courage and threatening both of them, but Scarlett's resolve does not waver. As Viktor advances, the emotional bravery and fierce love displayed by Scarlett and her grandmother begin to affect him; his tone softens, and he confesses that he never truly wanted harm, only to understand kindness.
