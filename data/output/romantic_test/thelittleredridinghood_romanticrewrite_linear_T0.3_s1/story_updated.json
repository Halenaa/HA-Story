Her mother, with a mix of concern and gentle encouragement, places a sealed letter atop the parcel and slides it toward Scarlett. 'Take this to your grandmother, but do not stray from the path,' she urges, her voice both loving and serious. Scarlett, clearly curious about the mysterious woods and their secrets, lets her curiosity show as she gazes out the window toward the shadowy trees. She wonders aloud about what lies within the forest and considers how different it looks at dusk, expressing a longing to discover its mysteries. Her mother, both cautious and supportive, reminds Scarlett to be careful and reassures her that it’s okay to feel brave while still being careful. Scarlett promises to be careful and to come straight back after visiting her grandmother, determined to prove her responsibility while also satisfying her curiosity. She steels herself, reminding herself of her grandmother’s need and her own resolve, then sets off toward the misty woods, her curiosity and sense of duty guiding her steps.",

Lucian, his axe slung over his shoulder, steps from behind a birch tree, barring her way with a firm but gentle stance. He scans the woods, eyes alert, and asks in a low voice why she is alone so deep in the forest. Scarlett straightens, declaring her intent to reach her grandmother’s cottage and refusing to turn back. Lucian warns her of fresh wolf tracks nearby, kneeling to point out claw marks in the mud. Scarlett hesitates, then insists she must continue, glancing down at the tracks before stepping past Lucian. Lucian, motivated to protect her, tries to persuade her to let him accompany her, but Scarlett firmly insists this is something she must do alone, referencing her promise and her need to face her fears. Lucian, respecting her resolve, asks her to promise to call for help if she senses danger and remains nearby, listening for distant howls and watching for movement among the trees.",

Scarlett sets her wicker basket on the oak table and approaches, narrowing her eyes at Viktor's twitching nose poking from beneath the blanket. She leans closer, inspecting the long, clawed hands gripping the quilt, and asks in a steady voice, 'Grandmother, what big hands you have.' Viktor, forcing his voice into a quavering imitation, replies, 'All the better to hold you with, my dear,' while curling his claws tighter around the sheet.

When Lucian emerges from the shadows, he warns her with urgency that Viktor is dangerously close to the cottage and insists they must act quickly. Scarlett, resolute, argues for her independence and the importance of her promise to her grandmother, but her words reveal an inner struggle between her need for self-reliance and her understanding of the risks. Lucian, more anxious than before, pleads with her repeatedly to accept his help, stressing the unpredictability of the woods and his concern for her safety. Their conversation is more emotionally charged and layered than before, with Scarlett acknowledging Lucian's care but emphasizing her need to grow by facing danger herself. Ultimately, after a tense exchange in which both characters share their vulnerabilities, Scarlett accepts Lucian's companionship—not as a guardian, but as a supportive ally—while making it clear she wants to lead the journey.

Their conversation grows more intimate and revealing than before, with Scarlett displaying sharper suspicion and a demand for truth, while Viktor admits to being cursed and haunted by a monstrous side he cannot always control. Lucian bursts in, protective and wary, and keeps his axe at the ready, though his aggression is focused on ensuring proof rather than outright hostility. Scarlett presents a family portrait, noticing Viktor's deep recognition and prompting a confession: Viktor has protected her family for generations due to a debt owed after her grandmother spared him, intertwining their bloodline with his fate. The dialogue reveals that Scarlett is not just an outsider to the Wolf's story, but part of it herself; Viktor exposes the wolf's mark within her lineage, making the curse and its resolution a family legacy. Scarlett bravely accepts the truth and promises to help Viktor break the curse, while Lucian agrees to a fragile truce, standing guard as night falls.
