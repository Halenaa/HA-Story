She pauses to adjust her red cloak, brushing a twig from her hem. Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from a thicket, his fur spiked with dew, tail twitching. Rather than circling Red from a distance, The Wolf greets her in a more companionable manner: 'Good morning, Red. Out bright and early, I see. The woods seem quieter with you passing through. Mind if I walk with you a while?' Red, more open than before, allows him to walk beside her as long as he keeps to the path. Their banter is layered with caution and curiosity, both testing boundaries but never quite crossing them. The Wolf subtly suggests alternative routes, hinting at the dangers and the allure of the unknown, but Red remains steadfast, citing her Grandmother's advice and her own growing confidence in the woods. The Wolf tries to persuade her with charm and warnings about the shifting dangers of the forest, but Red insists on following the path she knows, demonstrating trust in her Grandmother's wisdom and her own judgment. Their conversation reflects a deeper mutual respect and wariness, with Red showing more agency and the Wolf more vulnerability. In the end, Red thanks The Wolf for his concern but chooses to stay on her route, and The Wolf walks with her for a time, trying to earn her trust step by step, before letting her continue on her own.

As suspicions mount, Red grows bolder, challenging the Wolf about his twitching tail, sharp teeth, and wild eyes. The Wolf tries to bluff, but Red confronts him, brandishing a candlestick in self-defense.

The Wolf confesses his loneliness, longing for connection, and hopes that Red might see past his fearsome exterior.
