She glances at the pale sky, gestures toward the forest’s edge, and instructs Red to deliver the goods to Grandmother before the sun climbs higher. Red, adjusting her red cloak around her shoulders, listens intently, then asks if she may take the northern path. Her mother, brow furrowed, insists Red avoid the shaded trails and warns her to speak to no strangers, gripping Red’s arm to emphasize her point. The morning bustle of villagers and the distant cry of a rooster fill the air as Red accepts the basket, promises to be careful, and sets off toward the forest, the weight of her mother’s instructions guiding her first steps."}}

She pauses to adjust her red cloak, brushing a twig from her hem. Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from a thicket, his fur spiked with dew, tail twitching. He circles Red at a respectful distance, lowering his head in greeting. 'Good morning, Red. The woods seem hungrier than usual today,' he says, his voice both teasing and edged with longing. Red grips her basket tighter, watching his quick movements. 'I'm just passing through,' she replies, keeping her tone steady. The Wolf paces parallel to her, sniffing the air. 'I could show you a quicker way—safer, too,' he offers, flicking his ears toward a shadowed trail. Red hesitates, glancing at the new path. After a moment, she decides to stay on her route, shaking her head. 'Thank you, but Grandmother trusts this path.' The Wolf's ears flatten for a moment before he steps back, letting Red pass. He lingers by the path, watching her disappear between the trees, his tail flicking with unspoken intent. The encounter leaves Red more alert, and The Wolf determined to prove his sincerity."}}

Red narrows her eyes, quickening her pace and retorting, 'I know these woods better than you think.' Branches snap as the Wolf leaps over a fallen log, his motivation clear: to reach Grandmother’s home before Red and prove his helpfulness. Red, determined to care for her grandmother and wary of the Wolf’s intentions, presses onward. The pair’s footsteps echo over the damp earth, each vying to arrive first, their rivalry propelling them deeper into the shadowed forest."}}

She knocks on the warped wooden door three times, the sound echoing through the quiet glade. The Wolf, disguised in Grandmother's shawl, sits rigidly beside the hearth, occasionally sniffing the air to detect Red's approach. As Red enters, she places the basket on the rough table and begins to unpack jars of soup and herbs, her fingers brushing against the coarse linen. Noticing the Wolf's gloved paws and unconvincing voice, Red squints and moves closer, questioning him about Grandmother's favorite tea, testing his knowledge. The Wolf, motivated to maintain his ruse, fumbles to answer, but his tail slips from under the shawl. Red reaches for the shawl and pulls it away, exposing the Wolf's snout. The Wolf leaps back, knocking over the iron kettle, which clangs loudly against the stone floor. Red grabs a heavy candlestick, preparing to defend herself, but the Wolf raises his paws, pleading for her to listen. The confrontation forces Red to make a choice: she demands the truth, and the Wolf, desperate to prove his sincerity, confesses his affection and longing for connection, promising he means no harm."}}

Grandmother steps into his path and brandishes the poker, blocking his advance. 'You think you can just slink in and fool us all?' she growls, her eyes sharp. The Wolf flattens his ears and circles the table, tail low but eyes fixed on her, replying in a low rumble, 'I came for Red, not harm. Let me speak to her.' Grandmother jabs the poker at his chest, forcing him back towards the door, saying, 'You'll speak to no one unless you prove your intentions.' The Wolf, driven by his longing for Red, sinks to his haunches and flattens his paws, showing submission but refusing to leave, insisting, 'I only want a chance.'

He circles slowly, sniffing the air, then stops two paces away. 'You always smell of wildflowers and bread, Red,' he says, voice rumbling low. Red grips her basket tighter, glancing back at the cottage. 'Why do you keep following me?' she asks, keeping her posture stiff. The Wolf sits on his haunches, tail flicking. 'Because I wish to show you I can be trusted,' he replies, eyes never leaving hers. Red kneels, setting her basket between them, and pulls out a small loaf. She breaks it in half, offering a piece to The Wolf. He hesitates, then takes it gently in his jaws. The two sit in silence, birds chirping overhead, as Red considers her next move. Her objective: to test The Wolf's sincerity. Outcome: The Wolf accepts her offering without aggression, signaling a fragile trust beginning to form."}}

Red examines the berries, her fingers brushing his paw, then asks pointedly why he followed her. The Wolf, licking rain from his nose, explains he wishes to prove his intentions. Red considers his words, sets the basket down, and breaks a piece of bread in half, handing a portion to the Wolf. Their exchange is quiet, punctuated by the crunch of twigs and the distant call of a jay. The Wolf promises to protect Red and her grandmother if danger comes. Red nods, her actions showing tentative trust as she accepts his offering. Together, they walk toward the cottage, the Wolf pacing beside her, ears twitching at every sound in the underbrush."}}
