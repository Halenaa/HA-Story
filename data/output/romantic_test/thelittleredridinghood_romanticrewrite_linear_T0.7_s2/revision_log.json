        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shows Red allowing The Wolf to walk beside her for a while, engaging in a more extended, mutual conversation with layered trust and caution. Red is more assertive, referencing her Grandmother's teachings and her own growing confidence. The Wolf is less predatory and more vulnerable, seeking to earn Red's trust. The original plot had The Wolf circling at a distance and making an offer that Red rejects more promptly, while in the dialogue, there is more back-and-forth and mutual testing. The plot has been updated to reflect this more collaborative and nuanced interaction.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue significantly extends and deepens Red's interrogation of the Wolf, with more detailed and persistent questioning than in the original plot. Red does not physically pull away the shawl, but instead verbally unmasks the Wolf through a series of specific challenges, demanding emotional honesty before physical confrontation. The emotional exchange is more prolonged and nuanced, focusing on Red's demand for truth and the Wolf's confession of loneliness and desire for acceptance. The update maintains character logic and natural progression, but reflects a shift from an immediate physical reveal to a verbal and emotional unmasking.",

        "plot_change_note": "There is a minor deviation: in the dialogue, the Wolf momentarily uses a slightly threatening tone ('It would be... unwise to stand in my way'), which is stronger than in the original plot's submissive behavior. However, the Wolf quickly reverts to a vulnerable plea, consistent with his motivation. Grandmother's assertive, skeptical stance is maintained. The update clarifies this brief tension, showing the Wolf's initial insistence before moving to submission, and that Grandmother remains guarded but is affected by his vulnerability.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue is more tense and layered than the original plot description. Red does not offer bread or explicitly test The Wolf's sincerity through an act of sharing, but rather through direct verbal challenge. The Wolf's approach is more vulnerable and emotionally open, and Red remains guarded, not immediately moving toward fragile trust but instead questioning and negotiating. The plot is updated to reflect that trust is built through dialogue rather than a physical offering.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue is more direct and emotionally charged than the original plot, with Red explicitly confronting The Wolf and Grandmother chiming in with her skepticism. The Wolf’s motivation to prove himself and win trust is consistent, but the exchange is less about sharing food and more about negotiating trust and promises, with Grandmother involved earlier. The updated plot removes the bread/berries exchange and instead centers on the verbal negotiation of trust and protection, maintaining character logic and narrative flow.",
