Her mother stands by the doorway, glancing nervously toward the shadowed tree line, and presses a sealed envelope into Red's gloved palm. Red inspects the unfamiliar wax seal, running her thumb over its raised design. Her mother leans in, voice low and brisk: 'Take this straight to your grandmother, no detours.' She tucks a stray hair behind Red's ear and scans the path for movement. Red nods, tucks the letter securely in her basket, and strides down the stone path, her boots crunching on wet leaves. Her mother lingers by the gate, watching Red disappear into the mist, her hand gripping the fence with white knuckles.",

From behind a thick bramble, Wolfe emerges, brushing leaves from his shoulder, and offers a half-bow. He lifts a hand in greeting, his eyes keen and watchful. Red stands, gripping her basket tighter and angles her body away from Wolfe, recalling her mother's warning but also curious about the stranger's reputation. Wolfe, noticing her wariness, picks a sprig of wild mint and extends it, saying, 'The deer eat these when they're nervous. You look like you could use a little calm.' Red eyes the offering, then accepts it, allowing Wolfe to walk beside her as she resumes her journey. As they walk, Wolfe asks pointed questions about her destination and the contents of her basket. Red deflects, saying only that she's visiting her grandmother, while subtly adjusting her grip on the hidden letter inside her cloak. The two circle each other verbally, each alert for signs of trust or deception, with Red quickening her pace whenever Wolfe strays too close to her side. The encounter ends with Wolfe stepping aside at a fork in the path, gesturing with a flourish for Red to pass, but promising, 'I'll see you further down the trail.' Red nods curtly, her focus sharpening on the path ahead, and continues deeper into the woods.",
