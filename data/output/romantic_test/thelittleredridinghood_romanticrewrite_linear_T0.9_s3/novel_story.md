# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Invitation

Red Riding Hood tightens the red cloak around her shoulders as she steps onto the creaking porch, wicker basket in hand.

Her mother stands by the doorway, glancing nervously toward the shadowed tree line, and presses a sealed envelope into Red's gloved palm.

Her mother is especially insistent and anxious, repeating her instructions with heightened urgency: 'Go straight to your grandmother’s house—no stopping, no talking to anyone, and absolutely no wandering off the path.

This is important, do you understand?

Red's MotherShe presses the basket into Red’s hands, her eyes stern and fixed on her daughter’s face, making sure Red grasps the seriousness of her words. "Red, listen to me very carefully. Go straight to your grandmother’s house—no stopping, no talking to anyone, and absolutely no wandering off the path. This is important, do you understand?" ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe clasps Red's shoulders firmly, searching her daughter's eyes for understanding. "Promise me now, Red—no matter what you see or hear, you go directly there and nowhere else." ——Red's Mother

Promise me now, Red—no matter what you see or hear, you go directly there and nowhere else.

' Red inspects the unfamiliar wax seal, running her thumb over its raised design, nods solemnly, and tucks the letter securely in her basket.

She strides down the stone path, her boots crunching on wet leaves.

Her mother lingers by the gate, watching Red disappear into the mist, her hand gripping the fence with white knuckles.

# Chapter 2: An Encounter with the Charming Stranger

Red Riding Hood steps carefully over a tangle of roots, her basket swinging from her arm, eyes scanning the shaded path ahead.

She pauses, kneeling to examine an odd set of footprints pressed into the soft mud, her fingers brushing over the fresh tracks.

From behind a thick bramble, Wolfe emerges, brushing leaves from his shoulder, and offers a half-bow.

He lifts a hand in greeting, his eyes keen and watchful.

Red stands, gripping her basket tighter and angles her body away from Wolfe, recalling her mother's warning but also curious about the stranger's reputation.

Wolfe, noticing her wariness, picks a sprig of wild mint and extends it, saying, 'The deer eat these when they're nervous.

Wolfe gently holds out the sprig of wild mint, his gaze steady and reassuring, inviting the other character to accept the gesture. "You know, when the deer get jumpy, they nibble on these. Helps them settle, or so I've seen. Here—take it. Sometimes a bit of green between your fingers is enough to remind you you're not alone out here." ——Wolfe

You look like you could use a little calm.

Wolfe gently gestures toward a quiet corner, his tone soft and inviting, making space for the other person to join him or open up if they're ready. "Hey, are you alright? You look like the weight of the world’s on your shoulders. Maybe we could sit for a minute—catch our breath. Sometimes it helps just to talk, if you want to." ——Wolfe

' He then gently asks if Red is alright and suggests taking a moment to rest and talk if she wishes, revealing a more openly concerned and supportive side than previously shown.

Red, still cautious, politely declines to share much detail, simply stating that she is visiting her grandmother who is unwell and bringing bread and honey, subtly avoiding mention of the hidden letter.

Wolfe glances at the basket in her hands, his gaze lingering a moment longer than necessary, as if weighing the importance of its contents. "You seem to be in quite a hurry this morning. Where are you off to, if you don't mind my asking?" ——Wolfe

Wolfe continues to ask about her journey in a friendly but persistent manner, but Red deflects, maintaining her focus on her family.

Red Riding HoodRed offers a small, polite smile, but her fingers fidget nervously with the edge of her cloak, her other hand unconsciously pressing the concealed letter closer to her side. "Oh, nothing special, really—just off to see my grandmother. She’s not been feeling well lately, so I thought I’d bring her some bread and honey." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed fidgets with the edge of her cloak, glancing briefly down the path as if eager to move on. "I suppose it’s just one of those days where you want to check in on family, you know?" ——Red Riding Hood

Their conversation reveals a slightly more open rapport, with Wolfe expressing philosophical thoughts about choices and paths, signaling his wish to see her again.

The encounter ends with Wolfe stepping aside at a fork in the path, gesturing with a flourish for Red to pass, and promising, 'I'll see you further down the trail.

Wolfe steps aside with a graceful sweep of his arm, eyes lingering on Red with a sly, unreadable smile, allowing her to pass as the breeze stirs his cloak. "The woods are full of crossroads, Red. Each one offers a new choice—sometimes they echo with footsteps, sometimes with regrets. But remember, every path circles back eventually. I’ll see you further down the trail." ——Wolfe

' Red nods curtly, her focus sharpening on the path ahead, and continues deeper into the woods.

# Chapter 3: A Race to Grandmother's Cottage

Red Riding Hood pushes onward, urgency clear in every step as she speaks aloud her determination to deliver the letter to her grandmother before nightfall, undeterred by the dangers of the forest.

Red Riding Hood presses forward, her boots crunching over tangled roots, eyes darting ahead for any sign of the path's end. "I mustn't slow down—every minute counts! Grandmother needs this letter, and nothing in this forest will stop me from delivering it." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding Hood quickens her pace, glancing anxiously at the darkening canopy overhead as she tucks the letter closer to her heart. "I can hear the distant howl of wolves, but my resolve is stronger than any fear—this message must reach her before nightfall." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding Hood tightens her grip on the letter, scanning the dappled path ahead as she pushes forward with unwavering determination. "If I quicken my pace and trust my instincts, I can outsmart any danger lurking among the shadows." ——Red Riding Hood

Wolfe appears, announcing his presence and warning her of the risks after sunset, his tone more ominous and self-serving than before.

Wolfe stands his ground, posture easy yet deliberate, eyes studying her reaction beneath the brim of his hat. "Evenin', miss. Hate to trouble you, but I reckon folks shouldn't wander these woods alone after sunset. Strange things tend to happen out here." ——Wolfe

Red, clever and perceptive, immediately calls out his presence, refusing to be deceived and demanding reasons for his stealth.

Wolfe offers a shortcut, emphasizing his familiarity with the woods, but his inner thoughts reveal a cunning plan: he intends to reach Grandmother's cottage before Red, hinting at sinister intentions with the line 'supper will be served.

Red Riding HoodRed narrows her eyes, keeping her basket close and her steps light as she circles a dense patch of brambles, never turning her back to the shadows. "I know you're out there. Show yourself—I'm not as easy to fool as you think." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed tightens her grip on her basket, eyes darting between the shadows as she slowly backs toward a thicker patch of trees. "Every snapped twig gives you away, so you'd better have a good reason for following me." ——Red Riding Hood

' Red remains steadfast, relying on her instincts and refusing to trust Wolfe.

Wolfe steps aside, gesturing toward the tangled entrance of the deer trail, pausing just enough to meet her eyes and wait for her answer before moving ahead. "If we cut left here, we'll save at least half an hour. It's tight, but I've walked it before—safer than circling the ridge. You trust me?" ——Wolfe

Both set off on separate paths, Wolfe now explicitly motivated by a competitive, possibly predatory goal, rather than simply impressing Red and her grandmother.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Wolfe Arrives First and Strikes a Deal

Wolfe steps onto the worn stone path and raps twice on the weathered door, glancing at the twisted brambles lining the cottage.

Grandmother, wrapped in a patchwork shawl, opens the door just enough to peer out and assesses Wolfe with a steady gaze.

Wolfe tips his hat and offers to chop firewood in exchange for a few minutes of conversation, his voice low and earnest.

Wolfe tips his hat respectfully, keeping a careful distance as he gestures toward the woodpile with callused hands, his posture open but cautious. "Evening, ma'am. I don't mean to intrude, but I noticed your woodpile running low. If you'll allow me, I'd be glad to lend a hand with the chopping—no charge but for a moment of your time. Sometimes a stranger's ear can lighten a heavy heart." ——Wolfe

Grandmother leans a little on her cane, studying Wolfe's face with a wary but not unkind gaze, gesturing toward the stacked logs by the cottage wall. "Well, kindness is rare as spring rain these days, young man, but I reckon you're welcome if your axe is as honest as your tongue." ——Grandmother

Wolfe sets his axe gently against the porch rail, keeping his hands visible as he meets Grandmother's gaze, respectful but quietly searching. "My word's my bond, ma'am—I'm seeking only a story, not trouble, and maybe a warm place to rest after the work is done." ——Wolfe

Grandmother steps aside from the doorway, watching Wolfe with sharp, appraising eyes as she gestures toward the woodpile. "Stories are the currency of old women and wolves alike, Mr. Wolfe, but you'll find mine come dear—so swing that axe true, and we'll see what trust is worth." ——Grandmother

Grandmother unlocks the door fully, gestures toward the woodpile, and instructs Wolfe to stack logs by the hearth.

Grandmother swings the door wide, points firmly to the woodpile outside, then to the empty space near the fireplace, her tone leaving no room for argument. "Come along now, Wolfe. The door's open. I want those logs from the pile stacked neatly by the hearth before supper. No dawdling." ——Grandmother

Wolfe steps inside, glancing at the woodpile before moving toward it. "Yes, Grandmother, I'll get started right away." ——Wolfe

As Wolfe gathers and splits wood, Grandmother watches, testing his diligence and intent.

Wolfe agrees to her terms, stacking the logs neatly, and Grandmother nods, signaling her willingness to listen to his proposal inside, setting the stage for their bargain.

Wolfe brushes wood dust from his hands, standing respectfully by the door, meeting Grandmother's gaze with calm anticipation. "There. The logs are stacked as you asked, Grandmother. Thank you for your patience—and for giving me the chance to speak. May I come inside now to present my proposal?" ——Wolfe

Grandmother opens the door wider, gesturing for Wolfe to step inside, her expression measured but open to discussion. "You may enter, Wolfe; you've honored your word, and I will honor mine—let us sit by the hearth and hear what you have to offer." ——Grandmother

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red's Arrival and the Deceptive Introduction

Red Riding Hood hurries along the tangled woodland path, fiercely protective of the basket meant for her ailing grandmother.

Wolfe appears, charming as ever, and inquires about her purpose.

Red, anxious about her grandmother's health, urgently explains the importance of her mission—her grandmother needs the food to recover, and any delay could be serious.

Wolfe steps out from the shadow of a lamppost, arms folded, watching the hurried figure approach. "Where are you headed with such purpose?" ——Wolfe

Wolfe attempts to guide her onto a shortcut, but Red, increasingly suspicious, questions his motives and insists on the route she knows.

Red Riding HoodRed keeps her eyes on the wolf, carefully edging past him while tightening her grip on her basket. "I'm going to see my grandmother, and nothing is going to stop me." ——Red Riding Hood

Despite her wariness, she acknowledges Wolfe's efforts to help and expresses gratitude for his concern, though she remains firmly in control of her path.

Red Riding HoodClutches the basket tightly and starts walking briskly down the path toward Grandmother's house, glancing anxiously at the forest ahead. "I must hurry—Grandmother is waiting for this basket of food, and she hasn't been feeling well. It's very important that I get it to her as soon as possible. I can't let anything slow me down!" ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodAdjusts the basket on her arm and quickens her pace, glancing anxiously at the path ahead. "If I don't get this basket to Grandmother quickly, she might not have the strength she needs to feel better." ——Red Riding Hood

Wolfe, seeing her determination and appreciation, continues to follow at a distance, his interest in her mission undiminished but his respect for her wishes growing.

The tone is more urgent and Red is more openly grateful for Wolfe's presence than previously, but she maintains her independence and mission focus.

Red Riding HoodRed lifts her chin, meeting his gaze directly, her basket firm in her hand as she takes a deliberate step forward, refusing to be led. "I said I know the way. You don’t have to keep suggesting shortcuts—or watching me so closely. Is there something you’re not telling me?" ——Red Riding Hood

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Confession and the Choice

Red Riding Hood arrives at Grandmother's cottage and knocks urgently, her anxiety heightened by a sense of imminent danger.

Wolfe appears, more tense and secretive than before, warning Red that there is a traitor within their circle and that they must act swiftly to protect themselves.

The exchange at the door escalates as Red calls for Grandmother with increasing urgency, and Wolfe reveals a second, desperate letter, hinting that its contents are a confession that could upend everything.

Sensing the threat, Grandmother quietly opens the door and joins Red in a united front, wary of Wolfe's intentions.

The trio engage in a tense verbal sparring, each testing the other's resolve and motives.

Wolfe glances around to ensure no one else is listening, his eyes sharp with concern. "Listen carefully—what I’m about to tell you doesn’t leave this room. There’s more at stake here than anyone realizes, and if we don’t move quickly, we’re all in danger." ——Wolfe

Wolfe glances toward the door, ensuring no one is listening, his jaw clenched with concern. "I have reason to believe someone inside our circle is working against us." ——Wolfe

Wolfe admits his hunger—for truth, trust, and perhaps something darker—but Red and Grandmother stand firm, their courage sharpened by fear and their determination to uncover the truth stronger than ever.

The standoff at the threshold becomes more than just about a letter;

it's about loyalty, hidden dangers, and whether Wolfe can be trusted at all as the night closes in around them.

Red Riding HoodRed raps sharply on the door again, her brow furrowed with concern, glancing nervously at the quiet cottage. "Grandmother, are you in there? It's me, Red! Please open up—it's important!" ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed leans closer to the door, her voice trembling with worry as she knocks even harder. "Grandmother, please—I really need to see you right now!" ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed clenches her fist and knocks even harder, her voice trembling with worry. "Grandmother, please, it's urgent—I won't leave until you answer!" ——Red Riding Hood
