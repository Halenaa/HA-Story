Red inspects the unfamiliar wax seal, running her thumb over its raised design. Her mother leans in, voice low and brisk: 'Take this straight to your grandmother, no detours.' She tucks a stray hair behind Red's ear and scans the path for movement. Red nods, tucks the letter securely in her basket, and strides down the stone path, her boots crunching on wet leaves. Her mother lingers by the gate, watching Red disappear into the mist, her hand gripping the fence with white knuckles."}}

She pauses, kneeling to examine an odd set of footprints pressed into the soft mud, her fingers brushing over the fresh tracks. From behind a thick bramble, Wolfe emerges, brushing leaves from his shoulder, and offers a half-bow. He lifts a hand in greeting, his eyes keen and watchful. Red stands, gripping her basket tighter and angles her body away from Wolfe, recalling her mother's warning but also curious about the stranger's reputation. Wolfe, noticing her wariness, picks a sprig of wild mint and extends it, saying, 'The deer eat these when they're nervous. You look like you could use a little calm.' Red eyes the offering, then accepts it, allowing Wolfe to walk beside her as she resumes her journey. As they walk, Wolfe asks pointed questions about her destination and the contents of her basket. Red deflects, saying only that she's visiting her grandmother, while subtly adjusting her grip on the hidden letter inside her cloak. The two circle each other verbally, each alert for signs of trust or deception, with Red quickening her pace whenever Wolfe strays too close to her side. The encounter ends with Wolfe stepping aside at a fork in the path, gesturing with a flourish for Red to pass, but promising, 'I'll see you further down the trail.' Red nods curtly, her focus sharpening on the path ahead, and continues deeper into the woods."}}

Red shakes her head, sidestepping him and scanning the undergrowth for hidden dangers.

Wolfe matches her stride, brushing aside a low-hanging branch to clear her path but subtly guiding her feet toward a detour. Red notices his maneuver and pauses, narrowing her eyes, then insists, 'I know the way. Thank you.' Wolfe grins, feigning innocence, but his gaze lingers on the basket. Red tightens her grip and resumes along the original trail, her boots squelching over a patch of mud, while Wolfe, persistent, follows at a respectful distance, continuing to probe her intentions. The objective is for Red to safely reach her grandmother's cottage while evading Wolfe's attempts to steer her elsewhere; the result is that Red maintains control of her route, though Wolfe makes his interest in her mission clear."}}

Let me prove myself.' Red considers him, then raps sharply on the door again. As the door creaks open, Grandmother's silhouette appears in the warm lamplight, and Red steps between Wolfe and the threshold, blocking his entry and stating, 'Not until he tells us the truth.' Wolfe hesitates, then reaches into his coat to reveal a second, crumpled letter. 'I have a confession. This was meant for your grandmother, too.' The standoff leaves the door half-open, with the scent of woodsmoke drifting out as both Red and Grandmother wait for Wolfe's next move."}}
