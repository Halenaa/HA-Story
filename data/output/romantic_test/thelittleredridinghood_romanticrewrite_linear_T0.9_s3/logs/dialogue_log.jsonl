This is important, do you understand? Promise me now, Red—no matter what you see or hear, you go directly there and nowhere else.' Red inspects the unfamiliar wax seal, running her thumb over its raised design, nods solemnly, and tucks the letter securely in her basket.

She pauses, kneeling to examine an odd set of footprints pressed into the soft mud, her fingers brushing over the fresh tracks. From behind a thick bramble, Wolfe emerges, brushing leaves from his shoulder, and offers a half-bow. He lifts a hand in greeting, his eyes keen and watchful. Red stands, gripping her basket tighter and angles her body away from Wolfe, recalling her mother's warning but also curious about the stranger's reputation. Wolfe, noticing her wariness, picks a sprig of wild mint and extends it, saying, 'The deer eat these when they're nervous. You look like you could use a little calm.' He then gently asks if Red is alright and suggests taking a moment to rest and talk if she wishes, revealing a more openly concerned and supportive side than previously shown. Red, still cautious, politely declines to share much detail, simply stating that she is visiting her grandmother who is unwell and bringing bread and honey, subtly avoiding mention of the hidden letter. Wolfe continues to ask about her journey in a friendly but persistent manner, but Red deflects, maintaining her focus on her family. Their conversation reveals a slightly more open rapport, with Wolfe expressing philosophical thoughts about choices and paths, signaling his wish to see her again. The encounter ends with Wolfe stepping aside at a fork in the path, gesturing with a flourish for Red to pass, and promising, 'I'll see you further down the trail.' Red nods curtly, her focus sharpening on the path ahead, and continues deeper into the woods."}, "output": {"dialogue": {}}}
