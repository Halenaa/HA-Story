Her mother stands by the doorway, glancing nervously toward the shadowed tree line, and presses a sealed envelope into Red's gloved palm. Her mother is especially insistent and anxious, repeating her instructions with heightened urgency: 'Go straight to your grandmother’s house—no stopping, no talking to anyone, and absolutely no wandering off the path. This is important, do you understand? Promise me now, Red—no matter what you see or hear, you go directly there and nowhere else.' Red inspects the unfamiliar wax seal, running her thumb over its raised design, nods solemnly, and tucks the letter securely in her basket. She strides down the stone path, her boots crunching on wet leaves. Her mother lingers by the gate, watching Red disappear into the mist, her hand gripping the fence with white knuckles.",

She pauses, kneeling to examine an odd set of footprints pressed into the soft mud, her fingers brushing over the fresh tracks. From behind a thick bramble, Wolfe emerges, brushing leaves from his shoulder, and offers a half-bow. He lifts a hand in greeting, his eyes keen and watchful. Red stands, gripping her basket tighter and angles her body away from Wolfe, recalling her mother's warning but also curious about the stranger's reputation. Wolfe, noticing her wariness, picks a sprig of wild mint and extends it, saying, 'The deer eat these when they're nervous. You look like you could use a little calm.' He then gently asks if Red is alright and suggests taking a moment to rest and talk if she wishes, revealing a more openly concerned and supportive side than previously shown. Red, still cautious, politely declines to share much detail, simply stating that she is visiting her grandmother who is unwell and bringing bread and honey, subtly avoiding mention of the hidden letter. Wolfe continues to ask about her journey in a friendly but persistent manner, but Red deflects, maintaining her focus on her family. Their conversation reveals a slightly more open rapport, with Wolfe expressing philosophical thoughts about choices and paths, signaling his wish to see her again. The encounter ends with Wolfe stepping aside at a fork in the path, gesturing with a flourish for Red to pass, and promising, 'I'll see you further down the trail.' Red nods curtly, her focus sharpening on the path ahead, and continues deeper into the woods.",

The updated plot incorporates Wolfe's supportive behavior and Red's more personal reply, preserving character logic and natural progression."

Red, clever and perceptive, immediately calls out his presence, refusing to be deceived and demanding reasons for his stealth. Wolfe offers a shortcut, emphasizing his familiarity with the woods, but his inner thoughts reveal a cunning plan: he intends to reach Grandmother's cottage before Red, hinting at sinister intentions with the line 'supper will be served.' Red remains steadfast, relying on her instincts and refusing to trust Wolfe. Both set off on separate paths, Wolfe now explicitly motivated by a competitive, possibly predatory goal, rather than simply impressing Red and her grandmother.",
