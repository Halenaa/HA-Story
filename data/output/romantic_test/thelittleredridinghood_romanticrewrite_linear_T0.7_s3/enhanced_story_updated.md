# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Letter

Red carefully arranges jars of elderberry jam and a folded blanket into the basket, glancing at the sealed envelope her mother places on top.

Mother tightens Red's cloak strings, brushing off crumbs from her daughter's shoulder, and hands her the basket with a firm grip.

She warns Red about the dense fog in the forest and the recent sightings of a large animal near the old birch trail.

Mother stands by the doorway, her hand gently resting on Red’s shoulder, her eyes filled with concern as she tries to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. "Red, before you head out, I need you to listen carefully. The fog in the forest is thick this morning—so thick you can barely see a few steps ahead. And just yesterday, Mr. Fletcher spotted a large animal near the old birch trail. I’m worried it could be dangerous. Promise me you’ll stay on the main path and keep your eyes open." ——Mother

Red nods solemnly, clutching the basket a little tighter as she glances toward the shadowy trees beyond the cottage. "I promise, Mother—I’ll be careful and stick to the main path, but I have to bring the basket to Grandma." ——Red

Red nods, her fingers gripping the basket handle, and promises to avoid the shortcut by the creek.

Red nods earnestly, tightening her grip on the basket handle as she glances toward the forest, her voice steady but her eyes betraying a hint of longing for the forbidden path. "I promise, Mother, I'll take the main path through the woods—no shortcuts by the creek, just like you said." ——Red

Mother lays a gentle hand on Red's shoulder, her eyes soft but serious. "Good girl, Red—it's just that the woods are safer when you stay on the path, and you know how quickly trouble can find you near that creek." ——Mother

Mother watches Red step onto the porch, closing the door behind her, determined to ensure Red understands the importance of delivering the basket and letter safely to Grandmother.

----------------------------------------

Red’s footsteps echoed softly on the familiar wooden boards as she left the safety of home behind, the weight of her mother’s words lingering in her mind. The forest loomed ahead, its early morning hush broken only by the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant calls of birds. With each step down the winding trail, Red found herself scanning the trees for any sign of movement, her thoughts drifting between duty and the hope of a friendly face. As the path curved beneath the sheltering branches, Red soon approached a familiar fork in the road—where choices and chance so often shaped the journey ahead.

# Chapter 2: Encounter at the Fork

Red pauses at the fork, her boots crunching on damp leaves as she consults the folded map her mother gave her.

She adjusts the woven basket on her arm, peering down each path in search of the quickest route to her grandmother's cottage.

As she hesitates, Wolf—disguised as a lanky, dark-haired traveler in a tattered cloak—emerges from the shadows, sniffing the air and eyeing the basket.

He steps into Red's path, brushing dirt from his sleeve with calculated nonchalance, and greets her with a toothy grin.

'Lost, little one?

' he asks, voice smooth and curious, his gaze flicking between her face and the basket.

Red grips the handle tighter, recalling her mother's warning, but forces a polite smile.

'I'm just on my way to see my grandmother,' she replies, sidestepping him to keep the fork in view.

Wolf circles closer, feigning interest in the map, his nose twitching as he inhales the scent of bread and herbs.

He gestures grandly down the left path.

'This way is faster—trust me.

I walk these woods every day.

' Red studies him, weighing his words against her map, and resolves to trust her instincts, choosing the right fork instead.

Wolf's ears twitch in annoyance, but he retreats into the brush, planning his next move.

----------------------------------------

As Red set off along her chosen path, the forest seemed to grow quieter, branches arching overhead in a protective canopy. Behind her, Wolf melted into the shadows, his frustration sharpening into resolve. While Red pressed forward, unaware of the game unfolding around her, another story was already beginning to play out elsewhere—one that would soon draw both traveler and predator closer to the heart of danger.

# Chapter 3: Wolf's Intrusion

Red steps carefully around tangled roots, balancing the basket on her arm and scanning the undergrowth for signs of danger, motivated by her promise to her mother.

As she nears a fork in the path, Wolf, disguised as a traveling storyteller with a battered cloak, emerges from behind a fallen log, blocking her way.

Wolf greets Red with a sly grin, introducing himself and offering to guide her through a 'safer' shortcut, hoping to win her trust and affection.

Wolf leans forward slightly, his eyes glinting with mischief as he offers his paw in a gesture of polite invitation. "Well, hello there, Red. Fancy meeting you in these tangled woods. You know, not everyone knows their way around like I do. Perhaps you'd let me show you a shortcut? Much safer—and, I daresay, a bit more interesting—with me as your guide." ——Wolf

Red tilts her head thoughtfully, clutching her basket a little tighter as she studies Wolf's grin. "That's very kind of you, Wolf, but I'm not sure my grandmother would want me straying from the path—she says shortcuts can be tricky, even with a clever guide." ——Red

Wolf leans in slightly, his grin widening as he gestures invitingly down a shadowy, overgrown trail. "Ah, but that's precisely why you'd need someone clever at your side, Red—tricks and tangles are no match for sharp eyes and quick wit." ——Wolf

Red tucks her basket closer to her side, eyes flickering with both intrigue and wariness as she studies Wolf’s grin. "Maybe, but sometimes the straight path is the safest, even if it isn’t the most exciting—besides, I promised Grandmother I’d be careful." ——Red

Wolf leans in slightly, his grin widening as he gestures invitingly toward a shadowy trail off the main path. "Careful is wise, but adventure rarely waits for permission—imagine the stories you'd have to tell if you trusted me, just a little." ——Wolf

Red adjusts the basket on her arm and glances down the familiar path, her eyes flickering between the Wolf and the shaded shortcut he suggests. "Stories are wonderful, Wolf, but I’d rather bring home something for Grandmother to smile about than tales to make her worry." ——Red

Wolf leans in just a little, his eyes glinting with playful encouragement, as he gestures invitingly down an overgrown path. "Of course, Red, a thoughtful heart is a rare treasure—though perhaps, with the right company, you could bring your grandmother both a smile and a story worth telling." ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket and gives Wolf a polite but cautious smile, taking a small step back toward the familiar path. "Maybe, but I think my grandmother would prefer stories where I keep my promises, even if the adventure has to wait." ——Red

Red hesitates, gripping the basket tightly and questioning Wolf about the route, determined to protect her grandmother and herself.

Red glances nervously at the dark, tangled woods beyond the fork, her knuckles white around the basket handle as she studies Wolf's expression for any sign of deception. "Are you sure this is the right path to Grandmother's house? I always take the road by the old mill, not through the thicket. It looks dangerous—and I don't want anything to happen to her, or me." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, offering a toothy smile while subtly stepping between Red and the safer path. "Trust me, little one, this shortcut may seem wild, but it will get you there much faster—and you wouldn't want to keep your dear grandmother waiting, would you?" ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes at Wolf, clutching the basket closer to her chest and taking a cautious step back. "If it's really safer, then why have I never heard Grandmother mention this way before?" ——Red

Wolf offers a gentle, reassuring smile, gesturing invitingly toward the shadowy trail. "Ah, perhaps your grandmother wanted to spare you the trouble of brambles and mud, but I’ve wandered these woods for years and know every hidden path." ——Wolf

Red steps back slightly, clutching her basket closer and scanning the shadows for any sign of danger. "Still, I think I'd rather stick to the path I know—Grandmother always says, 'Better safe than sorry,' and I promised her I'd be careful." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, offering a sly smile as he blocks a bit more of the familiar trail with his broad frame, gesturing invitingly toward the shadowy shortcut. "Of course, but sometimes the safest paths are the ones you haven't tried yet—wouldn't you like to surprise your grandmother by arriving early?" ——Wolf

Red hugs her basket closer, taking a cautious step back and narrowing her eyes at Wolf. "But what if I get lost—or worse, if something's waiting in those shadows you know so well?" ——Red

Wolf bends forward, lowering his voice and flashing a reassuring smile, his eyes glinting just beneath the brim of his fur. "Oh, little one, the only thing waiting in those shadows is the sweet scent of wildflowers—and perhaps a friend to guide you safely through." ——Wolf

Red takes a step back, clutching her basket tighter, her eyes narrowing as she studies Wolf's face for any sign of deceit. "But how can I be sure you're truly a friend, and not just leading me somewhere I shouldn't go?" ——Red

Wolf leans in, offering a reassuring smile, but his eyes flicker with something unreadable as he gestures invitingly toward the shadowed shortcut. "Why, you can trust me because I know these woods better than anyone—and wouldn't a true friend want you and your grandmother safe and happy?" ——Wolf

Red hugs her basket close, taking a cautious step back toward the familiar path, eyes fixed warily on Wolf. "If you really want me and Grandmother safe, maybe you could walk with me on the road I know, just to be sure nothing happens." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, eyes gleaming, and steps back into the dappled shadow, inviting Red to choose her path. "Ah, but the thicket is no place for an old wolf’s bones—why not prove your courage and take the shortcut, while I watch over you from here?" ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on the basket, taking a cautious step back from Wolf, her eyes narrowed with suspicion. "If you truly cared about our safety, you'd walk beside me the whole way, not just send me off alone into the shadows." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting, as he gestures subtly toward the shadowy thicket, inviting but not moving closer. "If I walked with you, who would protect the woods from those who stray where they shouldn't—sometimes true courage means trusting the wisdom of those who've made the journey before." ——Wolf

Red steps back toward the familiar path, tightening her grip on the basket and keeping a wary eye on Wolf. "Then perhaps true wisdom is listening to the warnings of those you trust, not just the promises of strangers." ——Red

The conversation grows tense as Wolf tries to charm Red with tales of the forest, while Red insists on staying on the familiar path.

Wolf leans in, voice silky, gesturing with a lazy paw toward the shadowed woods, eyes glittering with mischief. "Did you know, Red, that just beyond these neat little stones, the forest sings with secrets? There's a hidden glen where the sunlight paints gold on the moss, and streams run so clear you can see the pebbles wink at you. It's not far at all—just a step or two from here. Wouldn't you like to see it?" ——Wolf

Red grips her basket tighter, eyes scanning the trees as if weighing the beauty against the danger. "The moss and streams sound pretty, Wolf, but Grandmother says the path is what keeps me safe, and that's exactly where I'm staying." ——Red

Wolf leans in closer, voice soft and coaxing, gesturing with a paw toward the shadowy woods. "Ah, but Red, even safety can grow dull—think how much sweeter your story would be if you brought Grandmother a wildflower no one else has ever seen." ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket, glancing pointedly at the winding path ahead. "A wildflower is lovely, but Grandmother would rather have me home on time than picking petals in places she warned me about." ——Red

Wolf leans in closer, lowering his voice to a persuasive whisper as his tail flicks with anticipation. "But imagine the look in her eyes if you returned with something truly rare—something only the bravest ever find, Red." ——Wolf

Red tightens her grip on her basket and takes a deliberate step forward along the path, her gaze unwavering. "The bravest know when to say no, Wolf, and Grandmother's eyes would be brightest just seeing me safe on her doorstep." ——Red

Ultimately, Red decides to ignore Wolf's suggestion and continues on her chosen route, leaving Wolf watching her with keen interest, plotting his next move.

----------------------------------------

As the forest path winds on beneath Red’s determined steps, the cottage ahead grows nearer, its quiet facade concealing the Wolf’s recent deception. Unaware of the danger lurking within, Red’s thoughts linger on her strange encounter, even as she crosses the threshold into a house that now feels subtly, inexplicably changed.

# Chapter 4: Red's Arrival and Suspicion

Red clutches her wicker basket and steps carefully over a tangle of roots as she approaches her grandmother's cottage.

Wolf, in his human guise, emerges from behind a leaning birch, brushing pine needles off his cloak and blocking Red's way with an exaggerated bow.

Red narrows her eyes and shifts the basket to her other arm, recalling her mother's warnings.

As Wolf circles closer, sniffing the air and commenting on the smell of fresh bread, Red remains guarded but becomes increasingly confrontational, directly accusing Wolf of following her and questioning his motives.

Wolf circles a step closer, head tilted with feigned casual interest, eyes flicking toward the basket as his nose twitches appreciatively. "Mmm, what a delightful aroma wafting through these woods. Tell me, little one, is that fresh bread I smell, or perhaps something even more tempting nestled in your basket?" ——Wolf

Red hugs the basket a bit closer to her side, her gaze flickering warily to the Wolf's sharp eyes. "Oh, it's just some bread and a little honey for my grandmother—nothing too tempting, I hope." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, voice soft and inviting, eyes glinting with calculated interest as he shifts a step nearer, pretending casual curiosity. "Ah, but sometimes the simplest treats are the sweetest—your grandmother is a lucky soul; might I ask which path you take to her cottage?" ——Wolf

Red clutches the basket a bit tighter, shifting her weight anxiously and glancing toward the winding trail ahead. "It's the sunlit path past the old oak, but I really should be on my way before the bread cools." ——Red

Wolf tries to deflect suspicion with charm, claiming curiosity and concern for her grandmother, but Red challenges each explanation, her suspicion mounting as she references past troubles associated with Wolf.

Red steps back, her eyes narrowing as she positions herself protectively between Wolf and the cottage door, her voice trembling with a mix of fear and determination. "What are you doing here, Wolf? You’re not supposed to be anywhere near this cottage. Are you following me?" ——Red

Wolf takes a slow step back, his eyes darting between Red and the cottage, feigning casual interest. "Me? Following you? No, Red—I was just passing through, thought I heard something unusual, that's all." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, taking another cautious step back, her voice trembling with both fear and resolve. "Don't lie to me—no one just 'passes through' these woods without a reason; what do you really want?" ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, watching Red closely, his eyes flickering with an unreadable intent. "Curiosity, maybe—it's not every day I catch sight of someone so determined to protect a place like this." ——Wolf

Red edges closer to the cottage door, eyes narrowed, never letting Wolf out of her sight. "Protecting it from what, exactly—wolves who pretend they're just curious, or something far worse?" ——Red

Wolf steps forward, eyes narrowing as he watches Red's reaction, voice low and probing. "You sound awfully sure there's something worse lurking, Red—maybe you ought to tell me what you're so afraid of." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, stepping sideways to block the cottage door, her body tense and ready to bolt or fight. "Maybe I would, if I thought you weren't the very thing I should be afraid of." ——Red

Wolf tilts his head, eyes narrowing, stepping just close enough for Red to feel the tension in the air. "If I were, wouldn't you already know it?" ——Wolf

Red plants her feet firmly, raising her basket like a shield, her eyes never leaving Wolf's. "Maybe I do know it, Wolf—and that's why I won't let you take another step closer." ——Red

Wolf raises his paws in a gesture of surrender, eyes fixed steadily on Red, gauging her reaction. "Easy now, Red—I'm not here to fight you, but if you think I mean you harm, maybe you should tell me why you think that." ——Wolf

Red plants her feet firmly, raising her basket defensively between them, eyes narrowed and unwavering. "Because every time you show up, something bad follows—and I'm not about to let you bring trouble to my door again." ——Red

Wolf lowers his voice, eyes narrowing as he edges a cautious step back, his gaze never leaving Red's face. "So you blame me for every shadow in these woods—tell me, Red, do you really believe I'm the only danger hiding here?" ——Wolf

Red stands her ground, eyes narrowed, her stance shifting subtly into a defensive position as she watches Wolf's every move. "I believe the real danger is the one clever enough to pretend it isn’t a threat—so tell me, Wolf, what are you really after?" ——Red

Wolf's eyes narrow as he glances toward the cottage, his stance shifting subtly, testing Red's resolve. "Maybe I'm after the truth—the kind you keep locked behind that door, Red." ——Wolf

Red stands her ground, her eyes never leaving Wolf as she shifts to block the cottage entrance, voice steady despite the tremor in her hand. "If it's truth you want, you'll have to earn it—because nothing behind this door is yours for the taking." ——Red

Their exchange grows tense, with Red refusing to let Wolf approach further and insisting on his true intentions.

Wolf flashes a wide, toothy grin, trying to appear friendly and nonchalant as he shifts his weight from paw to paw. "Oh, I was just stopping by to check on your dear grandmother. You know, making sure she's feeling well. It's what any good neighbor would do, right?" ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, folding her arms as she studies Wolf's face for any hint of deception. "Is that so? Funny, I don't remember you ever visiting before." ——Red

Wolf flashes another wide grin, leaning casually against the doorframe as Red narrows her eyes, stepping closer to peer past him into the cottage. "Well, I suppose I've just become more neighborly lately—everyone needs a little company now and then, don't you think?" ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, stepping closer to Wolf, watching his reaction carefully. "Maybe, but you seem awfully interested in her today—did something happen?" ——Red

Wolf leans forward slightly, his grin widening as he watches Red for her reaction, trying to appear sincere. "Oh, nothing out of the ordinary—I just heard she wasn't feeling herself, so I thought I'd lend a paw, that's all." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes and glances pointedly at Wolf's empty paws, shifting her basket protectively behind her. "That's considerate of you, but if she's not well, why didn't you bring anything to help?" ——Red

Wolf shrugs with an exaggerated innocence, his eyes flicking toward the closed bedroom door, trying to gauge Red's suspicion. "Ah, well, I suppose I left in such a hurry that I forgot—my concern got the better of my planning." ——Wolf

RedWolf tilts his head, eyes keen, testing Red's response as he fidgets with his paws. "If you'd like, I could fetch something now—unless you think my company alone isn't quite enough?" ——Red

Wolf gives a toothy, reassuring smile, but his eyes flicker with a hint of unease as he subtly blocks the doorway behind him. "Oh, no need for that—your company is more than enough, and besides, I wouldn't want to trouble you further." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes and steps closer to Wolf, her tone growing sharper as she studies his expression. "Still, it's curious how you appeared just when she was feeling poorly—almost as if you were expecting it." ——Red

Wolf flashes a toothy grin, his eyes flickering with restrained eagerness as he shifts his weight, subtly blocking Red's view of the bedroom door. "Well, sometimes a little intuition goes a long way—perhaps I simply have good timing." ——Wolf

RedWolf leans against the doorframe, his grin unwavering but his eyes searching Red’s face for any sign of trust. "Or maybe I just care more than you think, Red." ——Red

Red narrows her eyes and steps closer, watching Wolf's expression for any sign of deception. "Care can take many forms, Wolf, but yours seems to arrive with a hint of hunger—should I be worried?" ——Red

Wolf leans in with a playful glint in his eye, testing Red's reaction. "Worried? Oh, Red, my appetite is strictly for conversation—unless you'd prefer something spicier." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, folding her arms as she studies Wolf's expression for any crack in his charming facade. "Well, I'd hate for our conversation to get too heated, but you do have a knack for showing up when things are most. vulnerable." ——Red

Wolf leans in with a reassuring smile, though his eyes glint with an unreadable intent. "Vulnerability invites kindness—or suspicion, I suppose—but I assure you, my intentions are as harmless as a spring breeze." ——Wolf

Red narrows her eyes and steps closer, watching Wolf intently for any sign of deceit. "A spring breeze can stir up all sorts of trouble if you're not careful, Wolf—so why don't you show me exactly what you're doing here, before I decide whether to trust that grin?" ——Red

Wolf gestures toward the bedroom with a sweeping motion, his grin unwavering as he steps aside to let Red lead the way. "Of course, Red—why don't we check on your grandmother together, so you can see for yourself that my paws are clean?" ——Wolf

Wolf, rather than intimidating her, attempts to prove his innocence and neighborly concern by suggesting they check on the grandmother together.

Red, still wary, agrees conditionally, maintaining her protective stance.

Wolf lingers, watching her, his motives caught between genuine loneliness and a desire for connection, but now under sharper scrutiny from Red, who is determined to shield her grandmother and uncover Wolf's true intentions.

----------------------------------------

Outside, a sudden sound breaks the tense standoff, drawing both Red's and the Wolf's attention toward the shadowed doorway. As the uneasy silence thickens, the presence of another—unexpected and forceful—begins to make itself known, shifting the balance inside the cottage. The air grows taut with anticipation, just as footsteps approach, heralding the arrival of someone who may alter the course of their confrontation.

# Chapter 5: Woodsman Intervenes

Red, gripping her wicker basket, steps onto the stone path and knocks on her grandmother's door, her boots leaving imprints in the muddy earth.

The Wolf, disguised in a patchwork shawl, cracks the door open and tries to mimic Grandmother's frail voice, urging Red to come inside.

WolfThe Wolf pulls the shawl tighter, feigning a trembling hand as he opens the door wider, eyes glittering hungrily from the dimness within. "Oh, my sweet child, do come in. The wind is biting today, and your poor old grandmother aches so. Step closer, dear, let me see your lovely face in the light." ——Wolf

Before Red can cross the threshold, the Woodsman bursts from the underbrush, his axe slung over his shoulder, voice firm as he addresses Red: 'Wait, Red.

Something's wrong here.

' He scans the Wolf with narrowed eyes, nostrils flaring as he catches a whiff of wet fur beneath the borrowed shawl.

The Wolf, sensing threat, drops the act and bares his teeth, backing into the dim cottage.

The Woodsman stands protectively between Red and the door, axe ready, as Red inches closer, peering over his shoulder and demanding, 'Where is my grandmother?

' The Woodsman's decisive intervention halts the Wolf's deception and forces a confrontation, preventing Red from entering and prompting the Wolf to reveal his true form.

----------------------------------------

With the Wolf subdued and the grandmother safe once more, the tension in the cottage slowly ebbs, replaced by uneasy silence. Red and the Woodsman exchange wary glances, their relief tempered by the sight of the defeated Wolf. As the dust settles, a new question hangs in the air—what should be done with the creature whose actions nearly shattered their lives? The moment calls for more than mere justice; it offers an unexpected opportunity to confront anger, fear, and the possibility of mercy.

# Chapter 6: A Choice of Forgiveness

Red steps carefully over slick roots, clutching the basket and the letter as she approaches the cottage door.

Wolf, in his human guise, emerges from behind a birch tree, brushing stray twigs from his coat and sniffing the air.

He intercepts Red, bowing theatrically to block her path and asks, 'Will you trust me to help your grandmother?

' Red, recalling his earlier deception, responds with suspicion and pointed questions, making it clear she hasn’t forgotten his past behavior.

Red crosses her arms, her gaze sharp and unyielding as she watches Wolf closely for any sign of dishonesty. "Fresh water, huh? Funny how quick you are to help now, after the last time you tried to trick me. Why should I trust you to bring anything back but trouble?" ——Red

Wolf lowers his voice, keeping his stance nonthreatening as he gestures toward the distant sound of running water. "I can't blame you for doubting me, Red, but you need water, and I know these woods better than anyone—let me prove I can be useful, not just dangerous." ——Wolf

Red crosses her arms, her gaze fixed sharply on Wolf, refusing to let her guard down. "Useful doesn't erase dangerous, Wolf—so tell me, if I let you go, what's to stop you from vanishing into those trees and leaving me stranded?" ——Red

Wolf lowers his head slightly, meeting Red's gaze with a hint of sincerity, his tail still but his ears alert for her response. "If I wanted to leave you stranded, Red, I would have done it already—but I’m still here, offering help because maybe I’m more than just my mistakes." ——Wolf

Red crosses her arms, studying Wolf's face for any hint of deceit as he turns toward the stream. "Red: Maybe, but trust isn't given for free—bring back that water, and we'll see if you've earned a drop of it." ——Red

Wolf acknowledges her distrust and honestly pleads for a chance to prove he can be more than his mistakes.

Red thrusts the empty jug into Wolf’s hands, her gaze sharp with warning, but her posture betrays a flicker of hope mingled with anxiety. "Here—take this, but be quick about it. I’m counting on you to bring it back, Wolf. Don’t make me regret this." ——Red

Wolf grips the empty jug firmly, nodding with a flash of resolve before slipping into the trees. "You have my word, Red—I’ll be back before you know it." ——Wolf

Red remains guarded, refusing to offer trust easily, but allows Wolf to fetch water only after making her expectations and doubts explicit.

She sternly hands him the empty jug, warning him not to betray her trust.

Wolf promises sincerely to return quickly.

As Wolf bounds off, tail flicking beneath his coat, Red wipes mud from her boots and knocks on the cottage door, still determined but more wary than before, intent on delivering the basket and letter herself.

----------------------------------------

As the cottage door creaked open and Red stepped into the familiar warmth within, the weight of her decision lingered in the air. Outside, the Wolf’s figure disappeared into the trees, his fate no longer shaped by vengeance but by the uncertain hope of a second chance. Inside, Red’s heart wrestled with both relief and apprehension, knowing that forgiveness was only the first step on a much longer road. With the basket still in her grasp and the letter to deliver, she braced herself for whatever changes the day’s choices would bring, unaware that the path ahead would soon reveal possibilities she had never imagined.

# Chapter 7: New Beginnings

Wolf lingers at the forest border, ears twitching as he recalls Red's unexpected kindness—her offering him bread earlier that day.

Woodsman's footsteps approach, axe slung across his shoulder.

Confronting Wolf, Woodsman warns, 'Stay away from the cottage.

' Wolf, instead of acting defensive, speaks with genuine emotion: 'You know, I've roamed these woods for years, and never once have I met a soul quite like her.

Most folk run at the sight of me, but she—she offered me a piece of her bread.

Wolf sits beneath a tree, gazing thoughtfully into the distance, recalling the girl's gentle gesture. "You know, I've roamed these woods for years, and never once have I met a soul quite like her. Most folk run at the sight of me, but she—she offered me a piece of her bread, gentle as the sun in spring. Kindness like that. it catches you off guard." ——Wolf

' Woodsman observes Wolf's conflicted demeanor, recognizing a softer side.

Wolf's tail lowers, and, still longing for company, he decides not to provoke Woodsman further.

He shakes his fur and retreats deeper into the woods for now, leaving Woodsman vigilant but thoughtful, scanning the shadows and reflecting on Wolf's words as he guards Red and her grandmother.

----------------------------------------

As dusk settles over the forest, peace lingers at the edge of the trees, and a quiet hope stirs in the hearts of those who remain.
