Mother tightens Red's cloak strings, brushing off crumbs from her daughter's shoulder, and hands her the basket with a firm grip. She warns Red about the dense fog in the forest and the recent sightings of a large animal near the old birch trail. Red nods, her fingers gripping the basket handle, and promises to avoid the shortcut by the creek. Mother watches Red step onto the porch, closing the door behind her, determined to ensure Red understands the importance of delivering the basket and letter safely to Grandmother.",

She adjusts the woven basket on her arm, peering down each path in search of the quickest route to her grandmother's cottage. As she hesitates, Wolf—disguised as a lanky, dark-haired traveler in a tattered cloak—emerges from the shadows, sniffing the air and eyeing the basket. He steps into Red's path, brushing dirt from his sleeve with calculated nonchalance, and greets her with a toothy grin. 'Lost, little one?' he asks, voice smooth and curious, his gaze flicking between her face and the basket. Red grips the handle tighter, recalling her mother's warning, but forces a polite smile. 'I'm just on my way to see my grandmother,' she replies, sidestepping him to keep the fork in view. Wolf circles closer, feigning interest in the map, his nose twitching as he inhales the scent of bread and herbs. He gestures grandly down the left path. 'This way is faster—trust me. I walk these woods every day.' Red studies him, weighing his words against her map, and resolves to trust her instincts, choosing the right fork instead. Wolf's ears twitch in annoyance, but he retreats into the brush, planning his next move.",

Wolf greets Red with a sly grin, introducing himself and offering to guide her through a 'safer' shortcut, hoping to win her trust and affection. Red hesitates, gripping the basket tightly and questioning Wolf about the route, determined to protect her grandmother and herself. The conversation grows tense as Wolf tries to charm Red with tales of the forest, while Red insists on staying on the familiar path.

Red narrows her eyes and shifts the basket to her other arm, recalling her mother's warnings. Wolf circles closer, sniffing the air subtly, and remarks on the smell of fresh bread, angling to peek inside the basket. Red steps back, tightening her grip, and questions Wolf about his presence near the cottage, her suspicion clear. Wolf, motivated by his desire for connection, grins and claims he was checking on the old woman.

Before Red can cross the threshold, the Woodsman bursts from the underbrush, his axe slung over his shoulder, voice firm as he addresses Red: 'Wait, Red. Something's wrong here.' He scans the Wolf with narrowed eyes, nostrils flaring as he catches a whiff of wet fur beneath the borrowed shawl. The Wolf, sensing threat, drops the act and bares his teeth, backing into the dim cottage. The Woodsman stands protectively between Red and the door, axe ready, as Red inches closer, peering over his shoulder and demanding, 'Where is my grandmother?' The Woodsman's decisive intervention halts the Wolf's deception and forces a confrontation, preventing Red from entering and prompting the Wolf to reveal his true form.",
