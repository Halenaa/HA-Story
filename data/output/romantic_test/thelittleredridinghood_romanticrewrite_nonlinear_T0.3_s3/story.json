Damp earth carried the scent of pine and fresh rain. A crow cawed from the crooked fence as Red stepped onto the leaf-strewn path, the wooden gate creaking softly under her hand.",

She paused, noticing muddy footprints trailing across the porch and a faint, unfamiliar whistle coming from inside. Driven by curiosity and concern for her grandmother, Red knocked twice, then pushed open the door, her boots scraping against the rough boards. Wolfe, standing near the hearth and examining a row of dried herbs, turned with practiced ease, offering a courteous bow. His gaze lingered on Red's cloak as he introduced himself, explaining he was delivering firewood at Grandmother's request. Red narrowed her eyes, glancing at the stacked logs and the half-filled wood basket, then questioned his presence, her tone playful yet guarded. Wolfe answered with a sly smile, inviting her to inspect the basket herself. Their exchange grew brisk: Red circled the room, fingers brushing the cool iron kettle as she searched for signs of Grandmother, while Wolfe stepped aside, gesturing toward the back room. Both maneuvered carefully, intent on uncovering each other's true purpose—Red determined to ensure her grandmother's safety, Wolfe eager to prolong the encounter and win Red's attention.",

She paused to inspect a cluster of mushrooms, brushing her fingers across their velvety caps, when a sharp snap of a twig made her lift her head. Wolfe emerged from behind a thicket, brushing leaves from his sleeve and offering a playful bow. He greeted her with a bright grin, remarking on her basket's tempting aroma and the boldness of her crimson cloak. Red hesitated, then engaged, asking if he was lost or merely exploring. Wolfe, motivated by curiosity and desire to impress, stepped closer, plucked a wildflower, and offered it to her, his eyes twinkling. The two exchanged questions about the forest's secrets and their favorite places to wander, each circling the other with practiced charm and growing intrigue. By the time Red resumed her walk, Wolfe fell in step beside her, offering witty observations about the shapes of clouds overhead and the calls of distant birds, ensuring their meeting lingered beyond mere chance.",

With a sly grin, Wolfe adjusted his forest-green jacket, then slipped off the trail, boots barely rustling the undergrowth. He darted between twisted birch trunks, dodging brambles and brushing aside low-hanging branches, intent on reaching Grandmother's cottage first. Red, basket swinging at her side, called after him, 'Race you to Grandmother's door!' but her playful challenge faded as Wolfe vanished from view, his laughter echoing through the trees. Driven by curiosity and a desire to prove herself, Red quickened her pace, crunching twigs beneath her boots and brushing her hand along the damp bark. Wolfe, motivated by his scheme and the thrill of the chase, vaulted over a fallen log, planning his next move as the distant scent of Grandmother's baking drifted on the breeze.",

Her mother crossed the room, folding a clean cloth and tucking it into a woven basket already filled with small jars of preserves and a wedge of cheese. She paused, watching Red tuck a lock of hair beneath her red hood, and spoke in a low voice: 'If you take the forest path, keep your eyes sharp and your ears open. The woods can be full of mischief this time of year.' Red glanced up, her eyes lingering on the sunlit trees beyond the window, and nodded. She reached for the basket, feeling its rough handle, and slid her feet into sturdy boots beside the door. Her mother placed a steady hand on her shoulder, guiding her gaze to meet her own, and added, 'Promise me you’ll come straight back after seeing Grandmother.' Red hesitated, curiosity flickering as she peered at the shadowed tree line, but she nodded again, determination in her grip as she hefted the basket and stepped out onto the mossy threshold. The door closed softly behind her, the scent of hearth smoke trailing in her wake.",

Red, still wearing her red cloak, tugged the chair closer, brushing crumbs from the embroidered table runner and glancing at her grandmother's knowing smile. Without preamble, Grandmother reached into the basket at her feet and withdrew a folded letter, tapping it thoughtfully before passing it to Red. Red accepted the letter, fingers brushing the rough paper, and unfolded it to reveal Wolfe’s careful handwriting. As Red scanned the lines, Grandmother leaned forward, her voice low and conspiratorial. She revealed that she had invited Wolfe to the cottage under the guise of needing help with firewood, and confessed she had watched their growing friendship with delight. Grandmother’s hands busied themselves with refilling Red’s teacup, her eyes twinkling as she explained her matchmaking intentions. Red, surprised, traced the rim of her cup and questioned her grandmother about Wolfe’s true character. Grandmother responded by recounting specific moments she had observed—Wolfe chopping wood in the rain, pausing to check the door latch, and bringing fresh wildflowers for the kitchen windowsill—each action carefully chosen to reassure Red of his sincerity. The scene ended with Red considering the letter, her grandmother’s scheme now laid bare, as the wind rattled the cottage shutters and the fire cast long, flickering shadows across the table.",

Grandmother ladles stew into bowls, her contented smile betraying her satisfaction at orchestrating the match.
