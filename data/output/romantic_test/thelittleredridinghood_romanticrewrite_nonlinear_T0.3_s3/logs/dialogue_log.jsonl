Her concern for her grandmother heightens. She knocks, then enters, finding Wolfe by the hearth with a stack of firewood. Wolfe greets her warmly, explaining he’s there at Grandmother’s request, but Red quickly grows suspicious of his presence—her tone oscillating between playful curiosity and guarded skepticism. As Wolfe tries to distract her with offers of tea and explanations about the herbs, Red’s unease grows. She persistently questions Wolfe about Grandmother’s whereabouts and well-being, growing increasingly insistent as Wolfe offers a series of evasions and excuses, attempting to prevent her from entering the back room. Red, perceptive and courageous, refuses to be dissuaded, challenging Wolfe’s motives and arguing her right to see her grandmother. Wolfe, both protective and secretive, finally relents but warns Red to prepare herself.

She paused to inspect a cluster of mushrooms, brushing her fingers across their velvety caps, when a sharp snap of a twig made her lift her head. Wolfe emerged from behind a thicket, brushing leaves from his sleeve and offering a playful bow. Their conversation quickly deepened into a playful yet cautious verbal dance—Red, perceptive and courageous, questioned Wolfe's motives and presence in the woods, showing a mix of curiosity and wariness.

The two exchanged stories, questions, and philosophical musings about the secrets of the forest, each subtly probing the other's intentions. Their banter grew layered, blending charm with suspicion, as both acknowledged the potential dangers of trust and the allure of hidden places.

Red, basket swinging at her side, called after him, 'Race you to Grandmother's door!' but her playful challenge faded as Wolfe vanished from view, his laughter echoing through the trees. Driven by curiosity and a desire to prove herself, Red quickened her pace, crunching twigs beneath her boots and brushing her hand along the damp bark.
