        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue presents a more tense and suspicious exchange than the original plot summary, with Red increasingly challenging Wolfeâ€™s evasions and Wolfe offering more elaborate excuses to stall her. The updated plot emphasizes Red's suspicion and determination, and Wolfe's defensive maneuvers, providing a natural escalation toward confrontation while preserving character motivations.",

Red is more perceptive and cautious, directly questioning Wolfe and referencing danger, while Wolfe is less overtly charming and more mysterious. Their interaction is less purely flirtatious and more mutual probing and banter about trust and secrets. Updated plot reflects this increased tension and guardedness while maintaining their motivations.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue introduces a new element: Grandmother warning Red about dangers in the woods and sharing a rhyme, emphasizing caution and mistrust that was not present in the original plot summary. The dialogue also expands Grandmother's matchmaking beyond Wolfe to include Henry, which shifts her motivation from solely encouraging Red and Wolfe's romance to supporting Red's happiness more broadly, possibly with other suitors. Additionally, the dialogue explores Grandmother's conflicted feelings about Wolfe (both wary and sympathetic), while the original plot presents her as mostly supportive and reassuring of Wolfe's character. The updated plot incorporates these new angles, ensuring consistency between dialogue and plot.",
