# Chapter 4: Red Arrives and Confronts Wolfe

Red, adjusting her hood as she reaches the cottage, notices muddy footprints and an unfamiliar whistle from within.

Her concern for her grandmother heightens.

She knocks, then enters, finding Wolfe by the hearth with a stack of firewood.

Wolfe greets her warmly, explaining he’s there at Grandmother’s request, but Red quickly grows suspicious of his presence—her tone oscillating between playful curiosity and guarded skepticism.

As Wolfe tries to distract her with offers of tea and explanations about the herbs, Red’s unease grows.

Wolfe offers a polite smile, but his eyes linger a touch too long on the bright red cloak, his tone warm yet edged with a curious intensity. Wolfe’s smile was polite, practiced, but his gaze lingered a fraction too long on the vivid sweep of Red’s cloak, as if weighing its significance. “You must be Red,” he said, voice warm and easy, yet edged with a curious intensity. “Your cloak is exactly as your grandmother described.” He shifted the bundle of firewood in his arms, a subtle gesture of familiarity. “I’m Wolfe—the one she asked to bring more wood for her hearth. She worries about the chill settling in these woods.” His tone softened, conspiratorial. “I often help her with these things, you know.” His eyes flicked over the lonely path behind her, and he added playfully, “It’s a long walk for someone as young as you. Do you always travel alone?”
She persistently questions Wolfe about Grandmother’s whereabouts and well-being, growing increasingly insistent as Wolfe offers a series of evasions and excuses, attempting to prevent her from entering the back room.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans casually against a log, her arms crossed loosely, a small smile playing at her lips as she watches him over the rim of her hood, eyes sharp and curious. Red leaned casually against a mossy log, her arms folded in an easy, loose manner, a small, knowing smile tugging at the corners of her mouth. She watched him from beneath the shadow of her crimson hood, eyes bright and inquisitive as she took in the stacked logs and the half-filled basket at his feet. “You’ve certainly been busy out here with that ax,” she remarked, her tone playful but edged with curiosity. “That’s quite a pile for just one morning.” After a brief pause, she tilted her head, studying him more closely. “Tell me, what brings you so deep into these woods today?” she asked, her gaze sharp and searching. “Is it just the firewood—or is there something else on your mind?”
Red, perceptive and courageous, refuses to be dissuaded, challenging Wolfe’s motives and arguing her right to see her grandmother.

Wolfe rests his hand lightly atop the basket's lid, his eyes glinting with mischief as he subtly nudges it toward her. Wolfe rested his hand lightly atop the basket's lid, a playful glint sparking in his eyes as he nudged it subtly in her direction. His smile curled with sly invitation, as if the secret within was meant just for her. Why spoil the surprise with words, his expression seemed to suggest, when she could lift the lid and discover—and perhaps even taste—the contents herself? His gaze lingered, coaxing her onward. Go on, he seemed to beckon without speaking, have a look.
Wolfe, both protective and secretive, finally relents but warns Red to prepare herself.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red traces her fingertips along the kettle, eyes narrowing as she glances at the shadows stretching toward the curtained doorway, her footsteps slow and deliberate. Red hesitated on the threshold, her fingers tightening around the basket’s handle as she peered into the dim cottage. “Grandmother?” she called, her tone laced with curiosity and a flicker of unease. The voice that had greeted her moments ago still echoed oddly in her mind, rougher and more distant than she remembered. She stepped further inside, her nose wrinkling at the unfamiliar scent lingering in the air. “Your voice sounded so strange when I arrived,” she ventured, glancing toward the shadowed back room where her grandmother was supposedly resting. “Are you sure she’s just resting in the back? It smells different in here.” Red’s gaze swept the room, her innate perceptiveness pricking at the edges of her courage as she tried to make sense of the changes around her.
Wolfe moves between Red and the doorway to the back room, his gaze steady but watchful. Wolfe angled himself between Red and the doorway to the back room, a subtle barrier cloaked in charm. His gaze lingered on her—steady, but with a glimmer of mischief beneath the surface. “Perhaps it’s the herbs I brewed earlier,” he offered, voice smooth as velvet. He gestured lightly toward the table, his smile inviting yet enigmatic. “Why don’t you sit and have some tea while you wait?” The suggestion slipped easily from his lips, warm and coaxing, as if the notion were meant purely for her comfort, though his watchful eyes never drifted from her movements.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red moves past Wolfe, her eyes narrowed as she glances toward the shadowy doorway at the back. Red edged past Wolfe, her fingers trailing absently along the rim of the cool iron kettle as she circled the cramped room. Her eyes, bright and wary, flicked toward the shadowed doorway at the back where lamplight failed to reach. “Thank you, but I’d rather check on Grandmother myself—she usually greets me right away,” she said, her words gentle yet edged with a quiet resolve, her gaze never straying far from the uncertain darkness beyond.
Wolfe swiftly moves toward a dusty shelf, blocking Red’s path with a practiced, almost casual step. Wolfe moved with a swift, almost feline grace, his shoulder brushing just close enough to the dusty shelf to send a faint cloud swirling between them. Red’s path was blocked before she could cross to the far corner, his positioning practiced yet seemingly effortless. He offered her a reassuring smile, his tone playful but edged with something unreadable. “I assure you, she’s quite comfortable,” he said, glancing toward the shadowed doorway with a hint of mischief flickering behind his eyes. “The room is a bit dim, though. Let me fetch a lamp before you go in.” With that, he turned, the lines of his posture relaxed yet alert, as if every movement was a careful negotiation between charm and secrecy.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red edges closer to the doorway, her eyes darting around the shadowy corners and her grip tightening on the basket. Red edged closer to the doorway, her eyes flitting nervously through the shadowy corners as she tightened her grip on the basket’s worn handle. She moved with the careful curiosity of someone afraid to disturb a delicate peace, yet unable to resist the urge to peek inside. Fingertips grazing the cool iron kettle, she circled the room, craning her neck toward the dim bed. If her grandmother was resting, Red told herself, she could be silent as snowfall—she just wanted to see her, if only for a moment.
Wolfe steps between Red and the doorway, hands clasped lightly, blocking her path with a gentle but unmistakable barrier. Wolfe stepped lightly between Red and the doorway, his hands clasped in an easy, unhurried gesture—a barrier that was gentle, yet left little question as to its purpose. His eyes danced with playful concern as he regarded her. “You wouldn’t want to disturb her dreams,” he murmured, voice low and coaxing, a hint of mischief tucked behind his courteous smile. “She’s been so weary lately, and sudden noises might startle her.” The words slipped out as much a warning as a plea, delivered with the sort of charm that made it hard to tell where sincerity ended and cunning began.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tiptoes toward the doorway, eyes narrowed, scanning for any movement or sign of her grandmother beyond the dim-lit threshold. Red tiptoed toward the doorway, her eyes narrowed, searching for any sign of movement beyond the dim-lit threshold. The hush of the cottage pressed close around her as she circled the room, fingers brushing the cool iron kettle. She grinned to herself, recalling how her grandmother always seemed to sense her presence, even in the deepest sleep. With a playful whisper, she promised the shadows, "I’ll tread softly—Grandmother always knows when I’m near, even in her sleep."
Wolfe steps forward, blocking the narrow doorway to the back room with a subtle shift, his gaze fixed on Red’s movements. Wolfe stepped forward, a subtle shift that blocked the narrow doorway to the back room, his posture both inviting and implacable. His gaze tracked Red’s restless movements—her fingers brushing the cool iron kettle as she searched—before he offered, with a playful tilt of his lips, “If you insist, perhaps I should accompany you. Her eyes have grown sensitive, after all, and she may not recognize you at first.” The words hung in the air, half suggestion, half challenge, delivered with the easy charm that seemed to shimmer just beneath his affable manners.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sharply at Wolfe, her hand hovering over the latch of the back room door, eyes narrowed with mounting suspicion. Red’s fingers hovered above the latch of the back room door, her eyes narrowing as she shot Wolfe a sharp glance. Suspicion flickered in her gaze, but her voice remained steady, carrying an edge of spirited independence. “I’d rather go alone, thank you—I know Grandmother’s ways better than anyone.” As she spoke, she circled the room, her hand trailing along the cool curve of the iron kettle, every movement betraying both her wariness and her unwavering resolve.
Wolfe steps neatly between Red and the back room, subtly blocking her path while fussing with a folded shawl draped over a nearby chair. Wolfe, with an easy grace, stepped between Red and the back room, his hand fussing absently with a folded shawl draped over the nearest chair. A playful glint flickered in his eyes as he looked her way, the faintest curve of a smile teasing his lips. “Then perhaps I should tidy up first,” he suggested, his tone as light as the dust motes spinning in the sunlit air. “She’d be embarrassed to have you see her so unkempt—you know how particular she is.” The words slipped out so smoothly that for a moment, it was unclear whether he referred to the absent hostess or himself, but the subtle shift of his body made his intent unmistakable: Red would have to wait.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, lingering by the doorway to the back room, her hand tightening on her basket as she glances from Wolfe to the shadowed hall. Red lingered at the threshold to the back room, her fingers tightening around the wicker handle of her basket. She shot an uneasy glance from Wolfe—whose gaze never quite met hers—to the shadowed hallway beyond. Circling the small cottage, she let her hand skim over the cool iron of the kettle, her brow furrowing in quiet puzzlement. “That’s odd,” she murmured, more to herself than to anyone in the room, “Grandmother never minds my visits, no matter how she looks.” The words hung in the hush, her curiosity prickling with something sharper now as she studied the unfamiliar stiffness in the air.
Wolfe blocks the doorway subtly, placing himself between Red and the back room, his eyes flickering uneasily toward the shadows beyond. Wolfe shifted almost imperceptibly, angling his body so that he stood squarely between Red and the shadowed doorway to the back room. His eyes darted, just once, to the gloom beyond before he caught himself and returned her gaze with a disarming smile. "Perhaps," he allowed, voice light with practiced ease, "but today she insisted—truly, she was most adamant about her privacy." The words tumbled from his lips with a casual charm, yet beneath the veneer, a flicker of unease betrayed him.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, edging closer to the threshold, her hand tightening protectively around the basket she carries. Red's grip tightened around her basket as she edged nearer to the threshold, curiosity sharpening her gaze. She circled the room, fingertips grazing the cold iron of the kettle, all the while her senses pricking with unease. It was odd—her grandmother always called out the moment she heard Red’s footsteps. Yet now, a figure lingered in the doorway, posture rigid, seeming almost to bar her entry. Red paused, her voice quietly perceptive as she wondered aloud why anyone would stand sentry like that, blocking her way when everything about this cottage should have felt familiar.
Wolfe shifts slightly, maintaining his position between Red and the back room, his gaze steady but his grip tightening on the doorframe. Wolfe shifted just enough to keep himself firmly between Red and the door to the back room, his handsome features arranged in an easy smile. Still, Red caught the subtle way his fingers tightened around the doorframe, as if bracing against more than just the weight of the old wood. “Old habits, I suppose,” he remarked, his tone light, but his gaze unwavering. “One grows protective when illness lingers in the house.” The words drifted out almost playfully, but there was a flicker of something more complicated behind his eyes—an instinct, perhaps, or a warning barely concealed beneath the charm.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, her grip tightening on her basket as she steps closer to Wolfe, refusing to be intimidated. Red narrowed her eyes, her grip tightening around the wicker handle of her basket as she stepped closer to Wolfe, refusing to give ground. With a playful tilt of her head, she let her fingers drift over the cool iron kettle, circling the room as if she might find answers hidden in its shadows. “Protective, or secretive?” she asked, her voice edged with both curiosity and challenge. “Because I can’t help but feel you’re hiding something from me.”
Wolfe shifts his stance subtly, widening his frame across the doorway, eyes flickering to the shadowed back room as if guarding its threshold. Wolfe shifted his stance, broadening his shoulders just enough to fill the doorway, a casual barrier that belied the flicker of calculation in his eyes. His gaze darted—almost imperceptibly—toward the shadowed recesses of the back room, as if he were the sole sentinel of whatever secrets might slumber there. Yet when he spoke, his tone was light, almost teasing, the corners of his mouth quirking in a disarming smile. “You mistake caution for secrecy, child—my only wish is to spare you any distress.” The words rolled from him with practiced ease, an artful blend of concern and charm, even as his posture remained carefully, purposefully, in the way.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes narrowing as she edges closer to the door, her posture tense and ready. Red tightened her grip on the basket, knuckles whitening as she edged closer to the door. Her eyes, bright with both worry and determination, narrowed in suspicion. Circling the room with deliberate steps, she let her fingers trail along the cool iron kettle—a tether to reality as her heart drummed in her chest. Her voice, steady but laced with urgency, broke the taut silence. If he truly wished to spare her distress, she insisted, then she must see for herself that Grandmother was safe.
Wolfe steps aside at last, lingering in the shadowed doorway, eyes fixed on Red with a measured, unreadable expression. Wolfe finally shifted, stepping aside with practiced ease, though he lingered in the shadowed doorway as if the darkness itself were a cloak he wore by choice. His gaze found Red, lingering on her with a look that revealed nothing—measured, unreadable, and edged with a cunning amusement that belied his affable manners. As Red circled the room, her fingers trailing absently across the cool iron kettle in her search, Wolfe’s voice slipped into the hush, playful yet warning. “Very well,” he murmured, the words curling around her like smoke, “but do prepare yourself—she may not appear as you remember.”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red fixes Wolfe with a steady, defiant stare, her hand tightening on the basket as she edges closer to the doorway. Red’s gaze never wavered from Wolfe, her eyes steady and defiant as she tightened her grip on the basket—knuckles blanching white. She edged closer to the doorway, determination sparking behind her playful bravado. The brisk exchange left the air taut with suspense, but Red would not be cowed. Fingers brushed the cool iron kettle as she circled the room, heart thumping with anticipation. Whatever waited beyond that door, she thought fiercely, she’d rather face it head-on than stand here, lost in anxious guesses. “Please,” she said, voice clear and unwavering as she fixed Wolfe with that spirited stare, “step aside.”
The chapter ends with Red demanding to see her grandmother, determined to face the truth for herself.

----------------------------------------

As the echo of Red’s determination still lingered in the quiet house, a sudden shift in the air signaled that her journey was far from over. Stepping out from the tense confrontation with Wolfe, Red found herself drawn toward the edge of the woods, where an unfamiliar presence awaited—one that would challenge everything she thought she knew about strangers and trust.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Charming Stranger

Red adjusted her red cloak as she trod the uneven path, balancing a wicker basket filled with fresh bread and wildflowers.

She paused to inspect a cluster of mushrooms, brushing her fingers across their velvety caps, when a sharp snap of a twig made her lift her head.

Wolfe emerged from behind a thicket, brushing leaves from his sleeve and offering a playful bow.

Their conversation quickly deepened into a playful yet cautious verbal dance—Red, perceptive and courageous, questioned Wolfe's motives and presence in the woods, showing a mix of curiosity and wariness.

Wolfe leans in, nostrils flaring with appreciation, eyes glinting with curiosity as he circles Red at a polite distance, keenly observing the basket and cloak. Wolfe’s grin flashed as he circled Red at a courteous distance, nostrils flaring with open appreciation. His gaze lingered on the bold sweep of her cloak—a hue so vivid it seemed, in his eyes, capable of rousing the whole forest from its deepest dreams. He tipped his head, eyes glinting with playful curiosity, and let the tempting aroma from her basket draw him closer still, as if each step was guided by the promise of a hidden feast. “That shade you wear,” he remarked with a teasing warmth, “could wake the woods themselves. And unless my nose is playing tricks, you’ve brought along a banquet fit for royalty.” His voice, soft yet edged with mischief, invited her confidence. “Tell me, Red—where does a traveler like you discover such splendid scents and colors?”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her basket invitingly, her eyes cautious but curious as she watches Wolfe's reaction. Red tilted her basket invitingly toward Wolfe, her fingers light on the handle, as if she were sharing a secret. Caution flickered in her eyes, tempered by her irrepressible curiosity. “The cloak?” she replied, voice bright with pride. “It was a gift from my grandmother.” A playful smile curved her lips as she nudged the lid aside just enough for the fragrant steam to escape. “And the bread inside is still warm from her oven—would you like to smell for yourself?”
Wolfe leans in slightly, inhaling the warm aroma from the basket, his eyes glinting with eager curiosity as he matches Red's pace along the path. Wolfe leaned in just enough to catch the warm, buttery aroma wafting from Red’s basket, a playful glint sparking in his eyes as he matched her stride along the sun-dappled path. With a bright, conspiratorial grin, he let his gaze linger on the basket, his tone light and teasing. He couldn’t resist remarking that her grandmother must be a marvel—after all, the scent alone was enough to set his own stomach rumbling. Glancing sidelong at Red, Wolfe’s voice softened with a charm both genuine and sly as he asked if he might walk a little way with her, eager to hear more about these home-baked wonders that seemed to promise so much delight.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red lifts the basket slightly toward Wolfe, her eyes bright with curiosity but her grip firm, as she steps forward along the winding trail. Red lifted her basket ever so slightly toward Wolfe, her eyes alight with curiosity even as her fingers tightened protectively around the handle. The aroma of fresh bread and wild strawberries drifted between them, mingling with the scent of pine. With a playful tilt of her head, she stepped forward along the winding trail, her red cloak catching the dappled sunlight. “If you promise not to gobble up all my stories at once,” she said, her voice warm and teasing, “I’d welcome the company—it's a lonely path through these woods.”
Wolfe steps lightly beside Red, his gaze flickering from the basket to the swirling red of her cloak, as if trying to memorize every detail. Wolfe fell into step beside Red, his smile bright as sunlight filtering through the trees. His gaze lingered on the basket swinging at her side, then drifted to the vivid swirl of her cloak, as if he meant to memorize every shade and fold. “You know,” he said, voice rich with playful promise, “I intend to savor each of your stories as slowly as I would a warm loaf fresh from the oven.” His lips curled in a half-smirk, eyes twinkling with secret amusement. “After all, I’ve always believed the woods only reveal their secrets to those who walk among them in good company.” As they continued along the path, Wolfe’s words hung between them, lingering like the tempting aroma from her basket and weaving a subtle mystery through the morning air.
Wolfe responded with wit and hints of mystery, never fully revealing his intentions but matching Red’s guarded openness with his own.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grips her basket tighter, eyes never leaving Wolfe, her voice polite but edged with wariness as she steps lightly to the side, keeping some distance between them. Red’s fingers tightened around the handle of her basket, the woven reeds creaking softly beneath her grip. She kept her gaze fixed on Wolfe, her posture light but watchful as she shifted a careful step to the side, always maintaining a sliver of distance between them. “Excuse me, sir,” she ventured, her tone polite yet edged with a wariness that belied her playful curiosity. “I couldn’t help but notice you watching the path. Are you lost out here, or just wandering for the view?” Her eyes flicked over his unfamiliar features, sharp and searching, as she added with a tilt of her head, “Not many strangers travel this deep into the woods.”
Wolfe offers a thin, unreadable smile, his gaze lingering on Red just a moment too long before drifting back to the shadows between the trees. Wolfe offered Red a thin, unreadable smile, his gaze lingering on her just a heartbeat longer than courtesy allowed. The shadows between the trees seemed to call to him, and he let his eyes drift away, as if half-listening to secrets only he could hear. “A little of both, perhaps,” he said at last, his tone light but edged with something more elusive. “These woods have a way of drawing in those with questions and keeping their answers well hidden, don’t you think?”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket and takes a half-step back, watching Wolfe's eyes for any flicker of intent. Red tightened her grip on the basket, the woven handle pressing into her palm as she took a cautious half-step back. She watched Wolfe closely, searching his eyes for any flicker of intent—whether danger or something stranger still. The woods felt vast and secretive around them, but her curiosity outpaced her wariness. "Maybe," she said, her voice threading through the hush of the trees. "But the woods have a way of showing people exactly what they're looking for—even if they didn’t know it when they wandered in." Her words hung in the cool air, half challenge, half wonder, as if she herself wasn’t sure whether she spoke of him, herself, or the ancient forest that watched them both.
WolfeRed shifts her basket to her other arm, her eyes never leaving Wolfe as she subtly steps sideways, keeping a safe distance yet not breaking the conversation. Red shifted her basket to her other arm, the woven handle digging lightly into her palm as she edged a fraction farther along the mossy path. Her gaze lingered on Wolfe, wary but curious, her voice threading through the hush of the woods. “And what is it you hope to find, sir—answers or something else?”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket closer, subtly stepping back to gauge Wolfe's reaction, her gaze never leaving his face. Red shifted her basket a little closer to her side, unconsciously stepping back as she studied Wolfe’s face, searching for any flicker of intent behind his lingering gaze. Her voice carried both caution and curiosity as she engaged, “I’m hoping to find my grandmother’s cottage,” she said, her eyes never straying from him. At the same time, she let her words reveal a deeper awareness, adding with spirited resolve, “but I keep a careful eye out for anything unexpected—especially those who linger where few dare tread.”
Wolfe tilts his head, a faint glint in his eye as he steps just slightly closer, the dappled sunlight barely touching his shadowed face. Wolfe tilted his head, a faint glint flickering in his eye as he stepped just a touch closer, the dappled sunlight barely grazing the edge of his shadowed face. His voice carried a playful warning, the words curling around Red’s question with practiced charm: curiosity, he mused, could be a dangerous lantern in the dark—especially when it lured someone toward places best left undisturbed. The hint of mischief lingered in his tone, even as his posture invited trust, masking whatever secrets he kept hidden just beneath the surface.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze steady but wary as she takes a cautious step closer to Wolfe. Red’s fingers tightened around the wicker handle of her basket as she edged a step closer, her eyes never leaving Wolfe’s face. Curiosity flickered beneath her wary gaze—a spark of something braver than fear alone. She tilted her head, considering him, then spoke with a gentle firmness that belied her youth. Sometimes, she thought aloud, the only way to know was to ask, even if the answers weren’t quite what you hoped for.
WolfeRed tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze steady but wary as she takes a small step back, keeping distance between herself and Wolfe. Red’s fingers tightened around the handle of her basket, knuckles paling as she measured the distance between them, every muscle taut with caution. Yet her voice held steady as she took a deliberate step back, eyes never leaving Wolfe’s. “If you’re only wandering,” she said, probing for any sign of mischief behind his easy smile, “then you won’t mind telling me what brings you this far from the main road.”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red steps just out of Wolfe's reach, eyes narrowing as she studies his expression for any sign of deceit. Red took a cautious step back, just out of Wolfe’s reach. Her eyes narrowed, searching his face for the twitch of a lie or the shadow of a secret, but his expression remained unreadable. She tilted her head, playful curiosity sharpening into wary challenge. “I could ask you the same,” she said, voice light but edged with intent. “But it’s usually the ones with nothing to hide who answer first.”
Wolfe tilts his head, a faint, unreadable smile flickering as his gaze lingers on Red, measuring her reaction. Wolfe tilted his head, a faint smile flickering at the corner of his mouth—unreadable, but undeniably present—as his gaze lingered on Red. He seemed to be measuring her reaction, weighing the effect of his presence. “Perhaps it’s the thrill of crossing paths with someone who asks all the right questions,” he said, voice low and playful, as if sharing a secret meant only for her. His eyes glinted with something mischievous, a hint of challenge in their depths, before he added, “Or maybe I’m simply drawn to secrets others would rather keep hidden.” The words hung between them, threaded with flirtation and something more elusive, as Wolfe’s effortless charm danced just beyond Red’s reach.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, narrowing her eyes as she studies Wolfe's face for any flicker of true intent. Red tightened her grip on the wicker basket, the weight of it grounding her in the hush of the forest path. She narrowed her eyes, studying Wolfe’s face for any flicker of true intent beneath his inscrutable smile. There was a playful tilt to her voice, but her gaze was sharp; she’d learned that secrets could be prickly things, best handled with care. “Secrets have a way of biting back if you prod them too hard,” she said, letting the words linger like a warning. Then, with a curious tilt of her head, Red pressed on, her courage nudging aside hesitation. “So tell me—are you searching for something you lost, or just hoping to find someone who won’t notice you following their trail?”
Wolfe's gaze lingers a fraction too long on Red's basket, a faint, unreadable smile flickering at the edge of his mouth as he shifts his weight, blending almost seamlessly into the shadow of a twisted tree. Wolfe’s gaze lingered a moment too long on the basket nestled in Red’s arm, a flicker of something unreadable tracing his lips before he shifted his weight, half-disappearing into the crooked shadow of the old tree. When Red hesitated, questioning whether he was lost or simply exploring, he let a playful note slip into his voice, as if confiding a secret meant only for her: “Some trails are worth following, even if they’re not meant for every set of footprints—wouldn’t you agree?”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, shifting her basket to her other arm and glancing down the path to gauge just how alone they truly are. Red narrowed her eyes, shifting the weight of her basket to her other arm as she glanced down the winding path, her senses alert for any sign that they weren’t quite alone after all. Hesitation flickered in her chest, but curiosity pressed her forward. "I suppose," she said, her voice light yet edged with caution, "that depends on whether the footsteps behind you mean trouble, or if they're just as lost as you claim to be."
Wolfe's gaze lingers on Red, his smile unreadable, as he takes a slow step closer, the leaves crunching beneath his feet. Wolfe’s gaze lingered on Red, his eyes shadowed by a smile that offered no easy answers. He took a slow step closer, the crunch of leaves beneath his boots punctuating the hush between them. “Trouble,” he murmured, voice light as if sharing a secret, “rarely announces itself—sometimes it prefers to walk quietly alongside until the right moment arrives.” The words slipped out almost playfully, but a subtle tension rippled beneath, as though Wolfe himself was well acquainted with the silent arrival of mischief.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grips the basket tighter, her eyes narrowing as she studies Wolfe's posture for any sign of threat. Red’s fingers curled tighter around the wicker handle of her basket as she regarded Wolfe with a mixture of curiosity and caution. He stood unnaturally still, his shoulders slack but his eyes alert—too alert, she thought—for someone merely wandering the woods. Her voice, light yet edged with wariness, broke the hush between them. “Sometimes, the quiet ones are the most dangerous,” she said, tilting her head as if weighing the truth of her own words. “Especially when they know these woods better than anyone else.” The wind rustled through the leaves overhead, but Red barely noticed; she was focused on Wolfe’s every move, determined not to let her naïveté outpace her courage.
Wolfe's gaze lingers on Red, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes as he takes a slow step closer, blending shadow and smile. Wolfe’s gaze lingered on Red, a flicker of something unreadable passing through his eyes. He took a slow step closer, letting the shadows and the curve of his smile blur together. "Then perhaps," he said, his voice low and almost playful, "it's best we both keep our eyes open—for the woods can turn on friend or foe without warning." The words hung between them, light on his tongue but edged with quiet warning, as if he knew just how quickly the forest’s secrets could shift.
The two exchanged stories, questions, and philosophical musings about the secrets of the forest, each subtly probing the other's intentions.

Their banter grew layered, blending charm with suspicion, as both acknowledged the potential dangers of trust and the allure of hidden places.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, a mischievous spark in her eyes as she steps lightly over a fallen branch, her red cloak brushing the undergrowth. She keeps her gaze steady on Wolfe, inviting him to share while keeping her own secrets close. Red tilted her head, a mischievous spark flickering in her eyes as she stepped lightly over a fallen branch, her familiar red cloak brushing the tangled undergrowth. She glanced at Wolfe, her gaze steady and inviting—a silent challenge to share, though she kept her own secrets tucked safely away. “You know,” she mused, her voice soft with curiosity, “I always thought the forest belonged to the trees and the shadows.” Yet as she spoke, her fingers brushed the moss along the path. “Lately, I wonder if it belongs more to its secrets.” She smiled, remembering her hidden sanctuary deep in the woods. “There’s a place I go when I don’t want to be found—where the moss grows so thick, even your footsteps are swallowed whole.” Her eyes glimmered with playful daring as she looked back to him. “But what about you, Wolfe? Do you have a favorite spot, or do you prefer to keep moving, never leaving a trace?”
Wolfe circles closer, eyes glinting with curiosity, as if weighing whether to share more or lure Red deeper into conversation. Wolfe drifted closer, his steps unhurried, as if he were circling the answer itself. A sly glint flickered in his eyes, betraying the playful curiosity beneath his composed exterior. “You know, Red,” he began, voice low and conspiratorial, “there’s a nook I favor, hidden where the brambles knot so tightly only the sly or the desperate bother squeezing through.” He let the words hang, watching her reaction with a half-smile. “It’s the spot I go to listen to the wind gossip,” Wolfe added softly, almost as if sharing a secret. Yet even as he confided this, an amused crease played at the edge of his mouth, hinting that the forest, for all its whispers, still kept some mysteries from him alone.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, a sly smile playing at her lips as she circles a tree, eyes never leaving Wolfe. Red tilted her head, that sly, knowing smile curling at the corners of her lips as she slowly circled the gnarled old tree, her gaze never straying from Wolfe. There was a playful spark in her eyes, the kind that suggested she saw more than she let on. "Maybe the forest likes to keep us guessing," she mused, her tone light yet edged with curiosity. Her fingers brushed the rough bark as she passed, and she looked at Wolfe with a conspiratorial glint. "Do you ever wonder what it hides from even those who think they know it best?"
Wolfe circles a little closer, eyes glinting with curiosity and the hint of a challenge, as if inviting Red to share a secret of her own. Wolfe drifted a step closer, the curve of his smile playful yet edged with something sharper—a glimmer of curiosity that danced in his eyes, as if daring Red to confess a secret of her own. He glanced up at the silvered canopy, where moonlight trembled between the leaves, and for a moment his voice was low, almost conspiratorial. “It happens every time the moonlight flickers just so,” he admitted, gaze unsettled. “Makes me question whether I’m the hunter here... or simply another story whispered through the leaves.” The words lingered, teasing at the boundaries between myth and reality, inviting her to decide which he might be.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, her eyes glinting with curiosity and caution, as if daring Wolfe to share more. Red leaned forward, her crimson cloak pooling around her shoulders, eyes glinting with a mixture of curiosity and caution. She regarded Wolfe as if daring him to reveal more, her tone playful yet edged with something deeper. “Perhaps we’re both just stories the forest tells to itself,” she mused, voice soft but clear amid the hush of leaves, “hoping we never quite unravel its last secret.”
By the time Red resumed her walk, Wolfe fell in step beside her, their rapport marked by mutual intrigue, a shared sense of caution, and the beginnings of trust amid the uncertainty of the woods.

Wolfe matches Red’s pace, glancing upward with a sly smile, his tone teasing yet inviting as he gestures toward the sky. Wolfe matched Red’s stride with effortless ease, his presence at once disarming and intriguing. As they wove between the trees, he tipped his head back to study the drifting clouds, a sly smile curving his lips. “You know, Red,” he mused, his tone light and teasing, “if clouds could gossip, I suspect they'd have plenty to say about strangers sharing woodland paths.” His eyes sparkled with mischief as he gestured skyward, inviting her to join in the joke. “I wonder what they'd make of us.”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances at Wolfe with a sidelong smile, her basket swinging lightly at her side. Red glanced at Wolfe with a sidelong smile, the hem of her red cloak fluttering as her basket swung lightly at her side. She matched his pace with easy confidence, letting his witticisms ripple through the quiet stretch of forest. “Perhaps they’d wonder which of us is the stranger,” she mused aloud, voice lilting with playful curiosity, “and which the story worth telling.” Her eyes sparkled, half mischief and half challenge, as if daring him to answer.
Wolfe glances upward, then back at Red with a half-smile, matching his pace to hers as the path narrows beneath the dappled sunlight. Wolfe glanced upward, his gaze tracing the tangled branches where sunlight slanted through in golden ribbons, then looked back at Red with a half-smile that seemed to carry a secret. As the path narrowed and shadows flickered across their steps, he effortlessly matched his pace to hers, his presence both reassuring and mischievous. "You know," he murmured, voice low enough to blend with the rustle of leaves, "sometimes the best stories begin with uncertain introductions—perhaps the tales spun above are already weaving us together in ways neither of us expect." The words lingered between them, playful yet edged with possibility, as if the very air conspired to draw their fates closer with each step.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances upward, a small smile playing at her lips as she tucks a stray lock of hair behind her ear, her steps measured but unhurried. Red glanced upward, a playful smile curling at the corners of her lips as she tucked a stray lock of hair behind her ear. Her steps remained measured and unhurried, even as Wolfe matched his pace to hers, his voice weaving clever commentary about the shifting clouds above. “Then let’s hope the clouds are gentle narrators,” she mused, her tone light but edged with a perceptive wariness. “For I’ve never liked stories that turn dark too quickly.”
Wolfe glances sideways with a sly smile, matching his measured pace to hers, letting the silence stretch just enough to invite her next thought. Wolfe cast a sideways glance at Red, his sly smile barely lifting at the corner as he matched her stride with a practiced ease. The hush between them stretched, pleasant and teasing, like a secret only they shared. When he finally spoke, his voice was light and playful, yet there was an undercurrent of something more. He tipped his head toward the dappled sunlight filtering through the leaves and remarked, “I assure you, Red, I much prefer sunshine—though a hint of shadow does make the light more interesting.” The words lingered between them, bright as the morning and edged with a subtle mischief, inviting her to wonder just what he meant.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Wolfe, her basket swinging lightly at her side, measuring his reaction with a half-smile. Red glanced sideways at Wolfe, the basket at her side swaying with her playful stride. A half-smile tugged at her lips as she measured his reaction, her eyes alight with curiosity. “Interesting light draws curious eyes,” she mused, voice soft but teasing, “but I suppose you don’t mind being watched, Wolfe?”
Wolfe flashes a sly grin, matching her pace as he glances sideways, inviting Red’s gaze to linger just a moment longer. Wolfe fell in step beside her, his presence as effortless as the sway of shadows at dusk. A sly grin played at the corner of his mouth as he matched her pace, eyes catching hers with a glint of mischief that seemed to linger just a heartbeat longer than necessary. “Not at all—after all, what’s the point of a striking silhouette if not to be noticed?” he mused, his tone light and conspiratorial, as though sharing a secret meant only for the two of them.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Wolfe, her fingers tightening slightly around the basket’s handle as she steps just a bit further from the path’s edge. Red felt Wolfe’s presence settle beside her like a shadow—close, but never quite brushing against her. As she resumed her walk, she stole a glance his way, her fingers tightening a fraction around the handle of her basket. The path narrowed, and she instinctively edged just a little farther from its rim, not wanting to lose her footing or her composure. Wolfe, undeterred, filled the silence with a sly observation. “Notice can be a double-edged thing—sometimes it flatters, sometimes it warns, and I’ve learned to trust both instincts.” His words drifted between them, playful yet edged with something more, and Red found herself weighing them even as she pressed onward, her curiosity piqued by the glimmer of truth beneath his wit.
----------------------------------------

As the shadows deepened beneath the canopy, Red’s steps unconsciously slowed, her mind turning over Wolfe’s words and the subtle tension in the air. The path ahead forked, and Wolfe’s confident stride soon outpaced her cautious one. Unbeknownst to Red, their playful exchange had already set in motion a race she did not realize she was running—one in which Wolfe held a secret advantage, and the destination was far more perilous than she imagined.

# Chapter 3: Wolfe Outpaces Red to Grandmother's House

Wolfe glanced back, noting Red's lingering steps as she paused to investigate a cluster of wild strawberries beside the path.

With a sly grin, Wolfe adjusted his forest-green jacket, then slipped off the trail, boots barely rustling the undergrowth.

He darted between twisted birch trunks, dodging brambles and brushing aside low-hanging branches, intent on reaching Grandmother's cottage first.

Red, basket swinging at her side, called after him, 'Race you to Grandmother's door!

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grins mischievously, her red hood fluttering as she darts ahead down the winding forest path, basket bouncing at her side. Red’s eyes sparkled with playful challenge as she spun on her heel, her red hood swirling around her shoulders. With a mischievous grin, she darted ahead down the winding forest path, the basket bouncing at her side. Over her shoulder, she called out, laughter threading through her voice, “Bet you can’t beat me to Grandmother’s door!”
' but her playful challenge faded as Wolfe vanished from view, his laughter echoing through the trees.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to prove herself, Red quickened her pace, crunching twigs beneath her boots and brushing her hand along the damp bark.

Wolfe, motivated by his scheme and the thrill of the chase, vaulted over a fallen log, planning his next move as the distant scent of Grandmother's baking drifted on the breeze.

----------------------------------------

Unaware of Wolfe’s clever trick, Red finally gathered her bouquet and hurried on, eager to see her grandmother and share the adventure of her walk. Meanwhile, inside the cozy cottage, Wolfe—now disguised and ready—waited with anticipation for Red’s arrival, the stage set for unexpected developments. As Red approached the familiar door, a strange sense of excitement mingled with uncertainty, hinting that her visit would be unlike any before.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Invitation

Red stood at the table, slicing crusty bread with careful hands, crumbs scattering across the board.

Her mother crossed the room, folding a clean cloth and tucking it into a woven basket already filled with small jars of preserves and a wedge of cheese.

She paused, watching Red tuck a lock of hair beneath her red hood, and spoke in a firm, protective tone: 'Remember what I told you—these woods can be full of mischief this time of year.

You must keep your wits about you and not stray from the path, no matter what you hear or see.

Red's MotherShe gently places a firm hand on Red's shoulder, her eyes filled with concern. Red’s mother rested a gentle but unwavering hand on her daughter’s shoulder, her gaze shadowed by worry as she searched Red’s face. “Remember what I told you,” she murmured, her voice low and earnest, the words woven with both love and caution. “These woods can be full of mischief this time of year.” She squeezed Red’s shoulder just a little tighter, as if to anchor her in place. “You must keep your wits about you, and no matter what you hear or see, do not stray from the path.”
Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, searching her eyes for agreement. Red’s mother rested her hands gently on her daughter’s shoulders, her gaze intent and searching as if she could will her caution into Red’s very bones. “And if anything feels wrong, you come straight home—promise me, Red.” Her voice was soft but edged with worry, the kind that comes from years of watching the woods shift with the seasons and knowing just how much mischief could be hiding between the trees.
' Red's mother pressed further, concern etched on her face.

'And if anything feels wrong, you come straight home—promise me, Red.

' Red glanced up, her eyes lingering on the sunlit trees beyond the window, and nodded, the determination in her grip as she hefted the basket and slid her feet into sturdy boots beside the door.

Her mother placed a steady hand on her shoulder, guiding her gaze to meet her own, before Red stepped out onto the mossy threshold.

The door closed softly behind her, the scent of hearth smoke trailing in her wake.

----------------------------------------

As Red made her way down the garden path, the rush of anticipation mingled with the quiet warnings echoing in her mind. The gentle morning air belied the uncertainty that stirred in her chest, each step drawing her deeper into the woods and closer to the secrets her grandmother held. Unbeknownst to Red, the invitation would soon reveal more than a simple family visit—it would unravel a scheme that might change the course of her journey forever.

# Chapter 5: Grandmother Reveals Her Matchmaking Scheme

Grandmother settles into her rocking chair and gestures for Red to join her at the table.

Before sharing any letters or matchmaking intentions, Grandmother adopts a more serious tone, warning Red about the dangers in the woods and the importance of trusting her instincts.

She shares a cautionary rhyme and speaks cryptically about unseen threats, subtly alluding to Wolfe but not naming him outright.

After this, Grandmother shifts to a lighter mood, admitting she orchestrated Wolfe's visits in hopes of encouraging Red's happiness, and openly discusses her matchmaking schemes.

However, she also introduces the idea of Red meeting Henry, Mrs.

Grandmother glances at the window nervously, her fingers tightening around Red's hand as she pulls her a little closer. Grandmother’s gaze darted anxiously toward the misted window, her fingers tightening around Red’s hand and tugging her a little closer, as if shielding her from something unseen beyond the glass. She leaned forward, her tone dropping to a conspiratorial whisper, and Red could feel the warmth and gravity of her attention. “Red, listen to me closely—there are things in these woods no one talks about. Not every path you walk is what it seems.” The words hung between them, woven with the weight of old secrets and a mischievous glint in Grandmother’s eye, as if she delighted in sharing a puzzle that only the cleverest could hope to solve.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red pauses, her finger hovering above the page, eyes searching Grandmother's face for answers. Red paused, her finger hovering above the page, uncertainty flickering in her eyes as she searched her grandmother’s face for any sign of reassurance. The room felt suddenly smaller, shadows gathering in the corners as Grandmother leaned in, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial hush. Red’s curiosity, never far from the surface, edged into concern. “What do you mean, Grandmother?” she asked, her words colored by a mix of youthful naïveté and genuine worry. “Is there something out there I should be afraid of?”
Grandmother glances nervously at the window, her hands trembling as she clutches Red's sleeve. Grandmother’s fingers tightened around Red’s sleeve, her knuckles pale with the effort, as she glanced nervously toward the window. The candlelight flickered across her wise, weathered face, illuminating the mischievous glint in her eyes even as unease crept into her voice. Leaning closer, she let her words slip out in a low, conspiratorial murmur. “There are shadows that move when they shouldn’t, Red, and not all wolves wear fur.” Her gaze lingered on the darkness beyond the glass, as if she could see the secrets shifting in the night, and a small, supportive smile played at her lips—half warning, half invitation to look a little deeper.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's fingers tighten around the edge of the blanket, her eyes searching Grandmother's face for answers. Red’s fingers tightened around the edge of the worn blanket, the familiar weave offering small comfort as uncertainty prickled at her thoughts. Her eyes searched Grandmother’s face, tracing every wrinkle for some hint of wisdom or reassurance. She hesitated, her curiosity and caution warring within her, before finally voicing the question that had been lingering in her mind. 

“If I find myself with something—or someone—that feels wrong,” she asked, her voice barely above a whisper, “what should I do?”
Grandmother squeezes Red's hand, her gaze intense and unwavering, as if willing her warning deep into Red's memory. Grandmother’s fingers, warm and sure, closed gently around Red’s hand. Her gaze, sharp as ever, held Red captive—eyes twinkling with mischief and concern in equal measure. She leaned in, lowering her voice to a near-whisper, as if imparting a secret meant for Red alone. “Trust your instincts, Red,” she urged, her tone threaded with both gravity and a hint of playfulness. “And remember the rhyme I taught you: ‘If eyes gleam in daylight, take the longer way.’” The words hung between them, an old magic Grandmother willed into Red’s memory, her grip tightening just enough to anchor the lesson there.
Oakley's grandson, suggesting an openness to multiple suitors and a desire for Red to choose wisely.

Grandmother settles into her rocking chair, eyes twinkling with mischief and affection, awaiting Red's response. Grandmother eased herself into her favorite rocking chair, the well-worn cushions sighing beneath her weight. She folded her hands in her lap, her eyes sparkling with a familiar blend of mischief and affection as she watched Red. With a gentle chuckle, she confessed, “I suppose it’s time I let you in on my little secret.” The chair creaked as she leaned closer, voice warm. “I didn’t truly need help with the firewood, dear. I invited Wolfe here because I’ve seen the way you two look at each other—and honestly, it warms my old heart more than any blazing hearth ever could.” She paused, her gaze fond and knowing. “I’ve watched your friendship blossom from the edge of the forest, and nothing delights me more than seeing you happy.”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's cheeks flush with surprise and a shy smile as she glances between Grandmother and Wolfe, her hands twisting nervously in her apron. Red’s cheeks flushed a vivid pink, and a shy, uncertain smile flickered across her lips. She glanced between Grandmother—who sat serenely by the hearth—and Wolfe, whose eyes met hers with a glimmer of surprise. Her hands twisted nervously in the folds of her apron as she tried to find her composure. The truth hung in the air, bright and trembling. “Grandmother, you knew all along—and you wanted us to spend time together?” The question tumbled out, half-wonder, half-accusation, carried on the current of her curiosity and disbelief.
Grandmother reaches over to gently squeeze Red's hand, her eyes twinkling with warmth and mischief. Grandmother reached over and gently squeezed Red’s hand, her fingers warm and steady. Her eyes, always sharp and full of secrets, now sparkled with both affection and a hint of mischief. “Of course, darling,” she said, her voice low and full of humor. “I hoped that by giving you both a little nudge, you’d find the courage to let your hearts speak freely.” As she spoke, her gaze lingered on Red, both loving and just a touch conspiratorial, as if she took great delight in her own matchmaking scheme.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red blushes, glancing shyly at Wolfe, a grateful smile tugging at her lips. Red felt the warmth rising to her cheeks as she glanced shyly at Wolfe, a grateful smile tugging at her lips despite herself. She turned to her grandmother, her voice soft but earnest. She admitted, almost in a whisper, that she had never imagined Grandmother could be so clever—or so kind. Red’s gaze lingered, a spark of wonder in her eyes, as she added that she supposed she ought to thank her for believing in them before they even dared to believe in themselves.
Red expresses surprise at her grandmother's meddling but is also touched by her care and concern.

Grandmother gently pours more tea into Red's cup, her lips curling into a mischievous smile as she watches Red's reaction, her tone playful but earnest. Grandmother’s hands moved with practiced grace as she refilled Red’s teacup, the gentle clink of porcelain punctuating the quiet afternoon. Her eyes sparkled with a knowing mischief, lips curling into a smile that threatened to break into laughter at any moment. “You know, darling,” she began, her tone light and teasing but underpinned by earnest warmth, “I was chatting with Mrs. Oakley at the market the other day. She mentioned her grandson, Henry—such a fine young man these days. Kind, clever, and apparently he’s taken to baking the most delightful honey cakes.” She paused just long enough for Red to squirm under her gaze, clearly enjoying the effect of her words. “I thought perhaps you might enjoy meeting him, just for tea. What do you think?”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red blushes, stirring her tea with unnecessary vigor, a half-smile tugging at her lips. Red blushed, her cheeks blooming as she stirred her tea with a bit too much energy, the spoon clinking against porcelain in time with her thoughts. A half-smile played at her lips, betraying both amusement and embarrassment. “Oh, Gran,” she ventured, her tone teasing yet earnest, “you do love a good honey cake almost as much as a good match—I hardly know Henry at all!” The words tumbled out as Grandmother’s hands moved with practiced grace, refilling Red’s cup and watching her over the rim with eyes that sparkled with secret mischief.
Grandmother gives Red a knowing wink, her hands deftly rearranging the tea tray to make room for another cup. Grandmother gave Red a knowing wink, her fingers deftly nudging the honey cake plate aside to clear a spot for an extra cup. As she topped off Red’s tea, her eyes sparkled with mischief and warmth. “That’s exactly why, my dear,” she said with a gentle smile, “an afternoon spent cozying up over tea and honey cake is the perfect way to get acquainted.” Her words floated in the air, sweet and inviting, as she slid the freshly poured cup across the table—her orchestrations as subtle as the scent of wildflowers drifting in from the open window.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red gives her grandmother a teasing smile, stirring her tea while trying to hide a faint blush. Red gave her grandmother a teasing smile as she stirred her tea, trying to hide the faint blush coloring her cheeks. She watched Gran’s hands busily refilling her cup, noting the familiar twinkle in the older woman’s eyes. “You know I can never say no when you look at me like that,” Red admitted, her tone playful but edged with curiosity. Still, she couldn’t help but add, lowering her voice conspiratorially, “I just hope this isn’t another excuse for honey cakes—or matchmaking schemes.”
Grandmother pats Red's hand gently, her grin widening as she nudges the plate of honey cakes a little closer. Grandmother’s hands moved with practiced ease as she refilled Red’s teacup, her fingers lingering for a moment in a gentle pat atop Red’s own. Her grin widened, all mischief and warmth, as she nudged the plate of honey cakes just a little closer—temptation within easy reach. “Sweetheart,” she began, her voice threaded with humor and affection, “I simply want to see you happy.” Her eyes sparkled knowingly as she settled back, gaze flicking toward the cottage door, as if expecting Wolfe to appear at any moment. “And if a clever boy with a warm smile and a knack for baking happens to help with that, well—who am I to stand in fate’s way?”
The conversation then explores Red's doubts about Wolfe, with Grandmother acknowledging both Wolfe’s gentle actions and the lingering air of mystery and potential danger she senses in him.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hesitantly traces the rim of her cup, her brow furrowed with concern as she looks up at Grandmother, searching for answers. Red sat cross-legged at the edge of her grandmother’s bed, absently tracing the embroidery on her red cloak. Her eyes, bright with curiosity, flicked up to meet her grandmother’s. "Grandmother," she began, her voice a gentle mix of concern and wonder, "do you really think Wolfe is as dangerous as everyone says?" She hesitated, chewing thoughtfully on the inside of her cheek. "He always seemed... different, but not exactly cruel." Red glanced toward the window, as if hoping to catch a glimpse of the forest’s edge. "Have you ever seen another side to him?" she asked quietly, her tone threaded with both naïveté and a courageous desire to understand.
Grandmother sets her teacup down softly, her gaze distant as if recalling memories both fond and unsettling. Grandmother set her teacup down with a gentle clink, her gaze drifting beyond the cottage walls as if sifting through memories both tender and troubling. She gave Red a sidelong glance, the corners of her lips twitching with that familiar hint of mischief, and spoke softly, almost as if relaying a secret to the steam swirling above her cup. Sometimes, she mused, those who seem most fearsome are simply misunderstood. Yet with Wolfe, even in his gentlest moments, she had sensed something else—a shadow lingering just behind his smile, elusive but unmistakable.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hesitated, her voice barely above a whisper as she watched the steam curl from her cup. Red hesitated, her fingers tracing the rim of her cup as she watched the steam curl upward, fading into the lamplight. The question pressed at her chest, uneasy and persistent, and when she finally spoke, her voice barely rose above the gentle hush of the cottage. "How can we ever tell," she wondered aloud, eyes searching her grandmother's weathered face, "if the shadow is only our fear... or if it’s something darker, waiting for the right moment to show itself?"
Grandmother gazes out the window, her fingers tightening around the teacup as a distant memory flickers in her eyes. Grandmother gazed out the window, her fingers tightening around the teacup as if anchoring herself to a memory only she could see. The gentle hush of the cottage seemed to settle around them, punctuated only by the song of distant birds. Red, still surprised by the turn in their conversation, traced the rim of her own cup, her eyes flickering with curiosity and doubt as she questioned her grandmother about Wolfe’s true character.

A slow, knowing smile spread across Grandmother’s face. “We learn much in the quiet spaces between words, Red,” she said, her voice warm with mischief and wisdom. “And sometimes the truest nature of a heart is revealed only when it believes no one is watching.” She glanced sidelong at Red, her eyes twinkling with the satisfaction of someone who had long mastered the art of observation, her tone soft but laced with a gentle nudge, as if encouraging Red to look beyond what was merely spoken aloud.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, her voice barely above a whisper, eyes searching Grandmother's face for hints of truth. Red leaned in, her elbows pressing into the worn wood of the table, the chipped rim of her teacup circling beneath her fingertip. Her curiosity was palpable, an eager wisp in the hush between them. With her eyes searching Grandmother’s face for some flicker of truth, she let her question slip into the quiet, her voice barely more than a breath: “Have you ever seen Wolfe when he thought you weren’t looking, Grandmother—did his shadow ever slip?”
Grandmother's hands tremble slightly as she sets her cup down, her gaze distant as if recalling the memory in vivid detail. Grandmother’s hands trembled just slightly as she set her cup down, the porcelain clinking softly against the saucer. Her gaze drifted past Red, out the window where dusk gathered at the edge of the woods, and for a moment she seemed far away, sifting through memories. “There was a night,” she began, voice edged with a wistful humor, “when I caught Wolfe staring into the fire. His eyes—oh, child, they were so full of longing and loss that I almost forgot to be afraid of him.” She glanced sidelong at Red, a small, knowing smile tugging at the corners of her mouth, as if the memory played out before her anew.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's voice is barely above a whisper as she draws her knees to her chest, watching Grandmother's face for any flicker of doubt or sympathy. Red’s voice was scarcely more than a whisper as she drew her knees up to her chest, her fingers tracing anxious circles along the rim of her cup. Watching Grandmother’s expression with searching eyes, she asked, “Did it make you feel sorry for him, or more wary?” The question slipped out quietly, edged with curiosity and the faintest tremor of uncertainty, as if she wasn’t sure which answer would bring her more comfort.
Grandmother wraps her shawl tighter around her shoulders, her gaze distant as she recalls the memory. Grandmother wrapped her shawl tighter around her shoulders, the movement slow and thoughtful, as if warding off not just the night’s chill but memories too. Her eyes drifted to the window, clouded with distance, and Red saw the familiar glimmer of wisdom and mischief mingling there. “It made me ache for the boy he must have been,” she murmured, voice quiet but steady, as if confiding a secret to the shadows beyond the cottage walls. Still, she added with a small, knowing smile that curled at the corner of her mouth, “I kept the door locked just the same.”
Grandmother offers specific reassurances by recounting Wolfe's sincere gestures, but also admits to keeping her guard up, showing a nuanced perspective.

Grandmother sits by the hearth, her voice gentle as she gestures toward the vase of wildflowers on the windowsill. Grandmother sat by the hearth, her hands folded contentedly in her lap, eyes twinkling with a familiar mischief. She gestured toward the vase of wildflowers perched on the windowsill—a splash of color against the soft gray light outside. “Red, I know you worry,” she began, her tone gentle, but edged with the certainty of someone who had watched and understood much in her years. “I’ve kept a close eye on Wolfe, you know. Just last week, he was out there chopping wood in the pouring rain, soaked to the bone but stubborn as ever, determined that we’d stay warm.” She smiled, recalling the scene with fond amusement. “Every so often, he’d stop and peer back to make sure the door was latched—just so I wouldn’t catch a draft.” Her gaze drifted to the wildflowers—violet, gold, and white, carefully arranged. “And those?” She nodded to the vase. “Wolfe picked the prettiest ones from the forest himself and brought them in, just to brighten things up.” Grandmother’s voice softened, as if sharing a secret. “Little gestures like these, dear, they tell me he’s sincere.”
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red fidgets with her cloak, her brow furrowed with uncertainty as she glances between the wildflowers and Grandmother. Red’s fingers twisted nervously at the edge of her crimson cloak, uncertainty flickering across her face as she glanced back and forth between the tangled wildflowers at her feet and her grandmother’s steady gaze. “But Grandmother,” she began, her voice edged with both curiosity and concern, “what if he’s just doing those things to make himself look good?” The question lingered in the air as she searched her grandmother’s face for reassurance. “How do you know it’s not all an act?”
Grandmother folds her hands gently in her lap and looks at Red with a soft, reassuring smile. Grandmother folded her hands gently in her lap, her eyes twinkling with a mixture of warmth and mischief as she regarded Red. That soft, reassuring smile she wore seemed to hold a secret or two. “Oh, Red,” she began, her voice carrying the weight of wisdom and a hint of amusement, “I know why you’re careful. But I’ve watched him when he thought no one else was looking.” She leaned in a little, lowering her voice as if sharing a treasured memory. “Remember that morning it was raining so hard? Wolfe was out there chopping wood before sunrise, determined to keep us warm. And there was that time he crept through the hallway at dawn to mend the loose floorboard, believing I was still asleep.” Grandmother’s gaze lingered on Red, gentle and encouraging, as if to say she’d seen the quiet kindness others missed.
Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red bites her lip, glancing at the wildflowers as she waits for Grandmother's answer. Red traced the frayed edge of her grandmother’s quilt, her fingers absently following the swirling pattern as she spoke, her voice tinged with a mixture of doubt and hope. “I guess,” she murmured, glancing up with those searching eyes of hers. But curiosity tugged at her, as it always did, and she pressed on, her words gentle but insistent. “Did he ever say anything to you, Grandmother—something that made you feel he truly cared, not just showed it?”
Grandmother gently places her hand over Red's, her voice soft and reassuring. With a gentle touch, Grandmother placed her hand over Red’s, her eyes sparkling with a familiar mischief. “He did, dear,” she began, her voice warm and soothing, weaving memory into the hush of the cottage. “One evening, when my joints ached and the rain drummed against the panes, he quietly asked which tea eased the pain and brewed it for me. He set the cup by my elbow and said, ‘I want you comfortable, always.’” Grandmother’s lips curled into a knowing smile, her gaze drifting to the window as if Wolfe might appear there at any moment, the memory lingering between them like the steam rising from a freshly poured cup.
The chapter ends with Red deeply considering both her grandmother’s warnings and hopes, the wind rattling the shutters, and the firelight flickering as Red weighs her feelings about Wolfe and her future.

----------------------------------------

As the last echoes of her grandmother’s words linger in the quiet room, Red senses the weight of new possibilities settling around her. The night air hums with anticipation, and with every shifting shadow, she feels the boundaries of her old life giving way to something uncertain but hopeful. As dawn approaches, Red finds her thoughts turning inevitably toward Wolfe, and to the choice that now lies before them both.

# Chapter 6: Red and Wolfe Choose Each Other

Inside the cottage, Grandmother stirs a pot of fragrant stew, her spectacles glinting in the golden light.

She hums a lively tune, pausing to peer out the window and watch Red and Wolfe disappear along the path.

Red's Mother, standing beside her, wipes her hands on her apron and frowns, eyes lingering on the pair.

Grandmother nudges her gently with her elbow and says, "Let the woods test them—she chose her path.

" Red's Mother sighs, then moves to set a loaf of bread on the windowsill, her gaze softening.

Together, they set the table, the clatter of dishes and the aroma of fresh herbs filling the cozy cottage.

Grandmother gently sets a floral-patterned plate on the table, her eyes crinkling with a fond smile as she glances at Red's Mother, the scent of thyme and rosemary drifting through the warm kitchen. Grandmother set a floral-patterned plate on the table, her movements as gentle as the fond smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes. The kitchen, warm and fragrant with thyme and rosemary, echoed softly with the clatter of dishes as she glanced sidelong at Red's Mother. “Careful with those plates, dear,” she murmured with playful mischief, her tone light. “Your grandfather always claimed a chipped dish brought a lucky day, but I’d rather not put that to the test tonight.” As she arranged the silverware, her gaze softened, drifting somewhere beyond the kitchen walls. “Do you remember how he used to whistle while we cooked?” she asked, her voice threaded with affection and memory. For a moment, she paused, eyes half-closed, as if the distant tune might float in on the steam of the evening’s supper. “I can almost hear him now, if I close my eyes.”
Red's MotherI brush a stray curl from Red's forehead and pass her the napkins, my eyes soft with the memory. As I brushed a stray curl from Red’s forehead and passed her the napkins, my gaze lingered for a moment, softened by memory. The clatter of dishes and the warm scent of fresh herbs filled our kitchen, but my thoughts drifted to evenings long past. “He always said his whistling made the soup taste brighter,” I murmured, almost to myself, recalling the gentle tune that used to weave through our home. Deep down, I suspected it was less about the soup and more about keeping smiles on our faces, a quiet magic meant to shield us from worries lurking just beyond our little cottage.
Grandmother gives Red's mother a warm, conspiratorial wink as she sets a sprig of rosemary on the table and smooths the cloth with gentle, practiced hands. Grandmother laid a sprig of rosemary on the table, her fingers moving with the ease of countless meals prepared for loved ones. As she smoothed the cloth, she glanced at Red’s mother and offered a warm, conspiratorial wink—a silent signal between co-conspirators in the gentle art of matchmaking. The clatter of dishes mingled with the sharp, earthy scent of herbs, filling the cozy cottage with the promise of a meal made with care. “Perhaps we ought to hum a little tune ourselves,” she suggested, her voice lilting with mischief and wisdom. “After all, happiness is the best seasoning, isn’t it?”
Red's MotherI brush a stray curl from Red’s forehead, smiling as she arranges the spoons with careful concentration. Red’s mother reached over, gently brushing a stray curl from her daughter’s forehead. She watched as Red arranged the spoons with careful concentration, the clatter of dishes mingling with the warm aroma of fresh herbs that filled the cozy cottage. Smiling softly, she remarked that with her daughter and grandmother both bustling in the kitchen, together they were making the happiest stew the cottage had ever known. Her voice carried a quiet pride, tinged with the certainty that nothing could bring more joy to their humble home than this shared moment.
Grandmother ladles stew into bowls, her contented smile betraying her satisfaction at orchestrating the match.

GrandmotherShe ladles generous portions of stew into each bowl, her eyes twinkling as she glances knowingly at the empty seats set side by side at the table. Grandmother ladled generous portions of stew into each bowl, her hands steady and practiced, the rich aroma curling into the cozy air of her cottage. As she set the steaming bowls down, her eyes drifted to the two empty seats, placed side by side at the table with deliberate care. Her contented smile grew, a glimmer of mischief lighting her gaze. “There now,” she murmured, voice warm and knowing, “nothing brings people together like a hearty meal—and a little nudge in the right direction, if you ask me.” The words hung in the air, flavored with her quiet satisfaction at the scene she’d so carefully arranged, the promise of connection simmering just beneath the surface.
Red's Mother, still watchful, finally nods in acceptance, her hands steady as she arranges cutlery, preparing to welcome the returning pair.

Red's MotherShe smooths the tablecloth one final time, glancing toward the door with a mix of apprehension and hope. Red’s mother smoothed the tablecloth one last time, her fingers lingering at the edges as she glanced toward the door—apprehension flickering in her eyes, though hope tried to settle in its place. The table was set, each piece of cutlery arranged with steady hands, as if order could summon calm to the household. She drew a quiet breath, acceptance settling over her features. Hearts needed mending just as much as wounds, she reflected, and while her worries hadn’t vanished, the desire for peace in the house outweighed them tonight. With a gentle nod, she resolved to welcome their guests properly and let tomorrow unfold as it would.

As dusk settled over the cottage and laughter mingled with the drifting scent of rosemary, hope and love found their place at the table, promising warmth for all the days to come.
