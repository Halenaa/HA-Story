She paused, noticing muddy footprints trailing across the porch and a faint, unfamiliar whistle coming from inside. Driven by curiosity and concern for her grandmother, Red knocked twice, then pushed open the door, her boots scraping against the rough boards. Wolfe, standing near the hearth and examining a row of dried herbs, turned with practiced ease, offering a courteous bow. His gaze lingered on Red's cloak as he introduced himself, explaining he was delivering firewood at Grandmother's request. Red narrowed her eyes, glancing at the stacked logs and the half-filled wood basket, then questioned his presence, her tone playful yet guarded. Wolfe answered with a sly smile, inviting her to inspect the basket herself. Their exchange grew brisk: Red circled the room, fingers brushing the cool iron kettle as she searched for signs of Grandmother, while Wolfe stepped aside, gesturing toward the back room. Both maneuvered carefully, intent on uncovering each other's true purpose—Red determined to ensure her grandmother's safety, Wolfe eager to prolong the encounter and win Red's attention.",

Without preamble, Grandmother reached into the basket at her feet and withdrew a folded letter, tapping it thoughtfully before passing it to Red.

As Red scanned the lines, Grandmother leaned forward, her voice low and conspiratorial. She revealed that she had invited Wolfe to the cottage under the guise of needing help with firewood, and confessed she had watched their growing friendship with delight. Grandmother’s hands busied themselves with refilling Red’s teacup, her eyes twinkling as she explained her matchmaking intentions. Red, surprised, traced the rim of her cup and questioned her grandmother about Wolfe’s true character. Grandmother responded by recounting specific moments she had observed—Wolfe chopping wood in the rain, pausing to check the door latch, and bringing fresh wildflowers for the kitchen windowsill—each action carefully chosen to reassure Red of his sincerity. The scene ended with Red considering the letter, her grandmother’s scheme now laid bare, as the wind rattled the cottage shutters and the fire cast long, flickering shadows across the table.",
