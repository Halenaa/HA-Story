# Chapter 4: Red Arrives and Confronts Wolfe

Red, adjusting her hood as she reaches the cottage, notices muddy footprints and an unfamiliar whistle from within.

Her concern for her grandmother heightens.

She knocks, then enters, finding Wolfe by the hearth with a stack of firewood.

Wolfe greets her warmly, explaining he’s there at Grandmother’s request, but Red quickly grows suspicious of his presence—her tone oscillating between playful curiosity and guarded skepticism.

As Wolfe tries to distract her with offers of tea and explanations about the herbs, Red’s unease grows.

Wolfe offers a polite smile, but his eyes linger a touch too long on the bright red cloak, his tone warm yet edged with a curious intensity. "Ah, you must be Red. Your cloak is just as Grandmother described. I'm Wolfe—the one she asked to bring more firewood for her hearth. She worries about the chill settling in these woods. I often help her with such things, you know. It's a long walk for someone as young as you. Are you always alone on this path?" ——Wolfe

She persistently questions Wolfe about Grandmother’s whereabouts and well-being, growing increasingly insistent as Wolfe offers a series of evasions and excuses, attempting to prevent her from entering the back room.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans casually against a log, her arms crossed loosely, a small smile playing at her lips as she watches him over the rim of her hood, eyes sharp and curious. "Well, you’ve been awfully busy out here with the ax, haven’t you? That’s quite a pile for just one morning. Tell me, what brings you so deep into these woods today—just the firewood, or something else on your mind?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Red, perceptive and courageous, refuses to be dissuaded, challenging Wolfe’s motives and arguing her right to see her grandmother.

Wolfe rests his hand lightly atop the basket's lid, his eyes glinting with mischief as he subtly nudges it toward her. "Why spoil the surprise with words when you can see—and maybe even taste—for yourself? Go on, have a look." ——Wolfe

Wolfe, both protective and secretive, finally relents but warns Red to prepare herself.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red traces her fingertips along the kettle, eyes narrowing as she glances at the shadows stretching toward the curtained doorway, her footsteps slow and deliberate. "Grandmother? Your voice sounded so strange when I arrived. Are you sure she’s just resting in the back? It smells different in here." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe moves between Red and the doorway to the back room, his gaze steady but watchful. "Perhaps it’s the herbs I brewed earlier—why don’t you sit and have some tea while you wait?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red moves past Wolfe, her eyes narrowed as she glances toward the shadowy doorway at the back. "Thank you, but I’d rather check on Grandmother myself—she usually greets me right away." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe swiftly moves toward a dusty shelf, blocking Red’s path with a practiced, almost casual step. "I assure you, she’s quite comfortable; the room is a bit dim, let me fetch a lamp before you go in." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red edges closer to the doorway, her eyes darting around the shadowy corners and her grip tightening on the basket. "If she's resting, I can be quiet—I just want to see her for a moment." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe steps between Red and the doorway, hands clasped lightly, blocking her path with a gentle but unmistakable barrier. "Ah, but you wouldn’t want to disturb her dreams; she’s been so weary lately, and sudden noises might startle her." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tiptoes toward the doorway, eyes narrowed, scanning for any movement or sign of her grandmother beyond the dim-lit threshold. "I promise to tread softly—Grandmother always knows when I’m near, even in her sleep." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe steps forward, blocking the narrow doorway to the back room with a subtle shift, his gaze fixed on Red’s movements. "If you insist, perhaps I should accompany you—her eyes have grown sensitive, and she may not recognize you at first." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sharply at Wolfe, her hand hovering over the latch of the back room door, eyes narrowed with mounting suspicion. "I'd rather go alone, thank you—I know Grandmother's ways better than anyone." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe steps neatly between Red and the back room, subtly blocking her path while fussing with a folded shawl draped over a nearby chair. "Then perhaps I should tidy up first—she’d be embarrassed to have you see her so unkempt, you know how particular she is." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, lingering by the doorway to the back room, her hand tightening on her basket as she glances from Wolfe to the shadowed hall. "That’s odd—Grandmother never minds my visits, no matter how she looks." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe blocks the doorway subtly, placing himself between Red and the back room, his eyes flickering uneasily toward the shadows beyond. "Perhaps, but today she insisted—truly, she was most adamant about her privacy." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, edging closer to the threshold, her hand tightening protectively around the basket she carries. "That's unlike her—she usually calls for me the moment she hears my step; why are you standing in the doorway as if to block my way?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe shifts slightly, maintaining his position between Red and the back room, his gaze steady but his grip tightening on the doorframe. "Old habits, I suppose—one grows protective when illness lingers in the house." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, her grip tightening on her basket as she steps closer to Wolfe, refusing to be intimidated. "Protective, or secretive? Because I can’t help but feel you’re hiding something from me." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe shifts his stance subtly, widening his frame across the doorway, eyes flickering to the shadowed back room as if guarding its threshold. "You mistake caution for secrecy, child—my only wish is to spare you any distress." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes narrowing as she edges closer to the door, her posture tense and ready. "If you truly wish to spare me distress, then let me see for myself that Grandmother is safe." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe steps aside at last, lingering in the shadowed doorway, eyes fixed on Red with a measured, unreadable expression. "Very well, but do prepare yourself—she may not appear as you remember." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red fixes Wolfe with a steady, defiant stare, her hand tightening on the basket as she edges closer to the doorway. "Whatever I find, I’d rather face it than stand here guessing—please, step aside." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

The chapter ends with Red demanding to see her grandmother, determined to face the truth for herself.

----------------------------------------

As the echo of Red’s determination still lingered in the quiet house, a sudden shift in the air signaled that her journey was far from over. Stepping out from the tense confrontation with Wolfe, Red found herself drawn toward the edge of the woods, where an unfamiliar presence awaited—one that would challenge everything she thought she knew about strangers and trust.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Charming Stranger

Red adjusted her red cloak as she trod the uneven path, balancing a wicker basket filled with fresh bread and wildflowers.

She paused to inspect a cluster of mushrooms, brushing her fingers across their velvety caps, when a sharp snap of a twig made her lift her head.

Wolfe emerged from behind a thicket, brushing leaves from his sleeve and offering a playful bow.

Their conversation quickly deepened into a playful yet cautious verbal dance—Red, perceptive and courageous, questioned Wolfe's motives and presence in the woods, showing a mix of curiosity and wariness.

Wolfe leans in, nostrils flaring with appreciation, eyes glinting with curiosity as he circles Red at a polite distance, keenly observing the basket and cloak. "Well now, what a striking shade you wear! That cloak could wake the whole forest from its slumber. And is it my nose deceiving me, or does your basket hold a feast fit for a king? Tell me, Red, where does a young traveler like you find such splendid scents and colors?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her basket invitingly, her eyes cautious but curious as she watches Wolfe's reaction. "Thank you, sir; the cloak was my grandmother's gift, and the bread inside is still warm from her oven—would you like to smell for yourself?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe leans in slightly, inhaling the warm aroma from the basket, his eyes glinting with eager curiosity as he matches Red's pace along the path. "Ah, your grandmother must be a marvel; I confess, the scent alone is enough to set my stomach rumbling—may I walk a little way with you and hear more of these home-baked wonders?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red lifts the basket slightly toward Wolfe, her eyes bright with curiosity but her grip firm, as she steps forward along the winding trail. "If you promise not to gobble up all my stories at once, I'd welcome the company—it's a lonely path through these woods." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe steps lightly beside Red, his gaze flickering from the basket to the swirling red of her cloak, as if trying to memorize every detail. "I promise to savor each tale as slowly as I would a warm loaf—besides, I've always believed the woods reveal their secrets only to those who walk them in good company." ——Wolfe

Wolfe responded with wit and hints of mystery, never fully revealing his intentions but matching Red’s guarded openness with his own.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grips her basket tighter, eyes never leaving Wolfe, her voice polite but edged with wariness as she steps lightly to the side, keeping some distance between them. "Excuse me, sir… I couldn't help but notice you watching the path. Are you lost out here, or just wandering for the view? Not many strangers travel this deep into the woods." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe offers a thin, unreadable smile, his gaze lingering on Red just a moment too long before drifting back to the shadows between the trees. "A little of both, perhaps—these woods have a way of drawing in those with questions and keeping their answers well hidden, don't you think?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket and takes a half-step back, watching Wolfe's eyes for any flicker of intent. "Maybe, but the woods also have a way of showing people exactly what they're looking for—even if they didn't know it when they wandered in." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

WolfeRed shifts her basket to her other arm, her eyes never leaving Wolfe as she subtly steps sideways, keeping a safe distance yet not breaking the conversation. "And what is it you hope to find, sir—answers or something else?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket closer, subtly stepping back to gauge Wolfe's reaction, her gaze never leaving his face. "I'm hoping to find my grandmother's cottage, but I keep a careful eye out for anything unexpected—especially those who linger where few dare tread." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe tilts his head, a faint glint in his eye as he steps just slightly closer, the dappled sunlight barely touching his shadowed face. "Curiosity can be a dangerous lantern in the dark, especially when it draws you toward places best left undisturbed." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze steady but wary as she takes a cautious step closer to Wolfe. "Sometimes the only way to know is to ask, even if the answers aren't what you hoped for." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

WolfeRed tightens her grip on her basket, her gaze steady but wary as she takes a small step back, keeping distance between herself and Wolfe. "If you're only wandering, then you won't mind telling me what brings you this far from the main road." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red steps just out of Wolfe's reach, eyes narrowing as she studies his expression for any sign of deceit. "I could ask you the same, but it's usually the ones with nothing to hide who answer first." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe tilts his head, a faint, unreadable smile flickering as his gaze lingers on Red, measuring her reaction. "Perhaps it's the thrill of crossing paths with someone who asks all the right questions, or maybe I'm simply drawn to secrets others would rather keep hidden." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, narrowing her eyes as she studies Wolfe's face for any flicker of true intent. "Secrets have a way of biting back if you prod them too hard—so tell me, are you searching for something you lost, or just hoping to find someone who won't notice you following their trail?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe's gaze lingers a fraction too long on Red's basket, a faint, unreadable smile flickering at the edge of his mouth as he shifts his weight, blending almost seamlessly into the shadow of a twisted tree. "Some trails are worth following, even if they're not meant for every set of footprints—wouldn't you agree?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, shifting her basket to her other arm and glancing down the path to gauge just how alone they truly are. "I suppose that depends on whether the footsteps behind you mean trouble, or if they're just as lost as you claim to be." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe's gaze lingers on Red, his smile unreadable, as he takes a slow step closer, the leaves crunching beneath his feet. "Trouble rarely announces itself—sometimes it prefers to walk quietly alongside until the right moment arrives." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grips the basket tighter, her eyes narrowing as she studies Wolfe's posture for any sign of threat. "And sometimes, the quiet ones are the most dangerous, especially when they know these woods better than anyone else." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe's gaze lingers on Red, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes as he takes a slow step closer, blending shadow and smile. "Then perhaps it's best we both keep our eyes open—for the woods can turn on friend or foe without warning." ——Wolfe

The two exchanged stories, questions, and philosophical musings about the secrets of the forest, each subtly probing the other's intentions.

Their banter grew layered, blending charm with suspicion, as both acknowledged the potential dangers of trust and the allure of hidden places.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, a mischievous spark in her eyes as she steps lightly over a fallen branch, her red cloak brushing the undergrowth. She keeps her gaze steady on Wolfe, inviting him to share while keeping her own secrets close. "You know, Wolfe, I always thought the forest belonged to the trees and the shadows, but lately, I wonder if it belongs to its secrets instead. There’s a place I go when I don’t want to be found—where the moss grows so thick, it muffles even your footsteps. Do you have a favorite spot, or do you prefer to keep moving, never leaving a trace?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe circles closer, eyes glinting with curiosity, as if weighing whether to share more or lure Red deeper into conversation. "Ah, Red, I have a nook where the brambles knot so tightly only the sly or the desperate dare squeeze through—it's where I listen to the wind gossip, though I suspect the forest keeps a few secrets even from me." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, a sly smile playing at her lips as she circles a tree, eyes never leaving Wolfe. "Maybe the forest likes to keep us guessing, Wolfe—do you ever wonder what it hides from even those who think they know it best?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe circles a little closer, eyes glinting with curiosity and the hint of a challenge, as if inviting Red to share a secret of her own. "Only every time the moonlight flickers just so, making me question whether I’m the hunter or simply another story whispered through the leaves." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, her eyes glinting with curiosity and caution, as if daring Wolfe to share more. "Perhaps we're both just stories the forest tells to itself, hoping we never quite unravel its last secret." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

By the time Red resumed her walk, Wolfe fell in step beside her, their rapport marked by mutual intrigue, a shared sense of caution, and the beginnings of trust amid the uncertainty of the woods.

Wolfe matches Red’s pace, glancing upward with a sly smile, his tone teasing yet inviting as he gestures toward the sky. "You know, Red, if clouds could gossip, I suspect they'd have plenty to say about strangers sharing woodland paths. I wonder what they'd make of us." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances at Wolfe with a sidelong smile, her basket swinging lightly at her side. "Perhaps they'd wonder which of us is the stranger, and which the story worth telling." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe glances upward, then back at Red with a half-smile, matching his pace to hers as the path narrows beneath the dappled sunlight. "Ah, but sometimes the best stories begin with uncertain introductions—perhaps the tales spun above are already weaving us together in ways neither of us expect." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances upward, a small smile playing at her lips as she tucks a stray lock of hair behind her ear, her steps measured but unhurried. "Then let's hope the clouds are gentle narrators, for I've never liked stories that turn dark too quickly." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe glances sideways with a sly smile, matching his measured pace to hers, letting the silence stretch just enough to invite her next thought. "I assure you, Red, I much prefer sunshine—though a hint of shadow does make the light more interesting." ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Wolfe, her basket swinging lightly at her side, measuring his reaction with a half-smile. "Interesting light draws curious eyes, but I suppose you don't mind being watched, Wolfe?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Wolfe flashes a sly grin, matching her pace as he glances sideways, inviting Red’s gaze to linger just a moment longer. "Not at all—after all, what’s the point of a striking silhouette if not to be noticed?" ——Wolfe

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Wolfe, her fingers tightening slightly around the basket’s handle as she steps just a bit further from the path’s edge. "Notice can be a double-edged thing—sometimes it flatters, sometimes it warns, and I’ve learned to trust both instincts." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

----------------------------------------

As the shadows deepened beneath the canopy, Red’s steps unconsciously slowed, her mind turning over Wolfe’s words and the subtle tension in the air. The path ahead forked, and Wolfe’s confident stride soon outpaced her cautious one. Unbeknownst to Red, their playful exchange had already set in motion a race she did not realize she was running—one in which Wolfe held a secret advantage, and the destination was far more perilous than she imagined.

# Chapter 3: Wolfe Outpaces Red to Grandmother's House

Wolfe glanced back, noting Red's lingering steps as she paused to investigate a cluster of wild strawberries beside the path.

With a sly grin, Wolfe adjusted his forest-green jacket, then slipped off the trail, boots barely rustling the undergrowth.

He darted between twisted birch trunks, dodging brambles and brushing aside low-hanging branches, intent on reaching Grandmother's cottage first.

Red, basket swinging at her side, called after him, 'Race you to Grandmother's door!

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red grins mischievously, her red hood fluttering as she darts ahead down the winding forest path, basket bouncing at her side. "Bet you can't beat me to Grandmother's door!" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

' but her playful challenge faded as Wolfe vanished from view, his laughter echoing through the trees.

Driven by curiosity and a desire to prove herself, Red quickened her pace, crunching twigs beneath her boots and brushing her hand along the damp bark.

Wolfe, motivated by his scheme and the thrill of the chase, vaulted over a fallen log, planning his next move as the distant scent of Grandmother's baking drifted on the breeze.

----------------------------------------

Unaware of Wolfe’s clever trick, Red finally gathered her bouquet and hurried on, eager to see her grandmother and share the adventure of her walk. Meanwhile, inside the cozy cottage, Wolfe—now disguised and ready—waited with anticipation for Red’s arrival, the stage set for unexpected developments. As Red approached the familiar door, a strange sense of excitement mingled with uncertainty, hinting that her visit would be unlike any before.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Invitation

Red stood at the table, slicing crusty bread with careful hands, crumbs scattering across the board.

Her mother crossed the room, folding a clean cloth and tucking it into a woven basket already filled with small jars of preserves and a wedge of cheese.

She paused, watching Red tuck a lock of hair beneath her red hood, and spoke in a firm, protective tone: 'Remember what I told you—these woods can be full of mischief this time of year.

You must keep your wits about you and not stray from the path, no matter what you hear or see.

Red's MotherShe gently places a firm hand on Red's shoulder, her eyes filled with concern. "Red, remember what I told you—these woods can be full of mischief this time of year. You must keep your wits about you and not stray from the path, no matter what you hear or see." ——Red's Mother

Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, searching her eyes for agreement. "And if anything feels wrong, you come straight home—promise me, Red." ——Red's Mother

' Red's mother pressed further, concern etched on her face.

'And if anything feels wrong, you come straight home—promise me, Red.

' Red glanced up, her eyes lingering on the sunlit trees beyond the window, and nodded, the determination in her grip as she hefted the basket and slid her feet into sturdy boots beside the door.

Her mother placed a steady hand on her shoulder, guiding her gaze to meet her own, before Red stepped out onto the mossy threshold.

The door closed softly behind her, the scent of hearth smoke trailing in her wake.

----------------------------------------

As Red made her way down the garden path, the rush of anticipation mingled with the quiet warnings echoing in her mind. The gentle morning air belied the uncertainty that stirred in her chest, each step drawing her deeper into the woods and closer to the secrets her grandmother held. Unbeknownst to Red, the invitation would soon reveal more than a simple family visit—it would unravel a scheme that might change the course of her journey forever.

# Chapter 5: Grandmother Reveals Her Matchmaking Scheme

Grandmother settles into her rocking chair and gestures for Red to join her at the table.

Before sharing any letters or matchmaking intentions, Grandmother adopts a more serious tone, warning Red about the dangers in the woods and the importance of trusting her instincts.

She shares a cautionary rhyme and speaks cryptically about unseen threats, subtly alluding to Wolfe but not naming him outright.

After this, Grandmother shifts to a lighter mood, admitting she orchestrated Wolfe's visits in hopes of encouraging Red's happiness, and openly discusses her matchmaking schemes.

However, she also introduces the idea of Red meeting Henry, Mrs.

Grandmother glances at the window nervously, her fingers tightening around Red's hand as she pulls her a little closer. "Red, listen to me closely—there are things in these woods no one talks about. Not every path you walk is what it seems." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red pauses, her finger hovering above the page, eyes searching Grandmother's face for answers. "What do you mean, Grandmother? Is there something out there I should be afraid of?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother glances nervously at the window, her hands trembling as she clutches Red's sleeve. "There are shadows that move when they shouldn't, Red, and not all wolves wear fur." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's fingers tighten around the edge of the blanket, her eyes searching Grandmother's face for answers. "So what should I do if I meet something—or someone—that feels wrong?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother squeezes Red's hand, her gaze intense and unwavering, as if willing her warning deep into Red's memory. "Trust your instincts, Red, and remember the rhyme I taught you: 'If eyes gleam in daylight, take the longer way.'" ——Grandmother

Oakley's grandson, suggesting an openness to multiple suitors and a desire for Red to choose wisely.

Grandmother settles into her rocking chair, eyes twinkling with mischief and affection, awaiting Red's response. "Oh, my dear, I suppose it's time I confess—I didn't truly need help with the firewood. I invited Wolfe here because I saw the way you two looked at each other, and it warmed my old heart more than any blazing hearth could. I've watched your friendship blossom, and it delights me to see you happy." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's cheeks flush with surprise and a shy smile as she glances between Grandmother and Wolfe, her hands twisting nervously in her apron. "Grandmother, you knew all along—and you wanted us to spend time together?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother reaches over to gently squeeze Red's hand, her eyes twinkling with warmth and mischief. "Of course, darling—I hoped that by giving you both a little nudge, you'd find the courage to let your hearts speak freely." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red blushes, glancing shyly at Wolfe, a grateful smile tugging at her lips. "Oh, Grandmother, I never imagined you’d be so clever—or so kind; I suppose I should thank you for believing in us before we even dared to ourselves." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Red expresses surprise at her grandmother's meddling but is also touched by her care and concern.

Grandmother gently pours more tea into Red's cup, her lips curling into a mischievous smile as she watches Red's reaction, her tone playful but earnest. "You know, darling, I was talking to Mrs. Oakley at the market, and her grandson, Henry, has grown into such a fine young man. Kind, clever, and he makes the most delightful honey cakes—I thought perhaps you might enjoy meeting him, just for tea. What do you think?" ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red blushes, stirring her tea with unnecessary vigor, a half-smile tugging at her lips. "Oh, Gran, you do love a good honey cake almost as much as a good match—I hardly know Henry at all!" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother gives Red a knowing wink, her hands deftly rearranging the tea tray to make room for another cup. "Well, that's exactly why a cozy afternoon over tea and honey cake is the perfect way to get acquainted, my dear." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red gives her grandmother a teasing smile, stirring her tea while trying to hide a faint blush. "Gran, you know I can't say no when you bring out that sparkle in your eyes, but I hope this isn't just about honey cakes—or matchmaking schemes." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother pats Red's hand gently, her grin widening as she nudges the plate of honey cakes a little closer. "Oh, sweetheart, I simply want to see you happy—and if a clever boy with a warm smile and a knack for baking happens to help with that, who am I to stand in fate's way?" ——Grandmother

The conversation then explores Red's doubts about Wolfe, with Grandmother acknowledging both Wolfe’s gentle actions and the lingering air of mystery and potential danger she senses in him.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hesitantly traces the rim of her cup, her brow furrowed with concern as she looks up at Grandmother, searching for answers. "Grandmother, do you really think Wolfe is as dangerous as everyone says? I mean, he always seemed. different, but not exactly cruel. Have you ever seen another side to him?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother sets her teacup down softly, her gaze distant as if recalling memories both fond and unsettling. "Ah, my dear, sometimes those who appear fearsome are simply misunderstood, but with Wolfe, there were moments—even gentle ones—when I sensed a shadow behind his smile." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hesitated, her voice barely above a whisper as she watched the steam curl from her cup. "But how can we ever know if the shadow is just fear, or something darker waiting to show itself?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother gazes out the window, her fingers tightening around the teacup as a distant memory flickers in her eyes. "We learn much in the quiet spaces between words, Red, and sometimes the truest nature of a heart is revealed only when it believes no one is watching." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, her voice barely above a whisper, eyes searching Grandmother's face for hints of truth. "Have you ever seen Wolfe when he thought you weren't looking, Grandmother—did his shadow ever slip?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother's hands tremble slightly as she sets her cup down, her gaze distant as if recalling the memory in vivid detail. "Once, I caught a glimpse of him staring into the fire, his eyes so full of longing and loss that I almost forgot to be afraid." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red's voice is barely above a whisper as she draws her knees to her chest, watching Grandmother's face for any flicker of doubt or sympathy. "Did it make you feel sorry for him, or more wary?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother wraps her shawl tighter around her shoulders, her gaze distant as she recalls the memory. "It made me ache for the boy he must have been, but I kept the door locked just the same." ——Grandmother

Grandmother offers specific reassurances by recounting Wolfe's sincere gestures, but also admits to keeping her guard up, showing a nuanced perspective.

Grandmother sits by the hearth, her voice gentle as she gestures toward the vase of wildflowers on the windowsill. "Red, I know you worry, but I've watched Wolfe closely. Just last week, I saw him chopping wood outside in the pouring rain, determined to make sure we’d stay warm. He paused every so often to check that the door was latched—he said he didn’t want a draft to trouble me. And do you see those wildflowers on the windowsill? Wolfe brought them in himself, choosing the prettiest ones from the forest. Little gestures like these tell me he’s sincere, dear." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red fidgets with her cloak, her brow furrowed with uncertainty as she glances between the wildflowers and Grandmother. "But Grandmother, what if he's just doing those things to make himself look good—how do you know it's not all an act?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother folds her hands gently in her lap and looks at Red with a soft, reassuring smile. "Oh, Red, I understand your caution, but I've seen him do these things when no one else was watching—like the time he mended that loose floorboard in the hallway at dawn, thinking I was still asleep." ——Grandmother

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red bites her lip, glancing at the wildflowers as she waits for Grandmother's answer. "I guess. but did he ever say anything to you, Grandmother—something that made you feel he truly cared, not just showed it?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother gently places her hand over Red's, her voice soft and reassuring. "He did, dear—one evening, when my joints ached, he quietly asked which tea eased the pain and brewed it for me, telling me, 'I want you comfortable, always.'" ——Grandmother

The chapter ends with Red deeply considering both her grandmother’s warnings and hopes, the wind rattling the shutters, and the firelight flickering as Red weighs her feelings about Wolfe and her future.

----------------------------------------

As the last echoes of her grandmother’s words linger in the quiet room, Red senses the weight of new possibilities settling around her. The night air hums with anticipation, and with every shifting shadow, she feels the boundaries of her old life giving way to something uncertain but hopeful. As dawn approaches, Red finds her thoughts turning inevitably toward Wolfe, and to the choice that now lies before them both.

# Chapter 6: Red and Wolfe Choose Each Other

Inside the cottage, Grandmother stirs a pot of fragrant stew, her spectacles glinting in the golden light.

She hums a lively tune, pausing to peer out the window and watch Red and Wolfe disappear along the path.

Red's Mother, standing beside her, wipes her hands on her apron and frowns, eyes lingering on the pair.

Grandmother nudges her gently with her elbow and says, "Let the woods test them—she chose her path.

" Red's Mother sighs, then moves to set a loaf of bread on the windowsill, her gaze softening.

Together, they set the table, the clatter of dishes and the aroma of fresh herbs filling the cozy cottage.

Grandmother gently sets a floral-patterned plate on the table, her eyes crinkling with a fond smile as she glances at Red's Mother, the scent of thyme and rosemary drifting through the warm kitchen. "Now, careful with those plates, dear—you know your grandfather used to say a chipped dish brings a lucky day, but I’d rather not test that theory tonight. Oh, do you remember how he used to whistle while we cooked? I can almost hear him now, if I close my eyes." ——Grandmother

Red's MotherI brush a stray curl from Red's forehead and pass her the napkins, my eyes soft with the memory. "He always said his whistling made the soup taste brighter, though I suspect it was just his way of keeping us all smiling." ——Red's Mother

Grandmother gives Red's mother a warm, conspiratorial wink as she sets a sprig of rosemary on the table and smooths the cloth with gentle, practiced hands. "Well, perhaps we should hum a little tune ourselves—after all, happiness is the best seasoning, isn’t it?" ——Grandmother

Red's MotherI brush a stray curl from Red’s forehead, smiling as she arranges the spoons with careful concentration. "It certainly is, and with you two here, I think we’re making the happiest stew this cottage has ever known." ——Red's Mother

Grandmother ladles stew into bowls, her contented smile betraying her satisfaction at orchestrating the match.

GrandmotherShe ladles generous portions of stew into each bowl, her eyes twinkling as she glances knowingly at the empty seats set side by side at the table. "There now, nothing brings people together like a hearty meal—and a little nudge in the right direction, if you ask me." ——Grandmother
