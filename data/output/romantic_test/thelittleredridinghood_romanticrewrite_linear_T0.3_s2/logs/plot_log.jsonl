She glances down both paths, intent on choosing the shortest route to her grandmother’s cottage. Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from the shadows, his paws silent on the soft earth, tail low in a show of nonchalance. He circles Red, nose twitching at the scent of bread in her basket, and greets her in an oddly gentle, lilting tone, 'Lost, little traveler? The left path is far smoother.' Red grips her basket tighter, keeps her gaze steady, and asks, 'How do you know the way?' The Wolf, seeking to win her trust and admiration, sits and flicks his ears, feigning innocence. He points his muzzle toward the left path and says, 'I know these woods better than anyone. I can help you get to your grandmother quickly.' Red, motivated by caution and her grandmother’s need, thanks him but chooses to take the right path, announcing, 'I’ll find my own way.' The Wolf watches her go, tail twitching with annoyance, and slinks back into the undergrowth, planning his next move. The result: Red avoids the Wolf’s suggested path, and the Wolf is forced to devise a new tactic."}}

He emerges smoothly onto the path, tail wagging in a calculated display of friendliness. 'Good morning, little traveler,' he murmurs, voice low and velvety. Red's eyes narrow as she shifts her basket protectively, recalling her mother’s warnings but responding with polite curiosity. The Wolf circles her, sniffing the air, then gestures with his snout toward a sunlit clearing. 'There is a shortcut to your grandmother’s cottage through the ferns,' he suggests, his words laced with practiced charm. Red hesitates, glancing at the shadowy undergrowth, but nods, determined to prove her independence. The Wolf leads her deeper into the forest, brushing aside brambles with his paw, his eyes glinting each time he glances back at her. The scene ends with Red following the Wolf into the thickening woods, intent on reaching her grandmother quickly, while the Wolf suppresses a triumphant grin, his plan advancing."}}

The Wolf, voice smooth and practiced, replies, 'I only wish to visit your dear grandmother. I am concerned for her health, as all good neighbors should be.' Red studies his movements, blocking his path to the door while the Wolf shifts his weight, scanning for an opening. Their exchange draws out, with Red refusing to let him pass until she is satisfied with his answers, while the Wolf persistently tries to charm his way closer to the cottage.

Red, noticing the twitch of a tail beneath the blanket, narrows her eyes and moves closer, her hand hovering near the fire poker. The Wolf, sensing her suspicion, beckons her forward with a crooked finger. 'Come closer, child. My eyes are not what they used to be.' Red hesitates, then takes a deliberate step, scanning the room for anything amiss. The Wolf sniffs the air, his nose twitching at the aroma of food, and stretches out a clawed hand, barely hidden by the sleeve. Red edges toward the window, ready to call for help if needed, her actions driven by the need to protect her grandmother and herself."}}

Lucas squares his shoulders and raises his axe, calling out, 'Step aside, beast. You won't touch Red or her family.' The Wolf circles Lucas, tail flicking, and responds with a sly grin, 'Why so protective, woodcutter? She needs a friend, not a brute.' Lucas advances, swinging his axe to drive the Wolf back, forcing the Wolf to leap aside and bare his teeth. The Wolf then attempts to mimic Lucas's stance, lowering his head and growling, trying to intimidate Lucas. The confrontation ends with the Wolf retreating into the thicket, leaving Lucas breathing hard and determined to reach the cottage before the Wolf can double back."}}
