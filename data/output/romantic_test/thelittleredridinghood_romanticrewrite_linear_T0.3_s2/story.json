Red scans the shaky handwriting, her brow furrowing at Grandmother's urgent plea for help and supplies. Red's mother packs a basket with bread and herbs, warning Red to stick to the path and avoid strangers in the forest. Red fastens her cloak, slings the basket over her arm, and steps outside, determined to reach Grandmother quickly. Her mother stands at the doorway, watching Red stride down the winding trail, her motivation clear: ensure both her daughter's and mother's safety by sending Red prepared and warned.",

She glances down both paths, intent on choosing the shortest route to her grandmother’s cottage. Suddenly, The Wolf emerges from the shadows, his paws silent on the soft earth, tail low in a show of nonchalance. He circles Red, nose twitching at the scent of bread in her basket, and greets her in an oddly gentle, lilting tone, 'Lost, little traveler? The left path is far smoother.' Red grips her basket tighter, keeps her gaze steady, and asks, 'How do you know the way?' The Wolf, seeking to win her trust and admiration, sits and flicks his ears, feigning innocence. He points his muzzle toward the left path and says, 'I know these woods better than anyone. I can help you get to your grandmother quickly.' Red, motivated by caution and her grandmother’s need, thanks him but chooses to take the right path, announcing, 'I’ll find my own way.' The Wolf watches her go, tail twitching with annoyance, and slinks back into the undergrowth, planning his next move. The result: Red avoids the Wolf’s suggested path, and the Wolf is forced to devise a new tactic.",

She pauses to pick a cluster of violets, brushing dirt from their delicate stems. The Wolf, concealed behind a thicket, presses his body low against the earth, ears twitching as he studies her movements. He emerges smoothly onto the path, tail wagging in a calculated display of friendliness. 'Good morning, little traveler,' he murmurs, voice low and velvety. Red's eyes narrow as she shifts her basket protectively, recalling her mother’s warnings but responding with polite curiosity. The Wolf circles her, sniffing the air, then gestures with his snout toward a sunlit clearing. 'There is a shortcut to your grandmother’s cottage through the ferns,' he suggests, his words laced with practiced charm. Red hesitates, glancing at the shadowy undergrowth, but nods, determined to prove her independence. The Wolf leads her deeper into the forest, brushing aside brambles with his paw, his eyes glinting each time he glances back at her.

The Wolf, fur streaked with mud and eyes glinting with intent, emerges from the thickets and circles the clearing, sniffing the air. He approaches, tail low, and mimics a cough to catch Red's attention. Red tightens her grip on the basket, steps between the Wolf and the cottage, and asks, 'What brings you here, stranger?' The Wolf, voice smooth and practiced, replies, 'I only wish to visit your dear grandmother. I am concerned for her health, as all good neighbors should be.' Red studies his movements, blocking his path to the door while the Wolf shifts his weight, scanning for an opening. Their exchange draws out, with Red refusing to let him pass until she is satisfied with his answers, while the Wolf persistently tries to charm his way closer to the cottage. The objective is Red protecting her grandmother from the Wolf and the Wolf attempting to gain entry through cunning; the outcome is a tense stalemate at the cottage threshold.",

Red, noticing the twitch of a tail beneath the blanket, narrows her eyes and moves closer, her hand hovering near the fire poker. The Wolf, sensing her suspicion, beckons her forward with a crooked finger. 'Come closer, child. My eyes are not what they used to be.' Red hesitates, then takes a deliberate step, scanning the room for anything amiss. The Wolf sniffs the air, his nose twitching at the aroma of food, and stretches out a clawed hand, barely hidden by the sleeve.

Lucas squares his shoulders and raises his axe, calling out, 'Step aside, beast. You won't touch Red or her family.' The Wolf circles Lucas, tail flicking, and responds with a sly grin, 'Why so protective, woodcutter? She needs a friend, not a brute.' Lucas advances, swinging his axe to drive the Wolf back, forcing the Wolf to leap aside and bare his teeth. The Wolf then attempts to mimic Lucas's stance, lowering his head and growling, trying to intimidate Lucas. The confrontation ends with the Wolf retreating into the thicket, leaving Lucas breathing hard and determined to reach the cottage before the Wolf can double back.",
