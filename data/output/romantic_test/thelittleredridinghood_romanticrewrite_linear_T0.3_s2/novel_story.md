# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Urgent Letter

Red sits at the wooden table, tying her cloak as her mother paces and unfolds a crumpled letter.

Instead of reading a letter from Grandmother, Red discovers that the letter is actually from her mother—a heartfelt message meant to encourage and guide Red on her journey.

Red Riding HoodRed looks down at the sealed letter in her trembling hands, her eyes flickering between her mother's anxious face and the unfamiliar script on the envelope. "Mama, what is this? It feels heavier than just words on paper… Do I really have to read it out loud?" ——Red Riding Hood

Red's MotherShe gently presses Red's fingers around the letter, her eyes shining with hope and a hint of worry. "Yes, Red, please—sometimes, words need voices to carry their meaning all the way to the heart." ——Red's Mother

Red Riding HoodRed glances at her mother, then unfolds the letter slowly, her fingers trembling as she prepares to read. "Alright, Mama—I'll try, but my hands are shaking a little." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed carefully unfolds the letter, her gaze flickering between the ink and her mother's hopeful eyes. "Here goes, Mama—I'll read every word, even if my voice trembles." ——Red Riding Hood

Red's MotherShe gently squeezes Red's hand, her eyes shining with encouragement and quiet hope. "That's all I ask, my dear—let the words find their way, no matter how softly they begin." ——Red's Mother

Red Riding HoodRed unfolds the letter slowly, her voice wavering as she begins to read, her eyes searching her mother's face for reassurance. "Mama, the first line says, 'To my dearest Red, whose courage shines brighter than any lantern in the woods…'" ——Red Riding Hood

Red's MotherShe gently squeezes Red's shoulder, her eyes shining with hope and a hint of worry. "Keep going, darling—there's something in those words I want you to hear, something about who you truly are." ——Red's Mother

Red Riding HoodRed's eyes glisten as she pauses, glancing at her mother with a mixture of wonder and uncertainty. "The next part reads, 'May you always remember that even in shadow, your light guides those who are lost.'" ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed glances up at her mother, voice trembling, letter clutched tightly in her hands. "Mama, did you write this just for me—so I wouldn’t forget who I am, even if the path gets dark?" ——Red Riding Hood

Red's MotherShe gently squeezes Red's trembling hands, her eyes shining with hope and love. "Yes, my sweet Red, I wrote every word so you'd have my voice beside you when the woods feel lonely." ——Red's Mother

Red's mother asks Red to read the letter aloud, revealing its contents: words of affirmation and advice for Red to remember her courage and light when facing the unknown.

Moved, Red promises her mother to stay on the path and heed her warnings, her determination to help Grandmother now strengthened by her mother's written support.

Red Riding HoodRed carefully puts the basket over her arm, glancing toward the edge of the forest with a mixture of curiosity and caution. "I understand, Mother. I'll stay on the path like you said, and I won't talk to anyone I don't know. The woods always seem a little mysterious, but I promise I'll be careful." ——Red Riding Hood

Red fastens her cloak, slings the basket over her arm, and steps outside, carrying both the supplies for Grandmother and the reassurance of her mother's love.

Her mother stands at the doorway, watching Red stride down the winding trail, confident that Red goes prepared—emotionally and practically—for the journey ahead.

# Chapter 2: The Encounter at the Crossroads

Red Riding Hood steps carefully through the tangled, dew-soaked forest, pausing at a crossroads as she considers her route to Grandmother’s cottage.

The Wolf emerges, greeting her gently and engaging her in conversation about her grandmother, her visits, and the dangers that might lurk if she strays from the main path.

The Wolf subtly encourages Red to take the left path, claiming it is smoother and faster, and repeatedly offers to accompany her as a helpful guide.

Red, cautious but polite, questions the Wolf’s knowledge and motives, but is ultimately swayed by his assurances and agrees, at least for a short distance, to let him guide her along the suggested path.

The Wolf circles Red, his head tilted in a show of harmless curiosity, though his eyes linger on the basket she clutches. His tail sways gently, as if to soothe, while his voice purrs with an unsettling kindness. "Lost, little traveler? The woods can be a maze for those not accustomed to their ways." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing past the Wolf as if to reassure herself of the way ahead. "Oh, I'm not lost—I'm just taking this bread to my grandmother's cottage, just down the path." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting with curiosity as he steps lightly alongside Red, his tail flicking with feigned casualness. "Ah, such devotion—your grandmother is fortunate to have someone so caring; tell me, does she often receive visitors in her little cottage?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed hugs her basket a little closer, glancing down the path as if reassuring herself of her purpose. "Not very often; she lives alone, so I bring her treats whenever I can." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf tilts his head, his gaze lingering just a moment too long, as if weighing the information. "How thoughtful—your visits must truly brighten her days, especially in such a quiet, secluded place." ——The Wolf

The Wolf cocks his head, eyes glinting with curiosity as he edges a step closer, his tail flicking softly behind him. "And does your path always lead you straight to her door, or do you ever wander through the deeper shadows of the forest?" ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed clutches her basket a little tighter, her eyes darting to the dense trees as she recalls her mother's warning. "Oh, I always stick to the main path—Mama says the woods can be dangerous if you stray too far." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf's gaze lingers on Red a moment too long, his smile stretching just slightly, before he melts back into the shadows beside the path. "Indeed, wise advice—one never knows what hungry eyes might be watching from the thicket." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed tightens her grip on the basket and offers the Wolf a polite, cautious smile, her eyes flicking nervously to the shadows between the trees. "Thank you for the warning, sir, but I’m sure I’ll be safe as long as I mind Mama’s words." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf tilts his head, his eyes glinting as he steps aside, subtly angling his body to block a fork in the path behind him. "Of course, little one—a clever traveler is seldom caught unawares, yet sometimes even the most careful can be surprised by what lies just beyond the bend." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed tightens her grip on the basket and offers the Wolf a polite, cautious smile, edging subtly away from his circling form. "I suppose that's true, but I promise I won't take any shortcuts—Grandmother will be waiting for me and I don't want to worry her." ——Red Riding Hood

However, as they proceed, Red’s wariness returns, and she reasserts her independence, politely but firmly deciding to continue on her own, in line with her mother’s warnings.

The Wolf gestures grandly toward the left path, his eyes glinting with a mix of charm and cunning. "Well, well, Red. Look at that—the left path is smooth as silk. Much easier on your dainty feet, wouldn’t you say? Might even get us to Grandma’s house faster." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood narrows her eyes at the Wolf, clutching her basket a little tighter. "It does look tempting, but sometimes the easiest path hides the most danger—why are you so eager for me to take it?" ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf flashes a toothy grin and gestures invitingly down the left path, trying to appear casual while watching Red's reaction closely. "Oh, come now, Red, can't a wolf be concerned for your comfort—besides, the sooner we arrive, the sooner you can deliver those treats to your dear grandmother." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood hesitates at the fork, glancing warily at the Wolf before starting down the main, bumpier path. "That’s true, but my mother always warned me that shortcuts can lead to trouble—what if we stick to the main path, just to be safe?" ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf shrugs theatrically and glances down the smooth left path, masking a glint of impatience in his eyes. "Suit yourself, Red, but don’t blame me when your shoes are muddied and your basket heavier with every step." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood tightens her grip on the basket and takes a determined step onto the main path, glancing warily at the Wolf. "I’d rather have muddy shoes than risk something unexpected—Grandma’s safety is more important than a clean walk." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf, frustrated but maintaining a façade of concern, tries to persuade her further, but Red stands her ground and departs alone, determined to keep her promise to her mother.

Red Riding HoodRed grips her basket tightly, her voice calm but edged with suspicion as she studies the Wolf's face for any sign of deception. "How do you know the way to Grandmother's house?" ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf offers a sly, toothy smile, his eyes glinting with something unreadable as he steps lightly over a patch of moss. "Ah, my dear, the woods whisper many secrets to those who listen closely." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed narrows her eyes, keeping a careful distance as she steps further down the shadowed path. "But only those with honest hearts can truly hear them—are you sure that's what they're telling you?" ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf grins, lips curling back just enough to show the edge of a fang as he steps lightly over a knot of roots, keeping pace with Red. "Why, of course, little one—honesty and hunger both sharpen the ears, though one is rather more urgent than the other." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodShe shifts her basket to her other arm, subtly placing more distance between herself and the Wolf. "Red narrows her eyes, stepping back just a touch as she says, 'Then perhaps you should be careful which voice you listen to—sometimes hunger drowns out the truth.'" ——Red Riding Hood

The WolfHe takes a slow, deliberate step closer, his gaze fixed on Red's basket. "The Wolf bares his teeth in a smile that doesn't reach his eyes, replying, 'And sometimes, little Red, the truth is simply what you survive to tell.'" ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodShe shifts her weight, eyes darting to the tangled shadows between the trees, watching for any sudden movement from the Wolf. "Red steadies her grip on the basket and says, 'Surviving isn’t the same as knowing the way—some paths aren’t meant for hungry travelers.'" ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf's gaze flickers over Red's basket, his tail giving a slow, deliberate sweep through the leaf litter. "Ah, but every path leaves its mark on those who tread it, and hunger remembers every twist and turn." ——The Wolf

Red Riding HoodRed shifts her weight, edging further from the Wolf while her eyes never leave his. "Then I suppose I'll have to trust my own steps more than the stories of strangers." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf slinks back into the shadows, forced to devise a new plan now that Red has resisted his company and his shortcut.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Wolf’s Deceptive Invitation

Red Riding Hood steps carefully over a gnarled root, her wicker basket bouncing lightly against her hip.

She pauses, not just to pick violets, but to reflect on her mother's advice about the dangers and surprises lurking in the woods.

Her curiosity is piqued;

she speaks aloud, wondering about the creatures and mysteries she might encounter.

The Wolf, concealed behind a thicket, listens closely, intrigued by her brave questions.

He emerges smoothly onto the path, tail wagging in a calculated display of friendliness.

Red Riding HoodRed adjusts her grip on the basket, eyes scanning the shadows between the trees, her voice steady but edged with careful curiosity. "Good afternoon. My mother always says the woods can be full of surprises, so I try to be careful. Still, I can't help but wonder who or what I might meet along this path. Is there something—or someone—I should be especially mindful of today?" ——Red Riding Hood

'Step into the light, little one,' he murmurs, voice low and velvety, challenging her courage rather than feigning harmlessness.

The Wolf's yellow eyes glint with a mix of challenge and invitation as he holds his stance, the muscles beneath his fur taut with anticipation. "Step into the light, little one. The shadows hide many things, but out there—everything is revealed. Are you brave enough to see what's waiting?" ——The Wolf

Red narrows her eyes, gripping her basket protectively, but responds openly, expressing her resolve to face her fears and prove herself.

She affirms her independence, voicing her determination not to let fear dictate her actions.

Red Riding HoodRed takes a steadying breath, pulling her cloak tighter around her shoulders as she stands at the edge of the path, eyes fixed on the uncertain darkness ahead. "Even if my heart beats faster with every step, I know I have to do this on my own. I can’t let fear decide for me anymore." ——Red Riding Hood

Red Riding HoodRed draws a steadying breath and steps forward, her hands clenched tightly around her basket. "If I turn back now, I'll never know what I'm truly capable of." ——Red Riding Hood

The Wolf, sensing her resolve, gestures toward a sunlit clearing and suggests a shortcut to her grandmother’s cottage through the ferns, testing her bravery further.

Red hesitates, but her determination to see what she is capable of prevails, and she agrees to follow, intent on both helping her grandmother and confronting the forest's mysteries.

The Wolf leads her deeper into the woods, his eyes glinting each time he glances back, pleased that his challenge has drawn her in.

The scene ends with Red following the Wolf, her courage guiding her into the thickening woods, while the Wolf suppresses a triumphant grin, adjusting his plans to account for Red's boldness.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Wolf Arrives at the Cottage

Red Riding Hood confronts the Wolf at her grandmother's cottage, catching him in several lies about his intentions and recent activities.

Red is even more assertive and suspicious than before, refusing to let Wolf approach and interrogating him about the smell of smoke and iron on his fur.

The Wolf, caught off guard, offers increasingly flimsy excuses and attempts to charm Red, but she holds her ground, threatening to defend the cottage with force if necessary.

The exchange escalates into a verbal standoff, with Red making it clear she will not be fooled or intimidated.

The situation remains tense, but the Wolf is unable to gain any ground or entry to the cottage, and Red emerges as the clear defender, ready to use both wit and force to protect her grandmother.

The outcome is still a stalemate at the cottage threshold, but with Red demonstrating even greater suspicion, resourcefulness, and readiness to fight.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red’s Suspicious Reunion

Red Riding Hood steps onto the handwoven rug, her boots leaving damp prints from the muddy forest path.

She sets her basket on the table, glancing at the figure in Grandmother's bed.

The Wolf, disguised beneath Grandmother's quilt, carefully adjusts the cap over his ears and coughs softly, but rather than merely mimicking a frail voice, he turns overtly persuasive and seductive, weaving a web of words to lure Red closer.

He appeals to her loneliness and offers comfort, inviting her to step into his 'protection' and promising rest in his embrace, while still masking his true intentions.

Red, unsettled by his unusually intimate and manipulative tone, becomes even more cautious, edging toward the window and ready to call for help if needed, driven by a heightened sense of danger and the need to protect her grandmother and herself.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Lucas Confronts the Wolf

Lucas, gripping his worn axe, steps quietly through the underbrush, scanning for signs of Red or danger.

He pauses to study a set of oversized paw prints embedded in the soft mud, then crouches behind a fallen log.

The Wolf emerges from the shadow of a fir tree, his fur bristling and eyes glinting, blocking the path to Grandmother's cottage.

Lucas squares his shoulders and raises his axe, calling out, 'Step aside, beast.

Lucas plants his feet firmly, gripping his axe tighter, eyes locked on the looming shape before him. "I won't let fear rule me tonight. Whatever you are, you won't pass." ——Lucas

Lucas grips his axe tighter, planting his feet firmly as he stares down the beast. "I've faced worse in darker halls—tonight, it's your turn to yield." ——Lucas

You won't touch Red or her family.

Lucas steps forward, his eyes narrowed and voice steady, blocking the path between the antagonist and Red's family. "Listen closely—I don't care who you think you are, but if you so much as lay a finger on Red or her family, you'll regret ever crossing me. I won't let anything happen to them." ——Lucas

' The Wolf circles Lucas, tail flicking, but instead of responding with a sly grin and intimidation, he reveals a moment of vulnerability: 'Why so protective, woodcutter?

The Wolf circles Lucas, eyes glinting with mischief, tail flicking in anticipation as he leans in, voice low and teasing. "Why so protective, woodcutter? You clutch your axe as if it’s a shield, but I wonder—who are you really trying to protect? Or perhaps, what are you trying to hide?" ——The Wolf

You clutch your axe as if it’s a shield, but I wonder—who are you really trying to protect?

The Wolf lowers his head, his ears flattening back, voice rough but quiet. He glances away, fidgeting with his paws, uncertain. "You know, it's funny. Every time I try to help, claws or teeth, that's all anyone seems to notice. Maybe that's all I am to them—a brute, a beast. But. I don't want to scare you. I want to be there, to listen, to be a friend. I just—I'm not sure how. I'm trying, though. I promise." ——The Wolf

Or perhaps, what are you trying to hide?

' The Wolf hesitates, expressing that he is misunderstood, 'You know, it's funny.

Every time I try to help, claws or teeth, that's all anyone seems to notice.

Maybe that's all I am to them—a brute, a beast.

But. I don't want to scare you.

I want to be there, to listen, to be a friend.

I just—I'm not sure how.

I'm trying, though.

I promise.

' Lucas remains guarded and determined, advancing to drive the Wolf back, but is taken aback by the Wolf's moment of honesty.

The confrontation ends with the Wolf retreating into the thicket, leaving Lucas breathing hard and more conflicted, but still determined to reach the cottage before the Wolf can double back.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: The Confession in the Clearing

Red Riding Hood hides behind an old pine, heart pounding as she listens for movement in the underbrush.

Lucas calls out to her, his voice tense with worry.

She responds, and he rushes to her side, immediately checking if she’s hurt.

Lucas steps further into the clearing, scanning the shadows as his voice trembles with worry. He listens intently for any sign of movement, his eyes darting between the trees. "Red? Red, are you out here? Please—answer me if you can. It’s Lucas. I need to know you’re alright." ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed's voice trembles as she peers out from behind the thick trunk, clutching her torn cloak tight around her shoulders, her eyes wide and anxious. "Lucas, over here—behind the old pine, please hurry!" ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas rushes toward the old pine, scanning the shadows for Red, his breath quick and eyes wide with worry. "Red, thank god—I heard something moving in the brush and I thought—are you hurt?" ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed crouches lower behind the trunk, clutching her red cloak tightly around her shoulders as she scans the darkening woods. "No, I’m not hurt, but I saw it—something’s out there, Lucas, watching us." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas crouches beside Red, eyes scanning the shadowy treeline, his hand reaching for hers as twigs snap somewhere deeper in the woods. "Stay close to me, Red—we need to keep moving before whatever it is decides to come closer." ——Lucas

Red Riding Hood presses her back against the rough bark, eyes wide and darting as she grabs Lucas’s arm. "I don’t know how long it’s been following me, Lucas, but I can hear its footsteps circling us." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas crouches beside Red, scanning the shadowed tree line, his hand hovering protectively near hers. "We’ll get you out of here, I promise, but you have to trust me—when I say run, you run, understand?" ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed reaches out, her hand trembling as she grasps Lucas's, eyes darting nervously toward the shadows shifting between the trees. "I trust you, Lucas—just don’t let go of my hand, no matter what happens." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas tightens his grip on her hand, guiding her through the tangled undergrowth as the sounds in the darkness grow closer. "I won’t let go, Red—not for anything; just keep your eyes on me and stay low." ——Lucas

Red Riding Hood squeezes Lucas’s hand, her breath coming in quick, shallow bursts as she glances nervously over her shoulder into the shadows. "If we make it past the creek, there’s a hollow where we can hide until it’s safe." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas squeezes Red’s hand, scanning the dark tree line as he positions himself protectively between her and the shifting shadows beyond. "The creek’s not far—on my count, we move together, as quiet as we can." ——Lucas

Lucas grips Red’s hand tightly and leads her in a swift, silent dash toward the creek, scanning the shadows for any sign of movement. "Ready, Red—three, two, one—now!" ——Lucas

Red confesses she senses a presence stalking them, circling in the shadows.

Lucas tightens his grip on the battered hatchet, glancing around the shifting darkness, every muscle tense and ready. "Red, stay close. I found fresh tracks just beyond the ridge—big ones. The wolf’s been prowling here, and it’s not shy. Keep your eyes sharp." ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed tightens her cloak around her shoulders, glancing nervously into the darkened woods. "Do you really think it's watching us right now, Lucas?" ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas tightens his grip on the hatchet, eyes sweeping the darkening tree line, his stance protective as he positions himself slightly ahead of Red. "I wouldn’t doubt it for a second—the wind’s shifted, and beasts like that know when strangers enter their ground." ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed tightens her cloak around her shoulders, glancing nervously at the darkening trees. "Then we’d better make sure it doesn’t catch us off guard—show me where you found the tracks, Lucas." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas insists she stay close, promising not to let go of her hand, and instructs her to trust him and run if needed.

Red Riding HoodRed straightens her cloak, her gaze steady despite the fresh scrapes on her knees. She starts down the path, glancing back to make sure Lucas is following. "We can't stop now, Lucas. Grandmother's counting on us, and the woods will only get darker if we wait. Whatever's out there, we face it together." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas glances warily at the thickening trees, tightening his grip on his walking stick as he falls in beside her. "You're right, Red—I'll stay close and keep watch, but if anything moves in the shadows, promise me you'll let me handle it first." ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed adjusts her hood, glances anxiously at the looming trees, and sets a brisk pace along the path. "I promise, Lucas, but we have to keep moving—the air feels heavier with every minute we linger." ——Red Riding Hood

Red, openly trusting, asks Lucas not to let go, and suggests a plan: if they make it past the creek, there’s a hollow where they can hide.

Lucas stands with his hands clenched at his sides, his voice trembling as he finally meets Red's eyes, vulnerability exposed. "Red, I. I know it's not my place, but I can't help worrying about you. Every time you go out there, into the woods, I can't breathe right until I know you're safe. And—this probably sounds foolish, but—it's because I care about you. More than I've let myself admit before." ——Lucas

Red Riding HoodRed steps closer, her eyes shining with relief and warmth, gently taking Lucas's hand in hers. "Oh, Lucas, you have no idea how much it means to hear you say that—and I promise, I’ll be careful, but I care about you too, more than I realized until this moment." ——Red Riding Hood

Lucas takes charge, counting down before they move quietly together.

He finds fresh wolf tracks beyond the ridge and warns Red.

The pair discuss the likelihood of the wolf watching them even now.

Red, determined, urges Lucas to show her the tracks and insists they must press on to Grandmother’s cottage, facing whatever comes together.

Lucas, protective, asks Red to let him handle any danger first, and finally confesses his deep feelings for her.

Red is moved by his words and reciprocates his feelings, promising to be careful as they continue toward the cottage, united and alert.
