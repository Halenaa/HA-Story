Instead of reading a letter from Grandmother, Red discovers that the letter is actually from her mother—a heartfelt message meant to encourage and guide Red on her journey. Red's mother asks Red to read the letter aloud, revealing its contents: words of affirmation and advice for Red to remember her courage and light when facing the unknown. Moved, Red promises her mother to stay on the path and heed her warnings, her determination to help Grandmother now strengthened by her mother's written support. Red fastens her cloak, slings the basket over her arm, and steps outside, carrying both the supplies for Grandmother and the reassurance of her mother's love. Her mother stands at the doorway, watching Red stride down the winding trail, confident that Red goes prepared—emotionally and practically—for the journey ahead.",

The Wolf emerges, greeting her gently and engaging her in conversation about her grandmother, her visits, and the dangers that might lurk if she strays from the main path. The Wolf subtly encourages Red to take the left path, claiming it is smoother and faster, and repeatedly offers to accompany her as a helpful guide. Red, cautious but polite, questions the Wolf’s knowledge and motives, but is ultimately swayed by his assurances and agrees, at least for a short distance, to let him guide her along the suggested path. However, as they proceed, Red’s wariness returns, and she reasserts her independence, politely but firmly deciding to continue on her own, in line with her mother’s warnings. The Wolf, frustrated but maintaining a façade of concern, tries to persuade her further, but Red stands her ground and departs alone, determined to keep her promise to her mother. The Wolf slinks back into the shadows, forced to devise a new plan now that Red has resisted his company and his shortcut.",

She shows more openness to the Wolf’s guidance before ultimately reaffirming her independence and choosing to walk alone, which is a more gradual process than the original plot’s direct refusal. The updated plot reflects this nuanced interaction and maintains character logic and continuity."

She pauses, not just to pick violets, but to reflect on her mother's advice about the dangers and surprises lurking in the woods. Her curiosity is piqued; she speaks aloud, wondering about the creatures and mysteries she might encounter. The Wolf, concealed behind a thicket, listens closely, intrigued by her brave questions. He emerges smoothly onto the path, tail wagging in a calculated display of friendliness. 'Step into the light, little one,' he murmurs, voice low and velvety, challenging her courage rather than feigning harmlessness. Red narrows her eyes, gripping her basket protectively, but responds openly, expressing her resolve to face her fears and prove herself. She affirms her independence, voicing her determination not to let fear dictate her actions. The Wolf, sensing her resolve, gestures toward a sunlit clearing and suggests a shortcut to her grandmother’s cottage through the ferns, testing her bravery further. Red hesitates, but her determination to see what she is capable of prevails, and she agrees to follow, intent on both helping her grandmother and confronting the forest's mysteries. The Wolf leads her deeper into the woods, his eyes glinting each time he glances back, pleased that his challenge has drawn her in. The scene ends with Red following the Wolf, her courage guiding her into the thickening woods, while the Wolf suppresses a triumphant grin, adjusting his plans to account for Red's boldness.",

The exchange escalates into a verbal standoff, with Red making it clear she will not be fooled or intimidated. The situation remains tense, but the Wolf is unable to gain any ground or entry to the cottage, and Red emerges as the clear defender, ready to use both wit and force to protect her grandmother.

He appeals to her loneliness and offers comfort, inviting her to step into his 'protection' and promising rest in his embrace, while still masking his true intentions.

Lucas squares his shoulders and raises his axe, calling out, 'Step aside, beast. You won't touch Red or her family.' The Wolf circles Lucas, tail flicking, but instead of responding with a sly grin and intimidation, he reveals a moment of vulnerability: 'Why so protective, woodcutter? You clutch your axe as if it’s a shield, but I wonder—who are you really trying to protect? Or perhaps, what are you trying to hide?' The Wolf hesitates, expressing that he is misunderstood, 'You know, it's funny. Every time I try to help, claws or teeth, that's all anyone seems to notice. Maybe that's all I am to them—a brute, a beast. But... I don't want to scare you. I want to be there, to listen, to be a friend. I just—I'm not sure how. I'm trying, though. I promise.'
