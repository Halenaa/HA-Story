She pauses to scan the dense thicket ahead, her eyes narrowing at a tall figure standing in the shadow of a crooked birch tree. The Wolf, cloaked in an ill-fitting shawl, leans forward and sniffs the air loudly, his nose twitching as he fixes his gaze on the basket. Red shifts the basket behind her, her voice steady but wary as she calls out, 'Who’s there? What are you doing on this path?' The Wolf straightens, his tail barely concealed beneath the shawl, and replies smoothly, 'Just a weary traveler, young miss. I wondered what you carry that smells so sweet.' Red edges sideways, keeping the Wolf in sight, and inches closer to the cottage gate. The Wolf steps forward, paws muffled by moss, craning his head as if to peer at Red’s basket, his hunger barely masked by a toothy smile. Red tightens her grip and glances at the cottage door, calculating the distance, determined to reach her grandmother’s safely. The Wolf’s ears flick, weighing if he should block her path or continue the ruse. The wind rises, rustling the leaves, as Red takes a bold step onto the cottage’s stone porch, refusing to turn her back to the stranger.",

Pausing to adjust her red cloak, she noticed a patch of wildflowers and bent to gather some for her grandmother, brushing soil from their stems. Suddenly, a deep voice rumbled from behind a tree: 'You walk with purpose, little one.' The Wolf emerged, his fur gleaming silver in the dappled light, nose twitching as he sniffed the basket's scent of bread and herbs. Red straightened, meeting his gaze and tightening her grip on the basket, wary of his reputation but determined to show no fear. The Wolf circled, tail low but ears pricked, watching Red’s hands as he proposed, 'The woods hold secrets, and I could help you pass safely—if you share what you carry.' Red considered his offer, stepping back and glancing down the path, her mind racing with her mother’s warning and her own need to reach Grandmother before nightfall. The Wolf’s eyes followed her movements, his head tilting as he waited for her response, the tension between wariness and curiosity hanging in the cool forest air. The encounter ended with Red declining the proposition, firmly stating, 'These are for my grandmother. If you wish to help, show me the way, not your teeth.' The Wolf, intrigued and amused, melted into the shadows, leaving Red to hurry onward, senses sharpened by the meeting.",

As he speaks, a brief flashback overlays: the Wolf darting through tangled underbrush before first light, paws silent on wet leaves, stopping only to peer through Grandmother's window and sniff the lingering scent of fever tea and woodsmoke. Red’s suspicion deepens, but she steps forward, determined to reach the cottage first. The Wolf, conflicted, chooses to pace beside her instead of dashing ahead, driven by a new resolve to protect rather than ambush. They move together, the crunch of their footsteps and the rustle of leaves marking their uneasy alliance.",
