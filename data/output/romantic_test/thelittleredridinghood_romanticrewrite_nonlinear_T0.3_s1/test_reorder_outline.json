        "title": "Red’s Suspicion and Bold Entry",
        "summary": "Red arrives at the cottage and notices subtle oddities in 'Grandmother’s' appearance and voice. Suspicious but curious, Red questions the Wolf in disguise with pointed remarks, prompting the Wolf to reveal his true identity. Confronted, Red demands to know where her grandmother is, threatening to call for help.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Initial Suspenseful Encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Narrate from a third person limited perspective, closely following Red. Use present tense for immediate events, but layer subtle exposition to orient the reader to Red’s uncertainty about her surroundings and the disguised Wolf. Avoid referencing prior events or relationships not yet established for reader. Red should be wary and unfamiliar with the Wolf's identity at this stage.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with Red’s arrival at the cottage, using sensory details (sight, sound) to immerse the reader and establish immediate tension. No references to past events; establish Red as newly arriving."

        "title": "The Wolf’s Proposition",
        "summary": "Red encounters the charming Wolf, who engages her in conversation and slyly asks about her destination.

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "First Forest Encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue using third person limited, closely following Red. Present events in past tense as a flashback triggered by Red’s current suspicions in the cottage (from Chapter 4). Ensure character relationships align: Red is meeting the Wolf for the first time, and initial intrigue or unease should echo Red's suspicions in the previous chapter.",
        "transition_hint": "Seamlessly transition via Red’s recollection—e.g., as she studies the Wolf’s features in the cottage, she remembers her earlier forest conversation. Use a sensory or emotional trigger (voice, eyes) to cue the flashback."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Mission and Motivation Setup",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, tightly focused on Red’s perspective.

Highlight Red’s motivation (to help her grandmother, to prove herself).",
        "transition_hint": "Transition via internal monologue: as Red recalls the forest meeting, she wonders how she even got herself into this mess, leading into memories of her mother’s instructions."

        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "Alliance and Bargaining",
        "narrative_instruction": "Return to third person limited, present tense, anchored in Red’s experience in the cottage. Resume the immediate timeline from the opening chapter, with Red and the Wolf negotiating. Character familiarity should match what has been established through the flashbacks.",
        "transition_hint": "Signal the end of the flashbacks by returning to the present: e.g., Red snaps back to the tense moment in the cottage, confronted by the Wolf’s true identity."

        "narrative_role": "Wolf’s Secret Actions Revealed",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, but briefly shift the focalization to the Wolf (while keeping the same narrator and tense), revealing his actions leading up to the cottage scene. Use a flashback, prompted by Red’s suspicions or the Wolf’s confession. Ensure the Wolf’s feelings and motivations are subtly revealed, setting up later romantic tension.",
        "transition_hint": "Use dialogue or a visual cue (e.g., the Wolf adjusting Grandmother’s shawl) to trigger the Wolf’s recollection of how he arrived first and what happened before Red entered."

        "narrative_role": "Crisis and Resolution",
