Red edges sideways, keeping the Wolf in sight, and inches closer to the cottage gate. The Wolf steps forward, paws muffled by moss, craning his head as if to peer at Red’s basket, his hunger barely masked by a toothy smile.

Red considered his offer, stepping back and glancing down the path, her mind racing with her mother’s warning and her own need to reach Grandmother before nightfall. The Wolf’s eyes followed her movements, his head tilting as he waited for her response, the tension between wariness and curiosity hanging in the cool forest air. The encounter ended with Red declining the proposition, firmly stating, 'These are for my grandmother. If you wish to help, show me the way, not your teeth.' The Wolf, intrigued and amused, melted into the shadows, leaving Red to hurry onward, senses sharpened by the meeting."}}
