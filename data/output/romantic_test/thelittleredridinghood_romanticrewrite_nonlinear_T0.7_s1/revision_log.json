Grandmother is less orchestrative and more responsive, and Red is present but not yet physically demonstrative. The updated plot reflects this more gradual build of trust and connection.",

However, Red opens the letter anyway, driven by her curiosity, while her mother insists on supporting her. The original plot did not mention the debate about waiting until dawn, nor the specific mention of the wolf's head on the seal, but these are consistent with the characters' motivations and do not contradict the established plot. The updated plot incorporates these nuances for a natural flow.",

The Wolf confesses due to Red's bravery, not Grandmother's surprise attack. Grandmother is revealed to have been locked away, not observing and intervening at the critical moment. The updated plot shifts the moment of revelation and confrontation agency from Grandmother to Red, aligning with the dialogue's structure and maintaining character logic.",
