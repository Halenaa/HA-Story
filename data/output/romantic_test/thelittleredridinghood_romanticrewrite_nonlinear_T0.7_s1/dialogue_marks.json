He paused at the stone path, nose twitching as he caught the scent of bread baking and herbs from Grandmother’s kitchen. Grandmother, standing at the threshold, tightened her shawl and watched him through narrowed eyes, leaning on her broom. The Wolf approached with a calculated slowness, tail low, and offered a courteous dip of his head. 'You keep an inviting home, old one,' he said, voice smooth as running water. Grandmother did not step aside but instead tapped the ground with her broom, her gaze unwavering. 'I hear many things in these woods, Wolf. Some say you’re searching for someone—perhaps a girl in red?' she said, testing the truth of the rumors. The Wolf, caught by the question, flicked his tail and sat on his haunches, feigning indifference while his eyes roved to the cottage door. 'Curiosity brings me many places,' he replied. Grandmother watched him closely, gauging his intent, and kept the door closed between them. Their exchange ended with Grandmother scattering a handful of dried sage at the threshold—a sign the Wolf was not yet welcome inside—and the Wolf retreating to the shadow of a fir tree, his curiosity about this rumored Red Riding Hood piqued. The objective of the scene is to establish the Wolf’s initial interest in Red and Grandmother’s cautious, probing welcome; the outcome is a wary truce and a spark of the Wolf’s pursuit.",

The Wolf, driven by restless curiosity and a mounting urge to reveal his feelings, hesitates before finally stepping closer, claws quietly scraping the floorboards. He lowers his voice, confessing to Grandmother first—'I mean no harm; I only wished to know her heart.' Grandmother, spoon in hand, stirs the tea, her sharp eyes evaluating the Wolf’s candor, referencing their earlier wary exchanges. She nods, permitting him to continue. Red, motivated by her own curiosity and the trust that has grown between them, reaches out and rests her hand on Wolf’s thick fur. The Wolf, emboldened, gently nuzzles her palm, and with Grandmother’s approving glance, Red leans forward and presses a brief, deliberate kiss to his brow. The Wolf blinks, tail thumping once. Grandmother sets down her cup, quietly satisfied, having orchestrated a safe moment for honesty. The rain outside intensifies, muffling the world in a cocoon of sound, as the three remain gathered by the fire, the Wolf’s confession shifting the balance between caution and connection.",

She crouched to inspect a cluster of wild violets, intent on gathering them for her grandmother. Suddenly, a large, gray-furred Wolf emerged from the shadows, his amber eyes fixed on Red. The Wolf circled just beyond arm’s reach, tail flicking, and dipped his head in a mock bow. 'A pleasant morning for a stroll, isn't it?' he said, voice smooth and edged with curiosity. Red straightened, keeping the basket between them, and answered cautiously, 'It is. I’m just picking flowers for someone special.' The Wolf, motivated by intrigue and the tales he’d heard of the girl in red, padded closer, sniffing the air and letting the sunlight glint off his sharp teeth. He offered to show Red a hidden patch of sweeter berries, subtly testing her trust. Red, wary yet drawn by curiosity, hesitated, then shook her head and stepped back onto the path. The Wolf watched her movements, ears twitching, measuring her responses before melting back into the underbrush with a lingering glance. Their brief, guarded exchange left Red more alert as she continued her walk, while the Wolf, impressed by her caution, slunk away to plot another encounter.",
