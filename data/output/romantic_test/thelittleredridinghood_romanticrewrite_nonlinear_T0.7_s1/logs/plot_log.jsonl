Grandmother, standing at the threshold, tightened her shawl and watched him through narrowed eyes, leaning on her broom. The Wolf approached with a calculated slowness, tail low, and offered a courteous dip of his head. 'You keep an inviting home, old one,' he said, voice smooth as running water. Grandmother did not step aside but instead tapped the ground with her broom, her gaze unwavering. 'I hear many things in these woods, Wolf. Some say you’re searching for someone—perhaps a girl in red?' she said, testing the truth of the rumors. The Wolf, caught by the question, flicked his tail and sat on his haunches, feigning indifference while his eyes roved to the cottage door. 'Curiosity brings me many places,' he replied. Grandmother watched him closely, gauging his intent, and kept the door closed between them. Their exchange ended with Grandmother scattering a handful of dried sage at the threshold—a sign the Wolf was not yet welcome inside—and the Wolf retreating to the shadow of a fir tree, his curiosity about this rumored Red Riding Hood piqued. The objective of the scene is to establish the Wolf’s initial interest in Red and Grandmother’s cautious, probing welcome; the outcome is a wary truce and a spark of the Wolf’s pursuit."}}

The Wolf, emboldened, gently nuzzles her palm, and with Grandmother’s approving glance, Red leans forward and presses a brief, deliberate kiss to his brow. The Wolf blinks, tail thumping once.
