        "title": "Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House",
        "summary": "After learning Red's destination, the Wolf distracts her with a detour to pick wildflowers, then suddenly excuses himself and dashes off. Motivated by a desire to impress Red and win her trust, the Wolf aims to get to the grandmother's house before Red. Red notices his abrupt departure and decides to hurry after him, sensing something is wrong.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Wolf’s Motivation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person omniscient perspective, past tense. Introduce Wolf and Grandmother as the first characters encountered by the reader; establish their personalities and relationship from a neutral, outside view. Wolf’s curiosity and attraction to Red should be described as initial feelings, with no prior direct contact with Red. Characters must not be familiar with Red yet; Grandmother’s probing should focus on Wolf’s interest based on rumors or reputation.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin in medias res at Grandmother’s cottage, with Wolf arriving. Use subtle hints (e.g., Wolf mentioning news about Red) to foreshadow Red’s impending arrival and establish narrative intrigue."

        "title": "The Confession and the Kiss",
        "summary": "Red arrives and notices odd changes in her grandmother's cottage.

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Emotional Climax, Flashback",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person omniscient, past tense. Frame this chapter as a future event relative to the preceding chapter, using a flashforward/flashback device. Begin with a narrative reflection or a subtle time marker (e.g., 'Later, in the cottage...') to signal the temporal jump. Ensure Wolf and Red’s familiarity and emotional tension are justified by implied off-page development between chapters. Grandmother’s approving gaze should reference her previous interactions, creating continuity.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a reflective passage at the start (e.g., 'It would be some time before Red and Wolf would confront their true feelings...'), then transition into the scene. After Chapter 3’s intrigue, this chapter suggests the consequences of the earlier events."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Red’s Journey Begins",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person omniscient perspective, past tense. Offer background on Red, her mother, and the mysterious letter. This chapter re-centers the narrative focus on Red, providing essential context for her motivations, family dynamics, and the catalyst for her journey. Ensure the reader is oriented to Red’s perspective, but keep the narrative voice consistent.",
        "transition_hint": "Bridge from the previous chapter (emotional climax) with a temporal reset (e.g., 'Before all this, Red had received a letter...'). Use a line that signals a step back in time to establish chronological order."

        "title": "Red Discovers the Deception",
        "summary": "The Wolf arrives at the grandmother's cottage and convinces her to hide, claiming he wants to surprise Red.

        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "Revelation and Choice",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person omniscient, past tense. Present Red’s arrival at Grandmother’s house, her encounter with Wolf in disguise, and Grandmother’s intervention. Maintain continuity of character relationships as they would naturally develop after Red’s journey and Wolf’s earlier actions. Emotional tension between Red and Wolf should feel earned based on prior chapters.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition directly from Red’s journey (Chapter 1) with a time marker (e.g., 'By the time Red reached the cottage...'). Use the physical arrival at Grandmother’s house to anchor the narrative."

        "new_order": 5,
        "narrative_role": "First Meeting, Backward Flash",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person omniscient perspective, past tense. Present Red’s encounter with Wolf on the forest path as a flashback that fills in the missing context for their relationship. Begin with a narrative cue (e.g., 'Earlier that day, as Red took the shortcut...') to signal the jump backward in time. Character interactions should reflect unfamiliarity, with flirtation and guardedness.",
        "transition_hint": "After the tension and choices of Chapter 4, use a reflective transition such as 'Red remembered when she first met Wolf...,' then shift into the flashback of their initial encounter."
