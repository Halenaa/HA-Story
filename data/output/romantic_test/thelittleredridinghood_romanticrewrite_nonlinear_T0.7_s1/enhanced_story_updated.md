# Chapter 3: Wolf Arrives at Grandmother’s House

The Wolf, his coat glistening with dew, emerges silently from the undergrowth and circles the cottage, keenly alert for movement.

Pausing at the stone path, he inhales the aromas from Grandmother’s kitchen.

At the threshold, Grandmother, wrapped in her shawl and holding her broom, faces the Wolf with shrewd wariness.

The Wolf approaches with unhurried caution, offering a respectful nod.

Grandmother, rather than simply probing the Wolf's intentions, directly questions his purpose with pointed curiosity and subtle suspicion.

'These woods have voices of their own, Wolf.

Not every sound is meant for comfort, and not every visitor comes with kindness in their heart,' she warns.

Grandmother straightens her shawl, peering into the shadows between the trees, her eyes sharp and knowing. "These woods have voices of their own, Wolf. Not every sound is meant for comfort, and not every visitor comes with kindness in their heart." ——Grandmother

She then acknowledges the rumors about the girl in red, but claims she hasn't seen her recently, and presses the Wolf for his true motivation: 'Why are you so interested in finding her?

Grandmother leans forward, her eyes narrowing with curiosity, knitting needles pausing mid-stitch. "Ah, so you've heard the whispers too? People come and go, asking after a girl in a crimson cloak. I can't say I've seen her myself—at least, not recently. But tell me, why are you so interested in finding her? Is it worry that brings you here, or something else?" ——Grandmother

Is it worry that brings you here, or something else?

' The Wolf, caught slightly off guard by her directness, masks his intentions, keeping his answers evasive.

Both remain wary;

Grandmother keeps the door closed and the Wolf lingers in uncertainty, his curiosity about Red Riding Hood only deepening.

The scene ends with Grandmother signaling that the Wolf is not yet welcome, while the Wolf retreats, intrigued by both Grandmother's perceptiveness and the mystery surrounding Red.

----------------------------------------

As the Wolf slips away from Grandmother’s door, a sense of anticipation hangs in the air, both for him and for those he leaves behind. Red, picking up on his strange behavior, quickens her pace, her heart pounding with a mixture of worry and determination. With the forest path narrowing and dusk settling in, the stage is set for unexpected truths to surface and hidden feelings to be revealed. As Red approaches her grandmother’s house, she has no idea that the encounter awaiting her will change everything.

# Chapter 5: The Confession and the Kiss

Red, having changed out of her red cloak, pours tea with steady hands, glancing sideways at the Wolf, who sits alertly on a braided rug, his tail tucked and ears perked.

Unlike the original tense confession, the Wolf enters with open vulnerability, seeking warmth and conversation, not hiding behind bravado.

He addresses Grandmother first, assuring her of his peaceful intentions and expressing gratitude for her hospitality.

The Wolf edges closer to the foot of Grandmother's bed, offering a toothy but gentle smile, his eyes watching her intently for any sign of trust or fear. "Grandmother, please, don't be alarmed. I mean no harm; I've only come in from the cold woods, seeking a bit of warmth and perhaps a little conversation. The forest can be a lonely place, you know." ——The Wolf

Grandmother clutches her shawl a little tighter, her eyes never leaving the Wolf as she tries to gauge his intentions. "Oh, is that so? Well, you certainly startled me, but I suppose anyone might seek company on a chilly night." ——Grandmother

The Wolf steps closer to the fire, his eyes flickering with a practiced warmth as he glances at Grandmother, gauging her trust. "Of course, and I'd hate to intrude—your cozy hearth is simply so inviting, I couldn't help but be drawn in." ——The Wolf

Grandmother pulls her shawl tighter around her shoulders, casting a wary glance at The Wolf as she settles deeper into her rocking chair. "Well, if it's just warmth and words you seek, I suppose I can spare both for a traveler, though I must admit I'm still a bit uneasy." ——Grandmother

The Wolf seats himself gently by the fire, folding his paws together with a practiced air of sincerity, his eyes flickering with a subtle, concealed hunger. "Oh, Grandmother, your kindness warms me more than any fire could—please, let me set your mind at ease." ——The Wolf

GrandmotherThe Wolf offers a gentle, almost charming smile, keeping his paws folded politely, while Grandmother's eyes narrow ever so slightly, her hands tightening on the edge of her shawl. "You see, I have no claws bared nor teeth shown—only gratitude for your hospitality, dear lady." ——Grandmother

Grandmother keeps her knitting close, her hands trembling slightly as she watches The Wolf with cautious curiosity. "Still, there's something in your eyes that makes me wonder what else you might be seeking tonight." ——Grandmother

The Wolf settles onto a stool by the hearth, folding his paws neatly, his gaze gentle yet lingering on Grandmother, as if listening intently for her response. "Ah, you read me well, Grandmother—perhaps I'm seeking a story to soothe my restless spirit, for your wisdom is known throughout the woods." ——The Wolf

Grandmother narrows her eyes and folds her hands tightly in her lap, watching the Wolf with cautious suspicion. "Stories I have in plenty, but it's rare they draw such eager listeners from the wild—tell me, Wolf, what is it you truly wish to hear?" ——Grandmother

The Wolf leans forward, his tone gentle, but his gaze lingers a moment too long on Grandmother, betraying a flicker of hunger beneath his polite smile. "Only the tale of your happiest memory, Grandmother, for such light keeps the darkness at bay—even for creatures like me." ——The Wolf

Grandmother gives the Wolf a measured glance, her hands tightening around her shawl as she gestures toward the chair by the hearth. "Well, if a happy tale is all you desire, then settle in by the fire and I shall share one—but mind you, Wolf, I’ll be watching that you listen with ears and not with teeth." ——Grandmother

Grandmother, initially startled but quickly regaining her composure, offers him both warmth and wary companionship, her skepticism softened by his candor.

The Wolf lowers his head, his paws restless in the leaf litter, eyes flickering with regret as he gazes at the moonlit clearing where she once stood. "I only wished to know her heart. Strange, isn’t it? That a creature like me, forged by hunger and solitude, can ache for something so gentle, so distant. I have prowled through shadows, listened to the softest tremors in the woods, yet the quiet thrum within her chest—her thoughts, her hopes—remained a mystery to me. How could I ask? Or would she have ever answered, if she’d seen me—not as a beast, but as a soul longing for warmth? I wonder if she ever sensed my longing, or if my silence only frightened her further away." ——The Wolf

The Wolf, instead of immediately confessing his feelings for Red, requests a story from Grandmother, revealing his longing for connection and understanding through his interest in her memories and wisdom.

Grandmother, shrewd yet empathetic, agrees, inviting the Wolf closer to the fire but reminding him she remains cautious.

As Grandmother shares a happy memory, the Wolf quietly reflects aloud about his search for Red’s heart, admitting his loneliness and desire for gentleness, exposing his vulnerability in a way that shifts the mood from suspicion to tentative trust.

Red listens, her own curiosity and empathy kindled, but does not yet make a direct gesture of affection.

The rain intensifies outside, cocooning the three in a moment of growing understanding, as the Wolf’s vulnerability gently rebalances the dynamic from caution to the beginning of connection.

----------------------------------------

As the storm rumbles on, Red’s thoughts swirl with uncertainty and a fragile hope that things may not be as dire as she feared. The uneasy truce between her and the Wolf lingers as she descends the creaking steps toward the cellar, searching for answers. In the quiet that follows, a faint tap at the door pulls her attention—a subtle interruption that promises to change the course of her evening. Unbeknownst to Red, what awaits her is not just the truth about her grandmother, but a message that will cast new shadows over everything she thought she knew.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Letter

Red, wrapped in her scarlet cloak, stooped to collect eggs from the chicken coop, her boots sinking slightly into the soft, wet ground.

She paused, hearing the crunch of gravel as her mother, Maren, approached briskly, clutching a sealed, cream-colored letter.

Maren handed Red the envelope, her brows knit in concern, urging caution as she noted the unfamiliar seal.

Together, they scrutinized the symbol, which resembled a twisted wolf's head, heightening their anxiety.

Maren drew the curtains with a sharp tug as they entered the kitchen, both wary of prying eyes.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red runs her thumb gently across the wax, her brow furrowing as she studies the intricate symbol. She glances up at her mother, voice low and cautious, the air between them tense with shared uncertainty. "This seal. I've never seen it before, Mother. The mark—it's nothing like ours, or the village's. Who would send us something like this, and why?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red’s MotherShe steps beside Red, squinting at the seal, her hands hovering protectively near her daughter's shoulder. "Careful, Red—don't break it just yet; let me see that symbol closer, for sometimes secrets hide in plain sight." ——Red’s Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red holds the envelope up to the lantern light, her brow furrowed, while Maren edges closer, her hand hovering protectively near Red's shoulder. "It almost looks like a wolf's head, but twisted somehow—do you think it's a warning, or a summons?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red’s MotherShe leans in, squinting at the seal, her hand hovering protectively over Red's shoulder. "A wolf's head, you say? Then we must tread even more lightly, for old enemies have long memories—and sometimes messages are meant for eyes other than our own." ——Red’s Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps back from the table, clutching her cloak tighter, eyes flickering between the seal and her mother's worried face. "Maybe we should wait until dawn, when the shadows are thinner—if this is a threat, I’d rather face it in the light." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red expressed her curiosity and apprehension, debating whether to open the letter at dawn, when shadows are thinner, but her impatience overcame her hesitation and she broke the seal, discovering the letter addressed to her.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red carefully unfolds the letter, glancing up at Maren’s furrowed brow and anxious hands hovering near her shoulder, feeling the weight of both anticipation and her mother’s worry. "The seal’s broken—look, Mother, it’s addressed to me. I have to know what’s inside. What if it’s something important?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red’s MotherMaren reaches out, gently placing a hand over Red’s wrist, her eyes searching Red’s face for hesitation. "Red, wait—sometimes secrets are kept for a reason, and not all truths are meant to be uncovered so quickly." ——Red’s Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans closer to the parchment, her fingers trembling with anticipation, while Maren’s hand hovers protectively over Red’s shoulder, eyes narrowed in worry. "But I’ve waited so long for answers; don’t you want to know, too?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red’s MotherMaren gently places her hand over Red's, her eyes searching Red's face for hesitation even as the letter trembles between their fingers. "Of course I want to know, darling, but I worry what the truth might cost you." ——Red’s Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans in, fingers trembling with anticipation as she carefully unfolds the letter, her eyes darting to Maren’s anxious face. "I can’t help it, Mother—the words are almost leaping off the page; I feel like they’re meant for me alone." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red’s MotherMaren gently places her hand over Red’s, her eyes flickering with both fear and fierce love as she braces herself for whatever revelations the letter holds. "I know your heart is racing, Red, but let me stand with you as you read—whatever’s inside, we’ll face it together." ——Red’s Mother

Maren, concerned for her daughter's safety but unable to quell Red's curiosity, insisted on standing by her side as she read, determined to face whatever secrets the letter might hold together.

----------------------------------------

As the last words of the letter settled heavily between them, Red felt the weight of her decision pressing closer. With her mind swirling with questions and her resolve hardening, she stepped beyond the threshold of her home, unaware that each step toward her grandmother’s cottage would bring her deeper into a web of deception she had yet to unravel.

# Chapter 4: Red Discovers the Deception

Red, her cloak damp from the forest, steps onto the creaking porch and knocks with brittle knuckles, clutching a basket of warm bread.

The Wolf, concealed beneath Grandmother's quilt and wearing her cap, calls out in a low, gravelly imitation of the old woman's voice, inviting Red inside.

The Wolf, hidden beneath Grandmother's quilt and cap, pulls the covers up to shadow his face, attempting to soften his gruff voice as he beckons Red nearer with a crooked, clawed hand barely concealed by the blanket. "Come in, dear child, the door is open. I've been waiting for you—do come closer so I can see you better." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps hesitantly into the dim room, clutching her basket, peering toward the figure beneath the covers. "Grandmother, your voice sounds so strange—are you feeling very unwell?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lifts a trembling paw, beckoning Red gently closer while keeping most of his face shadowed beneath the quilt. "Oh, my sweet, the cold has settled deep in my throat—come nearer, and you'll see it's truly me." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps hesitantly toward the bed, peering closely at the figure beneath the covers. "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf shifts beneath the covers, peering intently at Red with wide, glinting eyes, beckoning her closer with a trembling hand. "The better to see you with, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a cautious step closer, her brow furrowing as she peers through the dim light at the figure in bed. "Grandmother, what big ears you have!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf nestles deeper beneath the quilt, angling his head to keep Red's gaze fixed on his face as he pats the bed invitingly. "The better to hear you with, my child." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red inches closer to the bed, her brow furrowing as she stares at the large, clawed hands resting atop the quilt. "Grandmother, what big hands you have!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf stretches out a clawed hand from beneath the quilt, beckoning Red nearer with an unsettling smile. "The better to hold you close, my dear." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red takes a hesitant step closer, her eyes wide with uncertainty as she studies the teeth peeking out from beneath the quilt. "Grandmother, what a big mouth you have!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf throws off the quilt, leaping toward Red with a menacing snarl. "The better to eat you with, my dear!" ——The Wolf

Red enters, her boots leaving muddy prints on the woven rug, and sets her basket on the table, pausing as she studies the unfamiliar silhouette in the bed.

The Wolf shifts, tucking his paws beneath the covers and adjusting the cap, eyes glinting from beneath the shadow.

Red, recalling Grandmother's sharp features, questions the odd shape and voice, leaning closer and brushing the quilt with her fingers.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans in, squinting, her fingers nervously tracing the edge of the quilt as she studies the figure in the bed, her brow furrowed in concern and suspicion. "Grandmother, are you feeling alright? Your. nose looks so much longer than I remember. And your voice—it sounds so rough. Is something the matter?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf adjusts the cap lower over his brow, attempting a feeble, wheezy chuckle, while tucking the end of the quilt tighter under his chin. "Oh, my dear, it's just a little cold making my voice hoarse, and as for my nose—why, I suppose that's what happens with age; it helps me smell your lovely baking all the better." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans in closer, her eyes narrowing as she studies the Wolf's head under the quilt. "But Grandmother, your ears seem much larger too—did they always stick out like that?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf shifts beneath the quilt, angling his head so his oversized ears are less obvious, forcing a trembling smile. "All the better to hear you with, my dear—these old ears must catch every soft word you say." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans in, narrowing her eyes, her hand hesitating above the quilt as she peers closer at the Wolf's unsettling gaze. "And your eyes—they look so big and bright, almost as if they're glowing in this dim light; have they always been like that?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf blinks slowly, drawing the covers higher while watching Red's face for any sign of suspicion. "Why, my dear, that's just so I can see you more clearly, even in the shadowy room—old eyes need every bit of help they can get." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitantly reaches out, her fingers trembling as she gently touches 'Grandmother's' hand, her eyes narrowing in suspicion. "Grandmother, your hands—they're so large and covered with coarse hair; I don't remember them ever looking so. wild." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf quickly tucks his hairy hands deeper beneath the quilt, attempting to hide them from Red's scrutinizing gaze. "Oh, my dear, these hands have simply grown strong from years of kneading dough and tending the fire—nothing to worry about." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, her fingers hovering just above the quilt as she leans closer, eyes fixed on the gleaming teeth. "But Grandmother, your teeth—they're so sharp and pointed, nothing like the gentle smile I remember." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Instead of Grandmother intervening at this moment, Red grows increasingly suspicious, directly challenging the Wolf and ultimately exposing him herself.

Pressed by Red's courage, the Wolf confesses his deception and admits to being driven by hunger, but also voices regret.

When Red demands her grandmother's whereabouts, the Wolf reveals that Grandmother is unharmed and locked in the wardrobe.

Red compels the Wolf to release her, and Grandmother emerges, wary but unharmed.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands rigid at the foot of the bed, fists clenched, voice trembling between fear and fury as she glares at the Wolf, demanding an answer. "Enough! I know you're not my grandmother. Who are you, and what have you done with her? Tell me the truth—right now!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his head, his voice trembling between guilt and hunger, as his disguise slips away. "All right, Red—no more lies; I am the Wolf, and I tricked you because I was hungry, but your courage has forced me to admit it." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red backs away, fists clenched, glaring at the Wolf with a mix of terror and fury. "Hungry? You mean you would hurt my grandmother—and me—just to satisfy yourself?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his head, his voice trembling with shame as he avoids Red's fierce gaze. "Yes, I was desperate and let my hunger blind me to everything else, but seeing your bravery now, I regret what I've done." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps forward, her voice trembling but determined, glaring at the Wolf and refusing to back down. "Regret isn't enough—you need to tell me where my grandmother is and help me fix what you've done!" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf steps back from Red, raising his claws in surrender, and gestures shakily towards the wardrobe. "She's locked in the wardrobe—unharmed, I swear—I'll open it and let her out if you promise not to scream." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands firm, her fists clenched, eyes never leaving the Wolf as she gestures sharply toward the wardrobe. "I'll stay quiet, but you open that wardrobe now—if you hurt her, you'll answer to me." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf pads over to the wardrobe, his claws trembling, and slowly swings the door open to reveal Red's grandmother, frightened but unharmed, inside. "Very well, Red—I'll open it now, and you can see she's safe." ——The Wolf

The Wolf slowly opens the wardrobe, stepping back as Red rushes to embrace her grandmother, relief and anger mixing on her face. "See for yourself—your grandmother is unharmed, and I am truly sorry for frightening you both." ——The Wolf

Grandmother, protective, bars the door and keeps Red close, but allows the Wolf to explain himself after Red insists on hearing his side.

Grandmother stands firmly before the barred door, her arms crossed protectively over her chest. She gestures for Red to sit close, her gaze never leaving the Wolf, who sits hunched by the hearth. "Well, that's settled for now. The door stays shut, and no one crosses my threshold uninvited—beast or man. Red, come sit beside me, away from him. I've lived too long to trust a wolf with soft words, no matter how sorry he looks. My only hope is to keep you safe, child, even if it means a heart grown suspicious." ——Grandmother

The WolfRed hesitates in the middle of the room, glancing between Grandmother and the Wolf, her hands clenching and unclenching at her sides. "Red: But Grandmother, if we only listen to what frightens us, how will we ever know what truly lies beneath the fur—or the fear?" ——The Wolf

The Wolf lowers his head, ears flattened, his eyes pleading as he sits near the hearth, keeping a wary distance from Grandmother and Red. "Wolf: I never asked to be the villain in your stories; hunger drove me here, not hatred—if you hear me out, perhaps you’ll see more than just my teeth." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red edges forward, her eyes searching the Wolf's face for truth, while her hand remains close to Grandmother's. "Wolf, I am listening—tell me, if you could choose differently, would you still prowl these woods for prey, or is there more to your hunger than teeth and shadow?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes flickering with regret, while Grandmother grips Red’s hand tighter, her gaze unwavering and wary. "Wolf: If I could choose, I’d trade hunger for peace; but when the cold bites deeper than conscience, even a wolf dreams of forgiveness." ——The Wolf

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red sits between the hearth and the barred door, glancing from Grandmother’s stern face to the Wolf’s lowered eyes, her fingers nervously tracing the edge of her red cloak as she weighs their words. "Grandmother, I hear your fears, and Wolf, I sense your regret—if I must decide your fate, let it be with eyes wide open to both the danger and the desperation before me." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

The chapter ends with Red, having confronted both danger and compassion, preparing to decide the Wolf's fate, guided by both her grandmother's caution and her own empathy.

----------------------------------------

As the uneasy silence settles within the cottage, Red’s heart remains heavy with uncertainty, her mind replaying the tension of the confrontation. Yet, even as she seeks answers within the familiar walls, an unexpected presence stirs just beyond the threshold, heralding the arrival of someone entirely new. The path ahead, once shadowed by deception, now beckons her toward a stranger whose charm promises both intrigue and unforeseen consequences.

# Chapter 2: Red Meets the Charming Stranger

Red, gripping the woven basket at her side, paused to adjust her crimson cloak and scan the undergrowth for the shortcut to her grandmother’s cottage.

She crouched to inspect a cluster of wild violets, intent on gathering them for her grandmother.

Suddenly, a large, gray-furred Wolf emerged from the shadows, his amber eyes fixed on Red.

The Wolf circled just beyond arm’s reach, tail flicking, and dipped his head in a mock bow.

'A pleasant morning for a stroll, isn't it?

' he said, voice smooth and edged with curiosity.

Red straightened, keeping the basket between them, and answered cautiously, 'It is.

I’m just picking flowers for someone special.

' The Wolf, motivated by intrigue and the tales he’d heard of the girl in red, padded closer, sniffing the air and letting the sunlight glint off his sharp teeth.

The Wolf crouches low in the underbrush, amber eyes fixed on the distant figure, ears twitching to catch every soft footstep, tail flicking with anticipation. "Ah, there she is at last—the famous girl in red. So much chatter in the woods about her innocence, her sweetness… I wonder how much truth there really is to those tales. She walks as though she’s never known fear, as if the world is her own gentle garden. How curious—and how tempting. What secrets might she reveal to a clever tongue? Or perhaps, what delight might there be in unraveling her story myself?" ——The Wolf

The Wolf slinks closer behind a thicket, ears pricked, his gaze fixed hungrily on the girl in red. "Perhaps a little conversation will loosen her guard, let me peer into the depths behind those bright eyes." ——The Wolf

He offered to show Red a hidden patch of sweeter berries, subtly testing her trust.

Red, wary yet drawn by curiosity, hesitated, then shook her head and stepped back onto the path.

The Wolf watched her movements, ears twitching, measuring her responses before melting back into the underbrush with a lingering glance.

Their brief, guarded exchange left Red more alert as she continued her walk, while the Wolf, impressed by her caution, slunk away to plot another encounter.

----------------------------------------

As Red disappeared beneath the canopy’s dappled light, the woods settled into a hush, holding close the secrets of a morning when innocence and cunning met—and parted, each changed in ways the forest alone would remember.
