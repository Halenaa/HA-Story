Red nods, adjusting her crimson cloak, and glances toward the deeper woods. Luc steps closer, eyes scanning the shadows, and offers to walk with her. Red hesitates, weighing his offer, and replies, 'I can manage.' Luc studies her, then reaches down to pick up a fallen branch, tossing it aside to clear the way. Their footsteps crunch on the path as Red leads, Luc following protectively, both listening for movement among the trees. Luc’s motivation is to keep Red safe; Red is determined to prove she can travel independently. The result: Red accepts Luc's presence but maintains her lead, setting the stage for further tension.",

He flicks his ears and lets out a low, coaxing growl, trying to draw Red closer to the ferns. Suddenly, Luc bursts from the thicket, axe in hand, boots thudding against tree roots. He places himself between Red and the Wolf, his shoulders squared, voice low and steady: 'Back away, Wolf. You’ve had your fun.' The Wolf bares his teeth, but instead of lunging, he paces backward, glancing at Red for a cue. Red, jaw set, steps forward beside Luc, her voice firm: 'He means no harm—let me speak.' Luc glances at her, torn between trust and duty, and lowers his axe a fraction. The Wolf sniffs the air, tension rippling through his body as he waits. Luc’s intervention halts the Wolf’s advance and forces a standoff, but Red’s intervention opens a tense dialogue between the three. The rustle of wind in the undergrowth and the distant crack of a branch underscore the fragile peace, as all three weigh their next moves.",
