Luc’s internal dialogue reveals a deeper emotional motivation and sense of duty, also stronger than the original. The updated plot reflects this increased collaboration and emotional openness between Red and Luc.",

The Wolf expresses suspicion and wariness, not curiosity or playful banter with Red. The plot has been updated to match the Wolf's solitary, tense encounter, removing Red's appearance and the bread-sharing moment. This maintains character logic and sets up future interactions.",

Red, Luc, and the Wolf each reveal or allude to personal secrets and deeper intentions, shifting the narrative from a direct conflict to a mystery and alliance against something darker. The plot is updated to reflect this expanded focus on secrets, mutual questioning, and the emergence of a potential new antagonist in the woods.",
