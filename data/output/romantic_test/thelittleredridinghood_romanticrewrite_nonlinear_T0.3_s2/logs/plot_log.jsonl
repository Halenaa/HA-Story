'Lost, are you?' he drawls, voice rough like gravel. Red straightens, meeting his gaze without flinching. 'Not lost. Just passing through,' she replies, her grip tightening on the basket handle. The Wolf paces closer, paws sinking into the leaf mold, then sits back on his haunches, ears pricked in curiosity. He sniffs at the basket. 'Smells better than squirrel,' he says.

Red ladles soup into a bowl, her hands steady, but she asks pointedly about Granny's 'changed voice' and 'big hands,' her tone light but her gaze unwavering. The Wolf, motivated to maintain his disguise and win Red's trust, responds with a raspy explanation about a cold and old age, forcing a cough and clutching the blanket tighter. As Red hands over the bowl, she brushes her fingers against the Wolf's paw, feeling the coarse fur beneath the glove, and subtly pulls back. The rain outside grows heavier, masking the tension in the room as Red, motivated by suspicion and a need for proof, edges toward the window, pretending to adjust the curtains while keeping the Wolf in sight. The scene ends with the Wolf sipping the soup, eyes following Red warily, both locked in a silent contest of vigilance."}}

Inside, Granny paused her knitting, set her needles aside, and approached the door with measured steps, cane tapping on the worn planks. She cracked the door open, squinting through the gloom, her voice sly and steady: 'Not many visitors come by this early—what brings a wolf to my doorstep?' Wolf dipped his head, baring a practiced, nonthreatening grin, and replied, 'I've heard tales of your wisdom, old one. I come seeking advice for a friend lost in the woods.'
