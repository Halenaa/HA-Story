        "summary": "Red faces a decision: reprimand the Wolf for his trick or forgive him and explore their connection. After a tense moment, she chooses to forgive, on the condition that the Wolf makes amends to Grandma. The Wolf agrees, and the three share a meal, marking the start of an unexpected friendship—and the hint of romance between Red and the Wolf.",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Initial mystery setup",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open with third person omniscient perspective, present tense for immediacy. Characters must be introduced as if meeting for the first time; use indirect exposition to establish Red, Luc, the Wolf, and Granny’s identities and relationships for the reader. Avoid presuming prior knowledge or familiarity. Use subtle narrative cues to hint at unresolved past events, setting up intrigue for later flashbacks.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin in media res with Red confronting Luc and the Wolf. Briefly pause action with internal narration to introduce each character and their motivations, inviting curiosity about how these dynamics came to be."

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Backstory flashback",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person omniscient perspective, past tense to signal time shift. Frame this chapter as a flashback, triggered by Red’s reflection or the Wolf’s confession from previous chapter. Show characters meeting for the first time; Red and the Wolf display curiosity and subtle flirtation, but no prior connection.",
        "transition_hint": "Seamlessly transition by having Red recall her first encounter with the Wolf or narratively cue a shift in time (e.g., 'Earlier that day...'). Use sensory or emotional triggers linking the confrontation to the memory."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Background exposition",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person omniscient perspective, past tense. Narrate Red’s mission from her mother as a direct backstory following the prior flashback. Ensure Red’s motivations, family relationships, and desire to attend the dance are clearly established, supplementing character context introduced earlier.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition by having Red’s recollection of her mother’s warning or a narrative device such as 'To understand Red’s journey, we must begin at her home...'. Connect emotional stakes from previous chapter to her current determination."

        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "Suspense development",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue with third person omniscient perspective, present tense for heightened suspense. Red’s suspicion toward ‘Granny’ must be consistent with her cautious, observant nature established earlier; their relationship should reflect this growing doubt, not prior confrontation.",
        "transition_hint": "Move naturally from Red’s determined journey (previous chapter) into her arrival at Granny’s cottage. Use environmental cues (e.g., change in scenery, mood shift) to guide the reader into the new setting."

        "narrative_role": "Romantic subplot expansion",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue with third person omniscient perspective, past tense for clarity. Luc’s introduction as Woodsman must feel organic; his flirtation and protective instincts toward Red should align with her independent spirit. Relationships should reflect early-stage attraction, not deep familiarity.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition by recalling Red’s thoughts about Luc as she nears the cottage, or by narratively looping back to her journey through the forest (‘Earlier, as Red walked...’). Use soft temporal cues to stitch together the timeline."

Character relationships (Red, Luc, Wolf, Granny) should reflect the buildup of tension and prior events. Luc’s intervention must feel like a culmination of his protective role; Red’s aid and their mutual attraction should be apparent but not prematurely resolved.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition directly from prior chapter’s suspense and Luc’s following of Red. Use urgent sensory cues (e.g., footsteps, raised voices) to propel the reader into the confrontation."
