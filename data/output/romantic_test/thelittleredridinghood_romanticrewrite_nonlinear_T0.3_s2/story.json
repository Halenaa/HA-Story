Luc, axe slung over his shoulder, emerges from behind an oak, boots scraping against gravel. He calls out, 'You're heading to the cottage?' Red nods, adjusting her crimson cloak, and glances toward the deeper woods. Luc steps closer, eyes scanning the shadows, and offers to walk with her. Red hesitates, weighing his offer, and replies, 'I can manage.' Luc studies her, then reaches down to pick up a fallen branch, tossing it aside to clear the way. Their footsteps crunch on the path as Red leads, Luc following protectively, both listening for movement among the trees. Luc’s motivation is to keep Red safe; Red is determined to prove she can travel independently. The result: Red accepts Luc's presence but maintains her lead, setting the stage for further tension.",

She pauses to examine a cluster of mushrooms, plucking one for her basket, when a low rustle emerges from behind a fallen log. The Wolf, his mottled gray coat streaked with mud, circles the log, tail flicking as he blocks the path ahead. He lowers his head and sniffs the air, eyes fixed on Red. 'Lost, are you?' he drawls, voice rough like gravel. Red straightens, meeting his gaze without flinching. 'Not lost. Just passing through,' she replies, her grip tightening on the basket handle. The Wolf paces closer, paws sinking into the leaf mold, then sits back on his haunches, ears pricked in curiosity. He sniffs at the basket. 'Smells better than squirrel,' he says. Red takes a careful step sideways, eyeing the woods for another route, but does not retreat. She offers, 'If you’re hungry, there’s enough bread to share.' The Wolf’s whiskers twitch in surprise; he tilts his head, considering the offer, but lets her pass, brushing his tail along her boots as she steps by. Their eyes meet once more before Red disappears down the path, and the Wolf lingers in her wake, nose twitching at the lingering scent of bread and wild rosemary.",

Her mother, voice steady but eyes lingering on the window, instructs Red to deliver the basket and letter to Granny, who has fallen ill in her cottage deep in the woods. She cautions Red, pointing to the edge of the forest visible through the window, reminding her to stay on the marked path and not speak to strangers. Red listens, but her gaze keeps drifting to the invitation pinned on the mantel—a hand-lettered card for the village dance that evening, which she yearns to attend. Red’s mother presses the basket into her daughter’s hands, squeezing her fingers with urgency, reminding her to return before nightfall. Red nods, hefts the basket, and steps out the creaking door, the scent of dew-soaked grass rising as she sets her boots on the narrow woodland trail, determined to complete her errand swiftly and prove her responsibility so she might earn permission to attend the dance.",

She glances at the bed, noting how the blankets are pulled high and Granny's cap is set oddly askew. The Wolf, hidden beneath the covers, adjusts the cap with a careful paw, mimicking Granny's voice as he greets her. Red sets the basket down on the table and moves closer, sniffing the air, her brows knitting at the unfamiliar scent. She leans in, ostensibly to check Granny's temperature, but her eyes linger on the shape of the hands and the glint of sharp teeth barely concealed by the quilt. The Wolf, sensing her scrutiny, pulls the blanket higher, feigning a shiver and asking for the soup Red has brought. Red ladles soup into a bowl, her hands steady, but she asks pointedly about Granny's 'changed voice' and 'big hands,' her tone light but her gaze unwavering. The Wolf, motivated to maintain his disguise and win Red's trust, responds with a raspy explanation about a cold and old age, forcing a cough and clutching the blanket tighter. As Red hands over the bowl, she brushes her fingers against the Wolf's paw, feeling the coarse fur beneath the glove, and subtly pulls back. The rain outside grows heavier, masking the tension in the room as Red, motivated by suspicion and a need for proof, edges toward the window, pretending to adjust the curtains while keeping the Wolf in sight. The scene ends with the Wolf sipping the soup, eyes following Red warily, both locked in a silent contest of vigilance.",

His nose twitched, catching the aroma of baking bread and herbal salves seeping from the cracks in the shutters. Driven by his desire to impress Red and test the humans' cleverness, he padded to the doorstep and tapped the door with a calculated gentleness. Inside, Granny paused her knitting, set her needles aside, and approached the door with measured steps, cane tapping on the worn planks. She cracked the door open, squinting through the gloom, her voice sly and steady: 'Not many visitors come by this early—what brings a wolf to my doorstep?' Wolf dipped his head, baring a practiced, nonthreatening grin, and replied, 'I've heard tales of your wisdom, old one. I come seeking advice for a friend lost in the woods.' Granny studied him, her sharp gaze lingering on his twitching ears, then stepped back, gesturing him in. As Wolf crossed the threshold, he brushed against a hanging sprig of lavender and scanned the cozy room for signs of Red's imminent arrival, his tail flicking with anticipation. Their exchange set the stage: Granny, wary yet intrigued, offered him a seat by the fire, while Wolf, ever watchful, positioned himself to observe both door and window, already plotting his next move.",

He clears his throat to announce his presence, then gestures toward the mushrooms, warning her with a low, steady voice about their poisonous nature. Red stands, brushing dirt from her skirt, and responds with a wry smile, explaining she recognizes the species. Luc, motivated by concern and a desire to prove his knowledge, kneels beside her and points out a safer path, tracing it with a thick twig. He invites her to walk with him deeper into the woods, suggesting he knows a shortcut to her grandmother’s cottage. Red hesitates briefly, scanning the shifting shadows, then nods and matches his pace, her steps deliberate as she balances her independence with a willingness to accept Luc’s guidance. The two set off side by side, their conversation punctuated by the rhythmic crunch of twigs, and their path gradually narrowing beneath overhanging branches.",

He flicks his ears and lets out a low, coaxing growl, trying to draw Red closer to the ferns. Suddenly, Luc bursts from the thicket, axe in hand, boots thudding against tree roots. He places himself between Red and the Wolf, his shoulders squared, voice low and steady: 'Back away, Wolf. You’ve had your fun.' The Wolf bares his teeth, but instead of lunging, he paces backward, glancing at Red for a cue. Red, jaw set, steps forward beside Luc, her voice firm: 'He means no harm—let me speak.' Luc glances at her, torn between trust and duty, and lowers his axe a fraction. The Wolf sniffs the air, tension rippling through his body as he waits. Luc’s intervention halts the Wolf’s advance and forces a standoff, but Red’s intervention opens a tense dialogue between the three. The rustle of wind in the undergrowth and the distant crack of a branch underscore the fragile peace, as all three weigh their next moves.",
