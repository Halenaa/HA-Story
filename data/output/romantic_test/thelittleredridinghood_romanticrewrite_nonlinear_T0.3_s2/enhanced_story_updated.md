# Chapter 7: Truths and Choices Revealed

Red steps onto the narrow path with her basket, determined to reach her grandmother’s cottage and demonstrate her independence.

Luc, axe over his shoulder, emerges from behind an oak and offers to accompany her, warning of the woods’ dangers.

Unlike before, Red now actively invites Luc to stay close, recognizing the risks of the journey and accepting his protective presence more willingly.

Luc reassures her, expressing his sense of duty and deeper emotional investment in her safety.

Red acknowledges her desire to prove herself capable but also admits to feeling the weight of others’ concerns.

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc steps just within the edge of moonlight, his hand resting on the worn leather strap of his satchel, eyes alert as he surveys the shifting darkness between the trees. "It's not wise to wander these woods alone, especially with night so close. I can walk with you, if you'd like. The forest isn't always kind to strangers." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

The two proceed together, Red remaining alert but leaning more on Luc’s support and experience, deepening their mutual trust and setting the stage for future challenges and evolving dynamics between independence and companionship.

----------------------------------------

As the shadows lengthen and the forest seems to close in around them, Red and Luc move forward, their footsteps weaving new paths through uncertainty and hope. The peace of shared understanding lingers, yet the woods remain unpredictable—each moment heavy with possibility. Just as Red begins to trust the quiet, the world shifts once more, drawing her toward an encounter she cannot foresee but will not be able to ignore.

# Chapter 3: A Chance Meeting with the Wolf

Red is not present in this scene as described in the dialogue.

Instead, the Wolf is alone in the woods, sensing an unfamiliar presence nearby.

He becomes increasingly wary, speaking aloud to the unseen watcher, suspecting either an old fox or a stranger with unusual cunning.

The Wolf’s monologue reveals his vulnerability and heightened senses as he tries to identify the intruder, who remains hidden.

The encounter ends without Red appearing;

the Wolf remains unsettled and alert, foreshadowing a future meeting with a character whose presence challenges him.

----------------------------------------

As the forest settles once more into uneasy silence, the Wolf disappears among the shadows, his mind still tangled with questions and anticipation. Meanwhile, beyond the tangled woods and far from the Wolf’s watchful gaze, Red’s own story is quietly unfolding. Not yet aware of the creature trailing her path, she is about to set out from home, guided by her mother’s gentle instructions and a sense of purpose that will soon draw her into the heart of the forest’s secrets.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mission from Her Mother

Red stands at the kitchen table, tying the red cloak beneath her chin as her mother packs a woven basket with fresh bread, a jar of honey, and a folded letter.

Her mother, voice steady but eyes lingering on the window, instructs Red to deliver the basket and letter to Granny, who has fallen ill in her cottage deep in the woods.

Red’s MotherMother hands Red the basket, her voice calm but her gaze drifts anxiously to the view beyond the window, fingers tightening around the folded letter. "Red, I need you to take this basket and the letter to your grandmother right away. She’s not feeling well, and I’m worried about her being all alone in that cottage so far out. Please go straight there, and don’t dawdle on the path. Promise me you’ll be careful." ——Red’s Mother

Red takes the basket with both hands, glancing from her mother’s anxious face to the shadowed woods beyond the window. "I promise, Mother—I’ll go straight there and bring Granny whatever she needs." ——Red

She cautions Red, pointing to the edge of the forest visible through the window, reminding her to stay on the marked path and not speak to strangers.

Red’s Mother glances anxiously toward the edge of the forest, her voice firm but caring, as she places a gentle hand on Red’s shoulder. "Red, before you go, remember what I’ve always told you: stay on the marked path. Don’t wander off, no matter what you see or hear. And whatever you do, never speak to strangers—there are dangers in those woods that you can’t imagine." ——Red’s Mother

Red nods earnestly, glancing out the window toward the shadowy line of trees. "I understand, Mother—I’ll keep to the path and won’t talk to anyone I don’t know, I promise." ——Red

Red listens attentively and reassures her mother with repeated promises not to stray from the path nor speak to anyone she does not know, showing her determination to follow instructions and her sense of responsibility.

Red’s mother presses the basket into her daughter’s hands, squeezing her fingers with urgency, reminding her to return before nightfall.

Red’s MotherShe presses the basket into Red’s hands, her fingers lingering for a moment as she meets her daughter’s eyes, voice trembling with urgency. "Red, take this basket and hold it tight. Promise me you’ll go straight there and come straight home—no wandering, do you hear? The woods change after sunset, and it’s not safe. You must be back before nightfall, no matter what." ——Red’s Mother

Red clutches the basket to her chest, meeting her mother’s anxious gaze with a solemn nod. "I promise, Mama—I’ll hurry and won’t stray from the path, I swear." ——Red

Red nods, hefts the basket, and steps out the creaking door, the scent of dew-soaked grass rising as she sets her boots on the narrow woodland trail, determined to complete her errand swiftly and prove her responsibility.

This time, Red’s focus remains firmly on her task, her yearning for the village dance tempered by her promises to her mother.

----------------------------------------

As Red moves deeper into the woods, the hush of morning is broken only by the crunch of twigs beneath her boots and the distant call of birds overhead. Each step away from home sharpens her awareness of the shadows gathering beneath the trees, and she finds herself glancing over her shoulder, recalling her mother’s warnings. Despite her resolve, a faint unease begins to settle within her, growing with every rustle in the underbrush and every unfamiliar sound echoing through the forest.

# Chapter 5: Red’s Suspicion Grows

Red steps over the threshold, her boots squeaking on the warped floorboards, a wicker basket clutched tightly in her hand.

She glances at the bed, noting how the blankets are pulled high and Granny's cap is set oddly askew.

The Wolf, hidden beneath the covers, adjusts the cap with a careful paw, mimicking Granny's voice as he greets her.

WolfThe Wolf tucks the covers higher under his chin, peering out with wide, eager eyes, and forces his voice into a soft, quavery imitation of Granny's gentle tone, though a note of impatience slips in at the end. "Come in, dearie, come in! My, my, what a surprise to see you so early. The door's unlocked—just give it a gentle push, won't you, child?" ——Wolf

Red sets the basket down on the table and moves closer, sniffing the air, her brows knitting at the unfamiliar scent.

She leans in, ostensibly to check Granny's temperature, but her eyes linger on the shape of the hands and the glint of sharp teeth barely concealed by the quilt.

The Wolf, sensing her scrutiny, pulls the blanket higher, feigning a shiver and asking for the soup Red has brought.

WolfThe Wolf huddles deeper under the blanket, giving a convincing shiver, and peers up at Red with watery, pleading eyes. "Oh, dear child, is that you? My, what a chill has crept into these old bones. Have you brought the soup, as I hoped? Would you be so kind as to come closer and set it by my bedside? My hands are quite unsteady today." ——Wolf

Red ladles soup into a bowl, her hands steady, but she asks pointedly about Granny's 'changed voice' and 'big hands,' her tone light but her gaze unwavering.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red carefully ladles soup into Granny’s bowl, her hands steady, eyes flicking up to study Granny’s face as she speaks. She offers a gentle smile, but there’s a sharpness in her gaze that belies her casual tone. "Granny, is your throat feeling alright today? Your voice sounds. different, a bit rougher than I remember. Have you caught a cold?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf, motivated to maintain his disguise and win Red's trust, responds with a raspy explanation about a cold and old age, forcing a cough and clutching the blanket tighter.

WolfThe Wolf pulls the blanket up to his chin, lets out a wheezy cough, and gives a weak, trembling smile, trying to appear frail and harmless. "Oh, my dear, it's just this dreadful cold and the years catching up with me. My voice isn't what it used to be—ah-hem—nor is my poor, tired body. That's why I look so strange and sound so rough today. Come closer, child, so I don't have to strain myself." ——Wolf

As Red hands over the bowl, she brushes her fingers against the Wolf's paw, feeling the coarse fur beneath the glove, and subtly pulls back.

The rain outside grows heavier, masking the tension in the room as Red, motivated by suspicion and a need for proof, edges toward the window, pretending to adjust the curtains while keeping the Wolf in sight.

The scene ends with the Wolf sipping the soup, eyes following Red warily, both locked in a silent contest of vigilance.

----------------------------------------

Unspoken questions hang in the thick air as the storm deepens, each roll of thunder echoing the uncertainty between them. Yet outside these walls, the path that led the Wolf here begins to unravel, carrying its own secrets and shadows toward Granny’s cottage. As Red and the Wolf measure each other's intentions, the story rewinds, tracing pawprints back through the forest, to the moment the Wolf first approached the quiet, unsuspecting home at the edge of the woods.

# Chapter 4: Wolf Arrives at Granny's Cottage

Wolf prowled around the edge of the clearing, his paws silent on the leaf-littered ground as he circled the cottage, testing the wind for unfamiliar scents.

His nose twitched, catching the aroma of baking bread and herbal salves seeping from the cracks in the shutters.

Driven by his desire to impress Red and test the humans' cleverness, he padded to the doorstep and tapped the door with a calculated gentleness.

Inside, Granny paused her knitting, set her needles aside, and approached the door with measured steps, cane tapping on the worn planks.

She cracked the door open, squinting through the gloom, her voice sly and steady: 'Not many visitors come by this early—what brings a wolf to my doorstep?

' Wolf dipped his head, baring a practiced, nonthreatening grin, and replied, 'I've heard tales of your wisdom, old one.

I come seeking advice for a friend lost in the woods.

' Granny studied him, her sharp gaze lingering on his twitching ears, then stepped back, gesturing him in.

As Wolf crossed the threshold, he brushed against a hanging sprig of lavender and scanned the cozy room for signs of Red's imminent arrival, his tail flicking with anticipation.

Their exchange set the stage: Granny, wary yet intrigued, offered him a seat by the fire, while Wolf, ever watchful, positioned himself to observe both door and window, already plotting his next move.

----------------------------------------

Outside, the afternoon sun filtered through the dense trees, casting shifting shadows along the winding path Red would soon follow. As the Wolf settled into his borrowed disguise within the cottage, fate was already weaving a new encounter in the forest beyond. Not far from the cottage’s doorstep, Red paused on her journey, unaware of the ruse awaiting her and of the unexpected figure she was about to meet among the whispering pines.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Mysterious Woodsman

Red steps off the worn footpath, basket swinging at her side, pausing to examine a cluster of scarlet mushrooms growing beneath a fallen log.

As she crouches to inspect them, Luc emerges from behind a mossy tree, axe slung over his shoulder, boots crunching on the soil.

He clears his throat to announce his presence, then gestures toward the mushrooms, warning her with a low, steady voice about their poisonous nature.

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc clears his throat to get Red's attention, then points with his axe handle toward a cluster of mushrooms edging the path, his voice low and sure. "Careful where you step, Red. Those mushrooms there—see the red caps with white spots? They're poison. Even a touch can make you sick." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates mid-step, pulling her foot back and peering at Luc with wide-eyed curiosity. "Oh—I had no idea they were so dangerous; how do you know so much about them?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc kneels beside the mushrooms, pointing out crushed earth where a small animal once lay, his expression grave. "I've lived in these woods longer than most—seen what happens when a creature gets too curious." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red draws her cloak tighter, eyeing the mushrooms with new caution, her voice dropping to a whisper. "What happens to them—do they get very sick, or is it worse than that?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc fixes Red with a serious gaze, his hand resting protectively on the handle of his axe as he steps between her and the mushrooms. "Worse—I've found more than one fox or squirrel lying still beside a patch like this, never to wake again." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red, less experienced with the mushrooms than previously indicated, expresses surprise and curiosity, asking Luc how he knows so much.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red straightens up, brushing dust from her skirt, her eyes glinting with a mix of caution and certainty as she glances towards the thicket. "Oh, don't worry. I've seen tracks like these before—it's a Silverback Direwolf, not one of the usual mutts. They wander further than most folks realize." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc crosses his arms, brow raised in genuine curiosity, eyeing Red with newfound respect. "A Silverback, huh? Most folks wouldn't know the difference—how'd you come by that sort of knowledge?" ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red dusts off her hands and glances back at the fading paw prints, her tone matter-of-fact but edged with experience. "Let's just say I've had more than my share of close encounters—enough to learn their habits the hard way." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc leans in, crossing his arms and giving Red a searching look, curiosity clearly piqued. "Well, that's more than most trappers around here can claim—so what else do you know about these Silverbacks that I ought to?" ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red stoops to examine a snapped twig, her gaze sweeping the shadowy treeline with practiced caution. "They favor moonlit nights and never hunt alone—if you spot one, its pack is never far behind." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc explains his experience in the woods and shares cautionary tales.

Their conversation shifts to animal tracks, with Red showing unexpected knowledge about the Silverback Direwolf, revealing she’s had personal encounters and understands their pack behavior.

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc gestures with his walking stick down a narrow, mossy trail, his eyes cool and steady as he waits for Red’s reply, the dappled light flickering over his face. "These woods can be tricky if you don’t know the paths, mademoiselle. But I’ve spent many years beneath these trees—I know a shortcut, one the hunters never use. If you’d like, I can show you. It’ll bring you to your grandmother’s door before the sun climbs too high." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, her basket held close, eyes flickering between Luc and the shadowy trail he gestures toward. "That sounds helpful, monsieur, but Mama always warned me to stay on the main path—why do the hunters avoid your shortcut?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc offers a reassuring smile, gesturing invitingly toward a narrow, leafy trail barely visible between the trees. "Ah, the hunters prefer open trails where their prey has nowhere to hide—my path winds close to the stream, quieter, shaded, and less travelled by those with heavy boots." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, her grip tightening slightly on her basket as she glances toward the shaded path Luc gestures to. "I suppose the stream does sound lovely, but Mama says quiet places can hold secrets—do you truly think it’s safe?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc offers a reassuring smile, extending his hand with an inviting gesture toward the shaded, winding trail. "You have my word, mademoiselle—the only secrets this path keeps are those of birds and wildflowers, and I would not let harm come to you." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tugs her red cloak tighter, peering up at Luc with cautious curiosity as she steps just a little closer to him. "If you promise to walk with me and point out the wildflowers, monsieur, I suppose I could see your shortcut for myself." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc, impressed, asks for more insight and then offers to guide her on a lesser-known shortcut, explaining its safety and the reasons hunters avoid it.

Red, cautious due to her mother’s warnings, asks probing questions about the shortcut’s safety.

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Luc, her red cloak brushing against low-hanging branches as she steps carefully over a fallen log, her basket swinging lightly in her hand. "Funny, isn't it? The deeper we go, the quieter the birds get. I always thought this part of the forest was supposed to be safe, but today it feels different. Do you come this way often, Luc?" ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc glances sidelong at Red, his hand resting near the axe at his belt as a low breeze stirs the leaves overhead. "Aye, more often than most, though the woods never offer quite the same welcome twice—best we keep our wits about us." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances over her shoulder, clutching her basket a little tighter as the shadows deepen between the trees. "I suppose that's why Grandmother always warned me to stay on the path—she said the forest remembers every footstep, but not always kindly." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc scans the undergrowth with a practiced eye, his axe resting comfortably at his side as he guides Red around a gnarled root protruding from the mossy earth. "Your grandmother's a wise woman—these trees have long memories and longer shadows; sometimes it's not just the wolves you need to watch for." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Luc, clutching her basket a little tighter as a breeze stirs the branches overhead. "Sometimes I wonder if the shadows themselves are listening, waiting for secrets to slip between the leaves." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc glances sideways at Red, lowering his voice, as a gust stirs the branches overhead and a distant crack echoes through the undergrowth. "If they are, best we give them nothing worth repeating—silence can be a shield, if you know how to wear it." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at Luc, brushing a stray curl behind her ear as she sidesteps a crooked root, her grip tightening on the basket swinging at her side. "Silence is harder than it sounds, especially when your heart won't stop thumping loud enough for every branch to hear." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc (The Woodsman)Luc glances sideways at Red, his axe resting lightly on his shoulder, the dappled light flickering across his weathered face as they tread deeper into the gloom. "The forest has a way of echoing what’s inside you—fear, hope, even secrets; but there’s comfort in knowing you’re not walking it alone." ——Luc (The Woodsman)

Red (Little Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on the basket, glancing sidelong at Luc, her steps unconsciously matching his as the shadows deepen around them. "Maybe that's why I agreed to let you walk with me—it's easier to be brave when someone else is listening too." ——Red (Little Red Riding Hood)

Luc reassures her, promising to protect her and share knowledge about the woods’ flora.

Red ultimately agrees, suggesting she trusts him as long as he walks with her and points out wildflowers.

As they proceed, their dialogue deepens, reflecting on the forest’s shifting mood and the wisdom of Red’s grandmother.

The atmosphere grows more introspective, with both characters discussing the nature of the forest, the meaning of silence, and the comfort of companionship.

Red admits her courage is bolstered by Luc’s presence, showing a growing trust and rapport between them as they walk into the narrowing, shadowed path.

----------------------------------------

Their steps slow as the trees close in, shadows layering the path in uncertainty. Just as Red finds herself emboldened by Luc’s company, a sudden rustling from the undergrowth interrupts their exchange. The forest, once merely a backdrop to their conversation, now seems to press in with a new urgency. A figure emerges between the trunks, axe glinting at his side—a presence that neither Red nor Luc can ignore, shifting the course of their journey in an instant.

# Chapter 6: The Woodsman Intervenes

Red steps onto the mossy path, her boots squelching in the soft ground, a basket clutched tight in her hand.

The Wolf, unusually tense, circles her, his amber eyes scanning the shadows—not for prey, but for signs of a deeper threat.

He warns of change on the wind, his instincts alerting him to more than just the familiar dance with Red.

Luc bursts from the thicket, axe in hand, but instead of immediately threatening the Wolf, he demands clarity and truth, placing himself as both protector and interrogator.

Red, refusing to be relegated to a passive role, asserts her agency, demanding that all voices be heard and truths revealed.

The conversation grows tense and probing, with each character exposing suspicion and deeper motivations: Red seeks answers, not rescue;

Luc admits to secrets buried in the forest;

the Wolf reveals his presence at Grandmother’s house was a warning, not an attack.

As accusations and questions fly, a new tension emerges: the realization that something else, a darker presence or secret, stalks them all.

The fragile peace becomes an uneasy alliance as the trio acknowledges a greater threat lurking in the woods, shifting their focus from mutual suspicion to confronting the unknown together.

WolfThe Wolf narrows his eyes, hackles bristling, and shifts his weight from paw to paw, muscles taut as bowstrings. "Something's out there. I can taste it on the wind. Not prey, not tonight. Trouble, maybe. Or worse—change. Hmph. Always the scent of change before the world turns upside down." ——Wolf

WolfThe Wolf lowers his head, ears swiveling as he pads quietly to the edge of the clearing, muscles coiled and eyes narrowed against the coming unknown. "Best keep my senses sharp—change has teeth sharper than mine." ——Wolf

----------------------------------------

Together, they stepped into the deepening shadows, united by uncertainty but no longer alone, as the forest held its breath for what would come next.
