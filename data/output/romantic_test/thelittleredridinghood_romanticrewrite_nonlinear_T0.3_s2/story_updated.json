Unlike before, Red now actively invites Luc to stay close, recognizing the risks of the journey and accepting his protective presence more willingly. Luc reassures her, expressing his sense of duty and deeper emotional investment in her safety. Red acknowledges her desire to prove herself capable but also admits to feeling the weight of others’ concerns. The two proceed together, Red remaining alert but leaning more on Luc’s support and experience, deepening their mutual trust and setting the stage for future challenges and evolving dynamics between independence and companionship.",

She cautions Red, pointing to the edge of the forest visible through the window, reminding her to stay on the marked path and not speak to strangers. Red listens attentively and reassures her mother with repeated promises not to stray from the path nor speak to anyone she does not know, showing her determination to follow instructions and her sense of responsibility. Red’s mother presses the basket into her daughter’s hands, squeezing her fingers with urgency, reminding her to return before nightfall. Red nods, hefts the basket, and steps out the creaking door, the scent of dew-soaked grass rising as she sets her boots on the narrow woodland trail, determined to complete her errand swiftly and prove her responsibility. This time, Red’s focus remains firmly on her task, her yearning for the village dance tempered by her promises to her mother.",

She glances at the bed, noting how the blankets are pulled high and Granny's cap is set oddly askew. The Wolf, hidden beneath the covers, adjusts the cap with a careful paw, mimicking Granny's voice as he greets her. Red sets the basket down on the table and moves closer, sniffing the air, her brows knitting at the unfamiliar scent. She leans in, ostensibly to check Granny's temperature, but her eyes linger on the shape of the hands and the glint of sharp teeth barely concealed by the quilt. The Wolf, sensing her scrutiny, pulls the blanket higher, feigning a shiver and asking for the soup Red has brought. Red ladles soup into a bowl, her hands steady, but she asks pointedly about Granny's 'changed voice' and 'big hands,' her tone light but her gaze unwavering. The Wolf, motivated to maintain his disguise and win Red's trust, responds with a raspy explanation about a cold and old age, forcing a cough and clutching the blanket tighter. As Red hands over the bowl, she brushes her fingers against the Wolf's paw, feeling the coarse fur beneath the glove, and subtly pulls back. The rain outside grows heavier, masking the tension in the room as Red, motivated by suspicion and a need for proof, edges toward the window, pretending to adjust the curtains while keeping the Wolf in sight. The scene ends with the Wolf sipping the soup, eyes following Red warily, both locked in a silent contest of vigilance.",

His nose twitched, catching the aroma of baking bread and herbal salves seeping from the cracks in the shutters. Driven by his desire to impress Red and test the humans' cleverness, he padded to the doorstep and tapped the door with a calculated gentleness. Inside, Granny paused her knitting, set her needles aside, and approached the door with measured steps, cane tapping on the worn planks. She cracked the door open, squinting through the gloom, her voice sly and steady: 'Not many visitors come by this early—what brings a wolf to my doorstep?' Wolf dipped his head, baring a practiced, nonthreatening grin, and replied, 'I've heard tales of your wisdom, old one. I come seeking advice for a friend lost in the woods.' Granny studied him, her sharp gaze lingering on his twitching ears, then stepped back, gesturing him in. As Wolf crossed the threshold, he brushed against a hanging sprig of lavender and scanned the cozy room for signs of Red's imminent arrival, his tail flicking with anticipation. Their exchange set the stage: Granny, wary yet intrigued, offered him a seat by the fire, while Wolf, ever watchful, positioned himself to observe both door and window, already plotting his next move.",

As she crouches to inspect them, Luc emerges from behind a mossy tree, axe slung over his shoulder, boots crunching on the soil. He clears his throat to announce his presence, then gestures toward the mushrooms, warning her with a low, steady voice about their poisonous nature. Red, less experienced with the mushrooms than previously indicated, expresses surprise and curiosity, asking Luc how he knows so much. Luc explains his experience in the woods and shares cautionary tales. Their conversation shifts to animal tracks, with Red showing unexpected knowledge about the Silverback Direwolf, revealing she’s had personal encounters and understands their pack behavior. Luc, impressed, asks for more insight and then offers to guide her on a lesser-known shortcut, explaining its safety and the reasons hunters avoid it. Red, cautious due to her mother’s warnings, asks probing questions about the shortcut’s safety. Luc reassures her, promising to protect her and share knowledge about the woods’ flora. Red ultimately agrees, suggesting she trusts him as long as he walks with her and points out wildflowers. As they proceed, their dialogue deepens, reflecting on the forest’s shifting mood and the wisdom of Red’s grandmother. The atmosphere grows more introspective, with both characters discussing the nature of the forest, the meaning of silence, and the comfort of companionship. Red admits her courage is bolstered by Luc’s presence, showing a growing trust and rapport between them as they walk into the narrowing, shadowed path.",

This preserves character logic and the natural progression of trust and rapport between Red and Luc."

The Wolf, unusually tense, circles her, his amber eyes scanning the shadows—not for prey, but for signs of a deeper threat. He warns of change on the wind, his instincts alerting him to more than just the familiar dance with Red. Luc bursts from the thicket, axe in hand, but instead of immediately threatening the Wolf, he demands clarity and truth, placing himself as both protector and interrogator. Red, refusing to be relegated to a passive role, asserts her agency, demanding that all voices be heard and truths revealed. The conversation grows tense and probing, with each character exposing suspicion and deeper motivations: Red seeks answers, not rescue; Luc admits to secrets buried in the forest; the Wolf reveals his presence at Grandmother’s house was a warning, not an attack. As accusations and questions fly, a new tension emerges: the realization that something else, a darker presence or secret, stalks them all. The fragile peace becomes an uneasy alliance as the trio acknowledges a greater threat lurking in the woods, shifting their focus from mutual suspicion to confronting the unknown together.",

The plot is updated to reflect this expanded focus on secrets, mutual questioning, and the emergence of a potential new antagonist in the woods."
