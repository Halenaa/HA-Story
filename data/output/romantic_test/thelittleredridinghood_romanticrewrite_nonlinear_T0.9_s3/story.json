The door creaks open, and inside, the Wolf—disguised in Grandmother's shawl and cap—sits propped in bed, shadowed by the flickering hearth. Red steps inside, scanning the dim room, her nose wrinkling at the unfamiliar scent of musk and damp fur beneath the overlay of herbal tea. The Wolf, voice pitched oddly high, beckons her closer, asking about her journey. Red edges nearer, setting her basket down, her eyes lingering on the Wolf's too-large hands folded atop the quilt. She comments on Grandmother's 'appearance,' her tone cautious but polite, while the Wolf adjusts the shawl to hide his claws, replying with a rehearsed warmth and urging Red to come sit and share her news. Each gesture and reply is measured, Red testing the boundaries of familiarity, the Wolf maneuvering to keep her engaged and unsuspecting.",

The Wolf, disguised as a lean, dark-haired poet with a silver-tipped cane, stepped from behind a thicket, brushing pine needles from his cloak. He greeted her with a bow, reciting a line of verse about wandering hearts. Red narrowed her gaze, shifting her stance and asking how he came to know these woods. The Wolf offered a sly smile, tapping his cane on a patch of mushrooms, and proposed a bargain: directions to a shortcut in exchange for one of Grandmother’s famous honey cakes. Red considered the trade, weighing his offer as she handed over a pastry from her basket, watching his gloved hand curl around it. The Wolf bit into the cake, crumbs dusting his lips, and pointed deeper into the woods, promising safety while his eyes lingered on Red’s gaze. The scene ended with Red choosing to step off the main path, her fingers tightening on the basket as she followed the stranger’s directions, the Wolf trailing her steps with silent anticipation.",

Sunlight filters through the small, leaded windows, dappling the rough wooden table where a loaf of bread and a crock of butter rest. The scent of baking bread lingers in the air, mingling with the crisp scent of dew-soaked earth wafting from the open doorway. Outside, robins chirp in the tangled hedgerow, and the distant rustle of leaves hints at the forest's awakening.",

Her mother, apron tied neatly, busies herself bundling a parcel with cheese and wild herbs, her hands moving with practiced precision. She glances out the window toward the woods, then turns to Red, voice low but firm: 'Your grandmother needs these supplies, and she is alone now. But the forest is not always kind—go swiftly, do not stray from the path, and trust your own good sense.' Red knots her red cloak securely around her shoulders, fingers lingering over the fabric, then reaches for the basket her mother offers. Their gazes meet—Red's determined, her mother's cautious. With a final nod, Red steps out into the cool morning, boots crunching on gravel, as her mother stands in the doorway, watching until Red disappears into the green shadow of the trees. The objective is set: Red is to deliver food and medicine to her grandmother, proving her reliability while her mother entrusts her with the family's safety. The result: Red embarks on her journey, the weight of her mother's trust and warnings guiding her first steps into the woods.",

The Wolf circles the clearing, ears pricked for sounds from within—the soft clink of a teacup, the scrape of a chair. Driven by both hunger and curiosity, he skirts the garden, then slinks up to the back window, rising on his hind legs to peer inside. He spots Grandmother folding linens at the hearth, her movements steady and practiced. Without hesitation, the Wolf skirts the wall, then scratches lightly at the door with calculated gentleness. When Grandmother calls out, 'Who is there?' the Wolf pitches his voice high, mimicking Red's tone: 'It's me, Grandmother—Red, with a basket for you.' He waits, poised and alert, tail flicking, ready to act the moment the latch lifts. His objective: gain entry and outwit the old woman before Red arrives.",

He intercepts her path, holding up a hand in greeting and calling her name. Lucian glances at the basket, asking pointedly if she's heading all the way to her grandmother's alone. He shifts his weight and offers to walk with her, voice low and careful. Red squares her shoulders, declines with a polite but firm shake of her head, and assures him she can manage. Lucian hesitates, then silently plants his axe into the soft earth at their feet to show he means no harm, insisting he only wants to keep her safe. Red picks up a fallen stick and taps it against a stone, then thanks Lucian but steps forward on her own, determined. Lucian watches her go, brow furrowed, before retrieving his axe and following at a cautious distance, scanning the woods for any movement. Through their brief exchange, the edge of frost in Red’s tone and Lucian’s careful persistence reveal their tentative trust—and the unspoken tension between her desire for independence and his urge to protect.",

Lucian's boots splash through a shallow puddle as he positions himself protectively between Red and the Wolf, who leans with deceptive ease against the fence, rainwater beading on his dark coat. Lucian narrows his eyes, muscles tense, and says, 'Step away from Red.' The Wolf flicks his tail, offers a sly grin, and replies, 'Why spoil our conversation, woodsman?' Red raises her voice, cutting through the tension: 'I can speak for myself.' She steps forward, mud caking her hem, and deliberately places herself between the two. Lucian glances at her, jaw clenched, but lowers his axe a fraction, driven by his need to protect her but forced to trust her judgment. The Wolf cocks his head, eyes glinting, and circles Red at a measured pace, claws barely making a sound on the sodden ground. Red keeps her posture tall and steady, asserting, 'No one decides for me.' The Wolf hesitates, momentarily thrown by her certainty, while Lucian shifts his stance to be ready, his knuckles whitening on the axe handle. The confrontation halts as Red demands the Wolf state his intentions, forcing both men to face her authority. The air between them is charged, damp leaves sticking to their boots, as the Wolf considers her challenge and Lucian waits, prepared to act if Red signals for his help.",

Red steps forward, blocking Lucian's path and facing The Wolf, her jaw set. She asks the Wolf, 'Why should I believe you now, after everything you've done?' The Wolf circles the room, nose twitching at the scent of blood and herbs, then stops, his gaze meeting Red's. Lucian places his axe on the table, showing his willingness to let Red choose, while The Wolf lowers his head, eyes never leaving hers. Red, motivated by her need to decide her own fate, glances at both men, then lifts her chin and declares, 'This is my choice to make.

Grandmother, determined to support Red's independence, speaks softly: 'You must choose for yourself, child.' Red, focused and resolute, listens to both men, then stands and walks to the window, feeling the cool glass and watching the moon. She turns, eyes clear, and says, 'My trust is earned, not given. Lucian, you have protected me. Wolf, you have challenged me. I choose my own path, and it starts with Grandmother safe.' Lucian agrees to stand guard for the night, and The Wolf, with a sly smile, promises to stay away from the cottage until Red calls for him.
