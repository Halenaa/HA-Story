        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue introduces an extended, cautious encounter between Red and the Wolf in the woods before Red reaches the cottage, which was not present in the original plot summary. In this new version, Red meets the Wolf as a stranger and allows him to walk with her for a short distance, engaging in a subtle, guarded conversation that sets up their dynamic before the cottage scene. This addition is consistent with the character motivations and enhances the natural progression of suspicion and cleverness in Red's behavior. The updated plot now integrates both the woodland meeting and the cottage confrontation, maintaining logical character connections.",

        "plot_updated": true,
        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue deepened Red's caution and skepticism, making her challenge the Wolf more directly and insist on transparency and earned trust, rather than simply accepting his directions after a brief bargain. The exchange became a more layered negotiation, with Red demanding the Wolf walk ahead and prove his trustworthiness in daylight, not just shadows. The plot has been updated to reflect this more complex dynamic, emphasizing Red's cleverness and independence, and the Wolf's willingness to play along, intrigued by Red's spirit.",

The updated plot reflects these changes, showing Red and Lucian walking together briefly, sharing more personal dialogue, and then Red continuing alone by her own choice.",

The Wolf references Lucian's secrets, and Lucian admits to having sins and hidden truths, which is not present in the original plot.

Their motivations remain consistent, but the updated plot reflects their joint tactical planning, deeper emotional connection, and a new plan to take an unexpected, riskier route through the woods. The update maintains character logic and narrative flow.",
