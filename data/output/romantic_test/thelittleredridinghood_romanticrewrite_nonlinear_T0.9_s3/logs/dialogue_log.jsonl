The Wolf, posing as a lost traveler, subtly probes Red about her grandmother's situation and her feelings about the woods, while Red remains cautious, revealing little about her grandmother and her family. Red allows the Wolf to walk partway with her, but both maintain a guarded distance, each testing the other's trust and intentions through clever, measured exchanges. When Red arrives at the cottage, she finds 'Grandmother' (the Wolf in disguise) waiting for her. The familiar dialogue between Red and the disguised Wolf unfolds, with Red noticing oddities in 'Grandmother's' appearance and behavior—her eyes, hands, ears, teeth, and voice—all while the Wolf attempts to reassure her and lure her closer. Red's suspicions grow, and she becomes increasingly wary, questioning the Wolf's identity and intentions even as he tries to convince her of his harmlessness.

The Wolf, intrigued and compliant, accepted her terms, guiding Red while continuing to charm and reassure her. Red remained wary, repeatedly testing his promises and making it clear she would follow only if convinced of her safety.
