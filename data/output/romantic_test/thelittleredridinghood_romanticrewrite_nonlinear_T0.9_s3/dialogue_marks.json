The door creaks open, and inside, the Wolf—disguised in Grandmother's shawl and cap—sits propped in bed, shadowed by the flickering hearth. Red steps inside, scanning the dim room, her nose wrinkling at the unfamiliar scent of musk and damp fur beneath the overlay of herbal tea. The Wolf, voice pitched oddly high, beckons her closer, asking about her journey. Red edges nearer, setting her basket down, her eyes lingering on the Wolf's too-large hands folded atop the quilt. She comments on Grandmother's 'appearance,' her tone cautious but polite, while the Wolf adjusts the shawl to hide his claws, replying with a rehearsed warmth and urging Red to come sit and share her news. Each gesture and reply is measured, Red testing the boundaries of familiarity, the Wolf maneuvering to keep her engaged and unsuspecting.",

He greeted her with a bow, reciting a line of verse about wandering hearts. Red narrowed her gaze, shifting her stance and asking how he came to know these woods. The Wolf offered a sly smile, tapping his cane on a patch of mushrooms, and proposed a bargain: directions to a shortcut in exchange for one of Grandmother’s famous honey cakes. Red considered the trade, weighing his offer as she handed over a pastry from her basket, watching his gloved hand curl around it. The Wolf bit into the cake, crumbs dusting his lips, and pointed deeper into the woods, promising safety while his eyes lingered on Red’s gaze. The scene ended with Red choosing to step off the main path, her fingers tightening on the basket as she followed the stranger’s directions, the Wolf trailing her steps with silent anticipation.",

Lucian narrows his eyes, muscles tense, and says, 'Step away from Red.' The Wolf flicks his tail, offers a sly grin, and replies, 'Why spoil our conversation, woodsman?' Red raises her voice, cutting through the tension: 'I can speak for myself.' She steps forward, mud caking her hem, and deliberately places herself between the two. Lucian glances at her, jaw clenched, but lowers his axe a fraction, driven by his need to protect her but forced to trust her judgment. The Wolf cocks his head, eyes glinting, and circles Red at a measured pace, claws barely making a sound on the sodden ground. Red keeps her posture tall and steady, asserting, 'No one decides for me.' The Wolf hesitates, momentarily thrown by her certainty, while Lucian shifts his stance to be ready, his knuckles whitening on the axe handle. The confrontation halts as Red demands the Wolf state his intentions, forcing both men to face her authority. The air between them is charged, damp leaves sticking to their boots, as the Wolf considers her challenge and Lucian waits, prepared to act if Red signals for his help.",

Lucian sets down his axe, wipes sweat from his brow, and hands Red a small carved wooden talisman shaped like a wolf. He says, 'Keep this with you—reminders help us see danger before it comes close.' Red turns the talisman over in her palm, the wood cool and rough, and meets Lucian's eyes. She thanks him, then steps forward to help load the last logs, their hands briefly brushing. Lucian, motivated by his desire to protect Red and prove his trustworthiness, asks, 'Will you let me walk with you to Grandmother’s today?' Red considers, then shakes her head. 'I need to do this on my own.' She shoulders her basket, glancing up at the sun-lit woods as she sets off down the path, her stride steady and resolute. Lucian watches her go, tightening his grip on the axe, ready to guard her from afar.",
