# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Senses Deception

Red enters the woods on her way to her grandmother's cottage, taking the familiar flowery trail as usual.

On her journey, she encounters a stranger—the Wolf, who introduces himself and engages Red in conversation.

The Wolf, posing as a lost traveler, subtly probes Red about her grandmother's situation and her feelings about the woods, while Red remains cautious, revealing little about her grandmother and her family.

Red allows the Wolf to walk partway with her, but both maintain a guarded distance, each testing the other's trust and intentions through clever, measured exchanges.

When Red arrives at the cottage, she finds 'Grandmother' (the Wolf in disguise) waiting for her.

The Wolf tilts his head with an exaggerated smile, his high-pitched voice echoing strangely among the trees. He gestures with a paw, inviting Red to step closer, his eyes glinting with curiosity and something unspoken. "Well, hello there, little one! What brings you so deep into these woods on such a fine day?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing nervously at the Wolf's strange smile. "Oh, I'm just on my way to visit my grandmother—she lives just beyond the bend." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in, his ears perked and eyes glinting with curiosity, voice lilting unnaturally high as he smiles just a bit too widely. "How delightful! Is your dear grandmother expecting you, or will your visit be a surprise?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket nervously, glancing at the Wolf's unnaturally cheerful grin. "She knows I'm coming—I bring her fresh bread from mother every week." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in closer, his bright eyes glinting as he tilts his head, voice lilting sweetly but just a bit too shrill. "Such a thoughtful granddaughter you are—tell me, is your grandmother quite alone out there?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket nervously, glancing at the Wolf with uncertainty. "Yes, it's just her and her little cat—she says the woods are peaceful, but I worry sometimes." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf steps a little closer, his smile widening as his high voice echoes oddly among the trees. "Oh, how brave you must be, venturing all by yourself!" ——The Wolf

The Wolf leans in closer, his bright eyes unblinking, voice lilting as he gestures subtly toward the two diverging trails. "Tell me, little one, which path do you take to reach her cottage—the flowery trail or the path that winds through the shadows?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket on her arm, glancing nervously at the Wolf, uncertain but trying to sound cheerful. "I usually take the flowery trail—it's brighter and I love picking daisies along the way." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in closer, his bright eyes glinting with a peculiar intensity as he gestures subtly toward the darker path. "The Wolf (voice lilting, almost musical): Ah, the flowery trail—such a lovely choice! But do you ever wonder what secrets the shadowed path might hold?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket nervously and glances at the Wolf, her fingers fidgeting with the edge of her cloak. "Oh, I suppose sometimes I do wonder, but Mama says to always choose the sunny way, just to be safe." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in just a bit too close, eyes glinting with a curious intensity as he grins, his sharp teeth barely visible beneath a friendly smile. "The Wolf (voice airy, with an odd, playful trill): Wise advice from Mama, but sometimes, little one, the most interesting things are found where the light barely touches—don’t you think?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hugs her basket a bit closer, glancing nervously at the Wolf. "Maybe, but I think I'd rather stick to the flowers—Mama would be worried if I wandered too far." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The familiar dialogue between Red and the disguised Wolf unfolds, with Red noticing oddities in 'Grandmother's' appearance and behavior—her eyes, hands, ears, teeth, and voice—all while the Wolf attempts to reassure her and lure her closer.

Red's suspicions grow, and she becomes increasingly wary, questioning the Wolf's identity and intentions even as he tries to convince her of his harmlessness.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates by the bedside, hands twisting at her basket strap, brow furrowed as she studies Grandmother's face, her gaze lingering on the unblinking, gleaming eyes. "Grandmother, what. big eyes you have today. Are you feeling quite yourself? The light seems to catch them differently." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pats the pillow beside him, his smile gentle as he tucks his hands deeper beneath the shawl. "Ah, my dear, age tends to sharpen one's senses—come closer so I can see your lovely face and hear all about your journey." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the edge of the bed, clutching her basket, eyes flickering between the bonnet and the Wolf's face. "And your ears, Grandmother—they look so much larger than I remember; is it the new bonnet?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pats the quilted bed invitingly, keeping his hands hidden beneath the shawl while offering Red a gentle, expectant smile. "Oh, child, this bonnet was meant to keep out the chill, but I suppose it does make my ears stand out—come, sit beside me and tell me all that's happened since last you visited." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, eyes flickering to where the Wolf's paws clutch the shawl, her voice gentle but edged with uncertainty. "Your hands seem rather rough, Grandmother—have you been working in the garden more than usual?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tucks his claws more securely beneath the shawl, offering a gentle, beckoning smile to mask his unease. "Ah, these old hands have seen many seasons, my dear—just the weather making them a bit more worn, that's all; now, don't be shy, come closer and let me hold them in mine." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, fingers twisting the edge of her basket, her eyes narrowing as she studies the figure beneath the shawl. "Grandmother, your voice sounds different too—it's deeper, somehow; are you quite sure you're feeling well?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pats the spot on the bed beside him, curling the shawl tighter around his shoulders to further obscure his features, his eyes watching Red intently for any sign of suspicion. "Why, my sweet, a touch of the cold has made my throat a little hoarse, but nothing a warm cup of tea and your company won't cure—please, sit right here by my side." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, clutching her basket tighter and scanning Grandmother's face for reassurance. "If you're certain, Grandmother, though everything about you feels a little unfamiliar today—are you sure it's just the weather?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pats the bed invitingly, drawing the shawl tighter around his shoulders, his eyes fixed on Red with an eager, almost hungry, smile. "Oh, my dear, sometimes the years change us in ways we don't expect, but my love for you remains just the same—come, let me tuck you in close where it's warm." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the bedside, her eyes lingering on the Wolf's mouth, fingers tightening nervously around her basket. "Grandmother, your teeth—they look so very sharp; have you changed your diet lately, or is it just a trick of the firelight?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf offers a gentle, toothy smile, carefully pulling the shawl higher as he pats the bed invitingly, his eyes fixed on Red with practiced affection. "My dear, it's only the shadows playing tricks—now, why don't you tell me all about your walk through the woods?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates beside the bed, clutching her basket tighter, her gaze lingering on the Wolf's unsettling grin. "Well, I suppose the woods seemed quieter than usual, but sitting here with you feels. different, like something is lurking just beneath the surface." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf offers a gentle, reassuring smile and pats the bed invitingly, careful to keep his claws hidden beneath the shawl. "Oh, child, perhaps it's simply your imagination running wild after a lonely walk—there is nothing to fear here with me." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the foot of the bed, her basket clutched tightly, eyes darting from the Wolf's mouth to his shadowed form under the covers. "Still, Grandmother, I can't help but notice how your smile looks so. wide tonight; are you sure everything is as it should be?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf gently pats the seat beside him, his eyes glinting as he adjusts the shawl to further conceal his claws, leaning forward with a reassuring, inviting warmth. "My dear, sometimes a smile grows with happiness at seeing you—come closer, let me wrap this shawl around you and chase away those worries." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates before sitting, her eyes darting between the Wolf's face and hands, her body tense with suspicion. "Grandmother, your embrace feels strangely strong—almost as if you were someone else entirely." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pulls Red in just a bit tighter, his eyes glittering as he offers a gentle pat on her shoulder, keeping his claws hidden beneath the shawl. "Nonsense, my precious—who else could I possibly be but your loving grandmother, eager to keep you safe and warm?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates, pulling back slightly and searching the Wolf's face for a familiar kindness. "If you truly are my grandmother, then why do I feel a chill even in your arms?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tightens the shawl around Red, drawing her nearer, his gaze fixed intently on her, masking his hunger with a gentle, practiced smile. "Oh, little one, perhaps it's just the draft sneaking through the shutters—come, nestle closer, and you'll see there's nothing to fear in these familiar arms." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates at the edge of the bed, her fingers gripping her basket tightly as she studies the Wolf's face in the flickering firelight. "Grandmother, if you are truly yourself, then why do your eyes gleam so hungrily when you look at me?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The chapter alternates between Red's encounter with the Wolf in the woods and her subsequent suspicious conversation with 'Grandmother' in the cottage, emphasizing Red's cleverness and independence as she navigates both situations with caution and resourcefulness.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red pauses at the edge of the shadows, fingers tightening around her basket, eyes scanning the Wolf’s face with polite curiosity, masking the hint of wariness in her tone. "Good afternoon, sir. It's a strange thing, meeting anyone on this path—especially someone I don’t recognize. Are you… looking for someone?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tilts his head, voice warm and disarming, while his eyes linger a moment too long on the basket Red carries. "Ah, good afternoon, young miss—I'm merely enjoying the shade of these woods, though it seems I've lost my way; do you often walk alone here?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket to the other arm, glancing sidelong at the Wolf, careful to keep a polite distance. "Not often, and never without a reason—though my errands tend to be brief, and I keep to the sunlit trails when I can." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf offers a gentle, reassuring smile, his eyes intent but his posture relaxed, as if inviting trust. "Sensible of you—these woods can be tricky for strangers, but with a guide, perhaps even their shadows hold no real threat." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket slightly, maintaining a careful distance while her eyes watch the Wolf’s movements. "A guide, perhaps—but only if one knows whom to trust in the shade as well as the light." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tilts his head, voice gentle, eyes narrowing just enough to study Red's guarded posture. "Trust is earned, not given, especially where shadows linger—tell me, what brings you beneath these trees today, if not the sunlit path?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket to the other arm, eyes lingering on the Wolf's paws before meeting his gaze with polite caution. "My grandmother lives just beyond the bend—she's unwell, and I bring her what comfort I can, though I take care not to linger where the trees grow thick." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf inclines his head respectfully, keeping his stance relaxed, but his eyes linger a moment too long on Red’s basket. "A granddaughter’s devotion is a rare and precious thing—may I walk a little way with you, just until the path forks, for company’s sake?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket to her other arm, taking a measured step forward while glancing sidelong at the Wolf. "Company’s sake, or curiosity’s?—I suppose a short walk won’t do harm, so long as we keep to the open path." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf falls into step beside Red, keeping a respectful distance, his eyes watchful but his tone light and inviting. "Then let us walk where the sunlight touches the leaves, and perhaps you’ll be kind enough to tell me more of your grandmother—she must be quite remarkable to inspire such care." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at the Wolf, her pace steady but her grip tightening slightly on her basket. "She is, but she values her privacy above all—so I try not to share too much with those she hasn’t met." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tilts his head, adopting a gentle, deferential posture, but his eyes quietly study Red’s face for any sign of further suspicion. "Of course—one should never betray a trust lightly; I would not dream of prying, only hoping to pass a little time in pleasant company while the path allows." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at the Wolf, her grip tightening on her basket as she carefully watches his expression. "Pleasant company is best enjoyed with a watchful eye, I think—especially when the woods are so full of secrets." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf glances sideways, careful to match Red's pace, his tone gentle but his gaze flickering to gauge her wariness. "Ah, but secrets are merely stories waiting for the right listener—perhaps you’ll find I’m content with only the tale of your walk, nothing more." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances sideways at the Wolf, her grip tightening on her basket as she subtly positions herself closer to the sunlit edge of the path. "Stories are easily twisted in the telling, especially by those who prefer listening to speaking—so I watch my words as carefully as my steps." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf matches Red’s pace, maintaining a respectful distance, his eyes occasionally flicking to her basket as if admiring the cloth rather than its weight. "Wise indeed; the wrong word in the wrong ear can echo far beyond these trees, though you needn’t fear—my interest is only in sharing the quiet between footsteps, nothing more." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances sidelong at the Wolf, her grip tightening on her basket as she steps into a patch of sunlight, putting a measured distance between them. "Then let’s walk quietly, and let the woods speak for us—sometimes silence tells more than a stranger’s questions." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

# Chapter 3: The Wolf's Deceptive Bargain

Red, gripping the basket, paused beside a fallen log and adjusted her scarf, her eyes alert to the forest's shadows.

The Wolf, disguised as a lean, dark-haired poet with a silver-tipped cane, emerged from the thicket, bowing and speaking in veiled, poetic riddles about the secrets of the woods and wandering hearts.

Their conversation unfolded as a cautious duel of wits, with Red questioning the Wolf's familiarity with the forest and probing his motives.

The Wolf sweeps into a deep, graceful bow, his gaze lingering on Red with a glimmer equal parts mischief and warmth, his smile unreadable but inviting. "Ah, but what brings a wandering heart to these tangled woods? Are you searching for something, or merely following where the wildflowers nod?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head slightly, studying the Wolf with a mix of curiosity and guarded politeness. "Perhaps I follow the path for both reasons—though I wonder if the wildflowers hide more than they reveal." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The WolfHe steps lightly closer, voice low and eyes intent, as if inviting her to share in a private confidence. "Sometimes, the wildest blooms guard the sweetest secrets, if one knows how to listen to their whispers." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, her gaze steady on the Wolf, a cautious smile playing at her lips. "Then perhaps you can teach me how to listen, for I suspect not all secrets wish to be found." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf steps lightly beside Red, his gaze intent yet inviting, as if daring her to accept the challenge. "Ah, but secrets have a way of finding those who walk with open eyes and careful feet—shall we see what the forest wishes to share tonight?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red casts a cautious glance deeper into the trees, her hand tightening around her basket as she steps just within arm's reach of the Wolf. "Lead on, then, but I hope your words are as gentle as your manners—some whispers in these woods can turn to warnings, after all." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf responded with enigmatic hints about his comfort in darkness and his own history as both hunter and hunted.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, her grip tightening on her basket as she shifts her weight, placing herself between the Wolf and the path ahead. "You seem to know every twist and turn of this forest, more than any traveler I've met. How is it you’re so familiar with these woods?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf offers a toothy grin, his eyes flicking to the shadows beyond Red, as if recalling secret paths unseen by most. "Ah, little one, when you spend as many nights beneath these branches as I have, the forest itself becomes your map." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her eyes scanning the shadows behind the Wolf as if searching for unseen threats. "And what is it that keeps you wandering here after dark, when most creatures seek the safety of their dens?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf's eyes gleam faintly in the dim light, his posture relaxed but alert, studying Red's wary expression. "Some of us find comfort in shadows, Red, where secrets are thick and the curious seldom tread." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her eyes never leaving the Wolf's, a cautious step increasing the distance between them. "Comfort, or something to hunt—tell me, Wolf, what do you truly seek among these secrets?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf's eyes glint with a sly, knowing light as he circles Red, keeping a measured distance yet never breaking her gaze. "Curiosity, perhaps; but isn't it true, Red, that those who walk alone in the woods often carry secrets of their own?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes never leaving the Wolf as she subtly shifts her weight, ready to move if needed. "Maybe, but it's those who lurk in the shadows asking questions who worry me most, Wolf." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf tilts his head, his eyes glinting with a sly, knowing light as he circles a step closer, never breaking Red’s gaze. "Ah, but it is only the wary who survive these woods, Red—perhaps I ask because I’ve learned to recognize another soul who doesn’t quite trust the dark." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, eyes narrowing further, her grip tightening on the basket as she steps just out of reach. "Trust is earned, not given—so if you know these woods so well, then tell me: what would you warn a stranger to beware of, Wolf?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes glinting with a mix of warning and invitation, as he steps just slightly closer to Red, the leaves crunching beneath his paws. "Beware the paths that twist away from the sun, for in their shadows, not every creature is content to let you pass unharmed." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red's hand tightens around her basket as she studies the Wolf, her eyes searching his face for any hint of truth or deception. "Wise words—but you speak as if you've seen what waits in those shadows firsthand; is that where you make your den, Wolf, or are you one of those creatures yourself?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf lowers his head, letting his yellow eyes catch the fading light, a faint smile hinting at something hidden as he studies Red's reaction. "Perhaps I am both the watcher and the watched, Red—one who knows what to fear because I have been feared myself." ——The Wolf

Instead of a simple, transactional exchange, their dialogue became an extended negotiation—Red challenged the Wolf to prove his trustworthiness by walking ahead and showing her the shortcut in daylight, insisting that trust must be earned and openly displayed.

The Wolf leans forward, cane tapping rhythmically atop a cluster of mushrooms, eyes glinting with amusement as he studies Red’s reaction. "Ah, but you see, little Red, the woods are full of winding ways and shadowed trails—most would lose themselves before the sun sets. Yet, I hold the secret to a path so swift, you’d reach Grandmother’s doorstep before the wolves begin their hunt. All I ask is a taste of that honey cake, so renowned even the birds sing of its sweetness. Fair trade, wouldn’t you say?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches the basket closer, eyeing the Wolf's grin with a mixture of curiosity and caution. "Well, it does seem a fair enough trade, sir, but you must promise the shortcut is safe and true—Grandmother trusts me with her cakes, and I’d hate to disappoint her." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in with a glint in his eye, brushing aside a fern to reveal a faint, hidden path. "But of course, my dear, my word is as golden as the honey in that cake—one morsel, and I’ll guide you where even the thorns dare not follow." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket a little tighter, her gaze lingering on the patch of mushrooms where the Wolf’s cane rests. "Very well, Mr. Wolf, but you must walk ahead and show me each step—if your word is golden, then let it shine in daylight, not in shadows." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The WolfHe gestures grandly to a narrow, overgrown path, beckoning her forward while glancing slyly over his shoulder. "The Wolf’s eyes gleamed as he bowed low, cane sweeping aside the mushrooms, 'Then let us walk together, Red, and may your trust be as sweet as your Grandmother’s recipe.'" ——The Wolf

The Wolf, intrigued and compliant, accepted her terms, guiding Red while continuing to charm and reassure her.

Red remained wary, repeatedly testing his promises and making it clear she would follow only if convinced of her safety.

The Wolf licks a stray crumb from his paw, his gaze fixed warmly on Red, even as the shadows behind him seem to deepen. "Trust me, little one. The darkest paths are often the safest—so long as you walk beside someone who knows the way. Stay close, and no harm shall find you." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket tighter, her eyes flicking from the Wolf's teeth to the shadowed path ahead. "If you're certain, I suppose I'll follow—but how do I know your way truly leads to safety, and not deeper danger?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf flashes a reassuring smile, gesturing invitingly down the winding, dim-lit path as his eyes glint with hidden intent. "Ah, but danger knows my scent and flees before me, dear Red; with each step I take, the shadows shrink away." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates, clutching her basket a bit tighter, her eyes narrowing as she studies the Wolf's face. "Maybe so—but sometimes, it’s what walks beside us that we ought to fear most." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The scene ended with Red stepping off the main path, tightly gripping her basket and following the Wolf's lead, but her skepticism remained evident, and the Wolf's anticipation was tinged with fascination at Red's independence and cleverness.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mission from Mother

Red stands at the table, slicing a heel of bread with a worn knife, crumbs scattering across the wood.

Her mother, apron tied neatly, busies herself bundling a parcel with cheese and wild herbs, her hands moving with practiced precision.

She glances out the window toward the woods, then turns to Red, voice low but firm: 'Your grandmother needs these supplies, and she is alone now.

Red's MotherShe gathers up the basket, placing it gently in Red's hands, her eyes lingering on the edge of the woods visible through the window, worry etching her brow. "Red, listen to me. Your grandmother needs these supplies, and she is alone now—she has no one else to help her. You must take these to her before nightfall." ——Red's Mother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches the basket tightly, her gaze flickering between her mother’s worried face and the looming trees outside. "I understand, Mother—I’ll go right away, but should I be careful of anything in the woods?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red's MotherShe places the basket in Red's hands, her eyes filled with worry as she brushes a strand of hair from Red's face. "Stay on the path, Red, and don't talk to strangers—promise me you'll be careful." ——Red's Mother

But the forest is not always kind—go swiftly, do not stray from the path, and trust your own good sense.

Red's Mother takes Red's hands in hers, her eyes filled with concern and love, making sure Red listens closely to her warning. "Red, before you go, remember what I've always told you: the forest is not always kind. You must go swiftly, never stray from the path, and above all, trust your own good sense. Promise me you'll remember, my dear." ——Red's Mother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red grips her basket tightly, glancing toward the shadowy trees with a mix of determination and unease. "I promise, Mother—I’ll keep to the path and watch carefully, no matter what I hear or see." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

' Red knots her red cloak securely around her shoulders, fingers lingering over the fabric, then reaches for the basket her mother offers.

Their gazes meet—Red's determined, her mother's cautious.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red squares her shoulders, voice steady but her hands clenched tight around the basket. Her eyes flick to the door, then back to her mother's worried face. "I know what you're going to say, but I have to do this, Mother. Grandma needs me, and I won't let fear stop me." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red's MotherShe reaches out, gently grasping Red's hand, her eyes searching for reassurance. "Red, being brave doesn't mean ignoring the dangers—promise me you'll keep to the path and watch for the shadows." ——Red's Mother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red lifts her cloak, her jaw set with quiet determination, even as her mother reaches out as if to hold her back. "I promise I'll be careful—but I can't turn back just because the woods are dark." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red's MotherHer mother's fingers tighten around the edge of Red's cloak, reluctant to let go. "Just remember, Red, there's more in those woods than darkness—and not all of it shows itself at first glance." ——Red's Mother

With a final nod, Red steps out into the cool morning, boots crunching on gravel, as her mother stands in the doorway, watching until Red disappears into the green shadow of the trees.

The objective is set: Red is to deliver food and medicine to her grandmother, proving her reliability while her mother entrusts her with the family's safety.

The result: Red embarks on her journey, the weight of her mother's trust and warnings guiding her first steps into the woods.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Wolf Reaches Grandmother's House

The Wolf pads silently from shadow to shadow, his paws barely stirring the needles on the ground.

He lifts his muzzle, sniffing the faint aroma of woodsmoke and baking bread drifting from Grandmother's cottage ahead.

The Wolf circles the clearing, ears pricked for sounds from within—the soft clink of a teacup, the scrape of a chair.

Driven by both hunger and curiosity, he skirts the garden, then slinks up to the back window, rising on his hind legs to peer inside.

He spots Grandmother folding linens at the hearth, her movements steady and practiced.

Without hesitation, the Wolf skirts the wall, then scratches lightly at the door with calculated gentleness.

When Grandmother calls out, 'Who is there?

Grandmother clutches her shawl tighter, her voice trembling as she peers toward the dimly lit doorway. "Who is there? Is that you, child? Or. someone else?" ——Grandmother

' the Wolf pitches his voice high, mimicking Red's tone: 'It's me, Grandmother—Red, with a basket for you.

The Wolf pitches his voice high, carefully mimicking Red's cheerful tone as he stands outside Grandmother's door, one paw resting lightly on the latch, straining to sound innocent and familiar. "It's me, Grandmother—Red, with a basket for you!" ——The Wolf

' He waits, poised and alert, tail flicking, ready to act the moment the latch lifts.

His objective: gain entry and outwit the old woman before Red arrives.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Handsome Stranger

Red steps briskly down the narrow path, her basket swinging at her side, brushing aside a low-hanging branch with a practiced swipe.

She pauses to adjust the red cloak at her shoulders, scanning the undergrowth for mushrooms.

Lucian emerges from behind a birch tree, axe slung over one shoulder, boots muddy from the morning's work.

He intercepts her path, calling her name and expressing concern about her being in the woods at this late hour.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian steps out from behind a mossy oak, his axe slung casually over his shoulder. He raises a hand in greeting, his eyes scanning the path behind Red before settling on her with a cautious, half-smile. "Red? Is that you? It's been a while since anyone's braved these woods at this hour." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, her eyes flickering with surprise and a hint of caution as she slows her steps, studying Lucian's face in the dappled light. "Lucian? I wasn't expecting to see anyone out here—especially not you." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian lowers his hand, a hint of concern in his eyes as he steps closer, scanning the shadowy trees behind her. "I could say the same—what brings you out so late, Red?" ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts the basket on her arm and glances down the shadowed path, her expression a mix of concern and determination. "Just running an errand for my grandmother—she wasn't feeling well, so I thought I'd bring her some supper." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian steps closer, his expression shifting from curiosity to genuine concern as he gestures down the path toward Red's destination. "You know these woods can turn treacherous after sundown—let me walk with you, just to be safe." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket to her other arm and offers a cautious but genuine smile. "I appreciate your concern, Lucian, but I can handle myself—though I wouldn't mind the company." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian falls into step beside Red, his axe slung casually over his shoulder, eyes scanning the shadowed trees. "All right, just as long as you don't mind some conversation to pass the time." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red explains she is bringing supper to her ailing grandmother.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian leans on his axe, brow furrowed with concern as he studies Red and the basket in her hands. "That’s quite a journey for someone your size, Red. These woods aren’t as friendly as they look. Are you sure it’s wise to travel alone?" ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red lifts her chin with a small, confident smile, clutching her basket a little tighter as she glances down the shadowed trail. "I’ve walked this path so many times, Lucian—I know every twist and tree by heart." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian folds his arms, his gaze scanning the shadows between the trees as if expecting something to emerge. "Even a well-trodden path can hide new dangers, especially with all the talk of wolves lately." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red lifts the basket a little higher with a determined smile, glancing toward the sun-dappled trail ahead. "Wolves talk in stories, not in daylight—besides, Gran’s expecting me and I promised her fresh bread." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian shifts his axe to one shoulder, gaze steady but gentle, silently offering protection. "Still, promises mean little if danger finds you first; let me walk with you, just until the bend." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Lucian warns her of the dangers and offers to accompany her for safety.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian shifts his weight from one foot to the other, his gaze flickering to Red before settling on the path ahead. He keeps his voice low and gentle, careful not to startle her, yet there's a subtle tension in his posture—a readiness, as if bracing for her reaction. "If you'd like, I can walk with you a ways. The woods aren't always kind to those traveling alone." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red meets his gaze steadily, her basket shifting slightly in her grip as she waits for his answer. "Thank you, Lucian—I'd appreciate the company, though I can't help but wonder if it's me or the woods you don't trust." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian glances at Red, his gaze searching, then steps aside to let her choose the path. "A bit of both, if I'm honest—the woods have their secrets, and folk aren’t always what they seem." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red adjusts the basket on her arm, meeting Lucian's gaze with a wary but earnest smile. "Then perhaps it's best we watch each other's backs, since neither of us seems entirely certain what we're walking into." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Unlike before, Red, after initially asserting her independence, accepts Lucian’s company for part of the way, with the understanding that she values her autonomy but recognizes the dangers.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red squares her shoulders, looks Lucian in the eye, and offers a warm but resolute smile, making it clear she appreciates his concern while asserting her independence. "Thank you for offering, Lucian, but I promise I can handle this on my own. It's not far, and I've made this journey many times before." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian nods, stepping back with a respectful smile, his watchful gaze lingering just a moment before he lets her continue on her path. "I understand, Red—just know if you ever need a hand, I’m not far behind." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

As they walk together, their conversation turns more personal—Lucian reveals he lost someone to the woods before, explaining his deep concern for Red.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian releases his grip on the axe and steps back, hands open and visible, his gaze earnest but conflicted as he tries to meet Red's wary eyes. "You don't have to worry, Red. I swear, I mean you no harm. My axe stays here, at your feet. I just—I've seen what lurks in these woods, and I couldn't live with myself if something happened to you. Please, let me watch over you—just until you're safe." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, glancing from Lucian to the axe and back, her grip tightening on her basket as she takes a cautious step back. "If you really mean that, then tell me—what exactly are you so afraid I'll run into out here?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian's gaze flickers to the dark thicket beyond, his knuckles whitening as memory flashes across his face. "It's not just wolves, Red—there are shadows in these trees that hunger for more than blood." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, taking a cautious step back, studying Lucian as if weighing every word for hidden threats. "Shadows that know your name, Red—creatures drawn by something about you, something I don't understand and can't fight alone." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian keeps his hands open and lowered, his eyes flickering with guilt and worry as he watches Red's face for any sign of trust. "Is it so hard to believe I want nothing from you but to keep you from becoming another story whispered around these woods?" ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her cloak, eyes narrowed, watching Lucian for any sign of deceit. "Stories don't save lives, Lucian—so if you want me to trust you, tell me why you care what happens to me at all." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian's gaze drops, his hands trembling slightly as he steps back from the axe, vulnerability flickering across his face. "Because once, I lost someone to these woods when I thought I could keep my distance—and I won't make the same mistake again." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red narrows her eyes, taking a cautious half-step back, her grip tightening on her cloak as she studies Lucian's face. "You think I'm like her, don't you—the one you lost?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian lowers his gaze, his hands open and empty, the axe still rooted in the earth between them. "No—you're not her, Red, but the fear I felt then is the same fear I feel now, and I can't just walk away and let the woods decide your fate." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red folds her arms tightly across her chest, her eyes searching Lucian's face for any sign of a lie. "So what—you're haunted by guilt, and I just happen to be the next girl who needs saving?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian looks away, fists clenching at his sides, the memory of loss flickering in his eyes before he meets Red's gaze with quiet resolve. "No, it's not about fixing the past—it's about not turning my back when I know what's out there and I know I can help." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red, empathetic but still determined to forge her own path, thanks Lucian for his honesty and help, but ultimately insists on completing the journey alone beyond a certain point.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red grips the stick tightly and steps past Lucian, her chin lifted with new resolve. "Thank you, Lucian, truly. I needed your help back there. But from here, I need to do this myself. I have to see it through—on my own terms." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian nods solemnly, stepping back into the shadow of the trees, his watchful gaze lingering on Red as she moves forward. "I understand, Red—just remember, the woods are never truly silent, so listen well as you go." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Lucian, respecting her decision but anxious, promises to stay close and keep watch from a distance.

Their exchange reveals not only the tension between Red’s independence and Lucian’s protectiveness, but also a growing trust and understanding between them, shaped by shared vulnerabilities and honest dialogue.

# Chapter 6: Lucian Confronts the Wolf

Red stands at the threshold of Grandmother's cottage, hand on the worn wooden latch, when Lucian bursts from the tree line, axe gripped tightly.

Lucian positions himself protectively between Red and the Wolf, but Red immediately steps forward, placing herself physically and emotionally between them.

Rather than simply demanding the Wolf state his intentions, Red asserts herself as a shield for Lucian, declaring her intent to prevent harm to him and anyone else.

The Wolf, provoked by Red's defiance and Lucian's secrets, taunts Red with hints of hidden truths and his own predatory hunger.

Lucian, troubled, warns Red that there are dark secrets between them, urging her not to bear burdens that aren't hers.

Red, however, insists on choosing mercy and standing her ground, declaring her willingness to share Lucian's burdens and face coming darkness together.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red plants her feet in the muck, her cloak flaring as she faces The Wolf head-on. Her eyes flick to Lucian—wary, but resolute—then back to the predator, her voice unwavering despite the tension crackling in the air. "If you want him, you'll have to go through me first. This ends here, Wolf. I won't let you hurt anyone else—not while I still stand." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf bares his teeth in a slow, mocking grin, circling just beyond her reach, his eyes never leaving Lucian's trembling form. "Brave words, little Red, but you know nothing of the hunger that drives me—or the secrets he keeps from you." ——The Wolf

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian tightens his grip on his axe, eyes flickering between Red's determined face and the Wolf's looming form. "Red, you don't know what you're protecting—there are truths between us darker than the forest itself." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red lifts her chin defiantly, her fists clenched at her sides as she blocks the path, her gaze unwavering despite the fear tightening her throat. "Maybe I don't know everything, but I know enough to stand between you both—because someone has to choose mercy when all you offer is blood." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf lowers his head, eyes glinting, muscles tensing as he circles closer, weighing Red's resolve against his own desperation. "Mercy is a luxury for those who have never starved, Red—and you may find the truth you defend will devour you faster than my jaws ever could." ——The Wolf

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian tightens his grip on his axe, eyes flicking between Red’s determined face and the Wolf’s prowling silhouette, torn between confession and protection. "Red, step back—mercy is noble, but it won’t shield you from what’s coming, and I won’t let you pay for my sins." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red squares her shoulders, chin lifted in defiance, as she glances back at Lucian, then fixes her unwavering gaze on the Wolf, her stance unyielding despite the tremor in her hands. "Then let me carry the weight with you, Lucian—if darkness is coming, we face it together, not as prey or predator, but as those who refuse to give in." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian struggles with his instinct to protect Red but ultimately relents, agreeing to let her take the lead while promising to intervene if necessary.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian's grip tightens and relaxes on the axe handle. He keeps his body between Red and the shadows beyond, but his eyes meet hers, searching for the certainty he’s struggling to find in himself. "You know I can't just stand by, Red. Every instinct I have tells me to keep you behind me, to make sure nothing gets close. But—damn it—I see the way you look at me. Like you need me to let you try. Just… if you’re sure about this, say it now. I need to hear it." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red meets his gaze steadily, her voice soft but unwavering, her hands clenched to hide the tremor of nerves as she steps just a little closer, bridging the space between them. "I am sure, Lucian—I need you to trust me, just this once, because I know what I'm walking into, and I won't let either of us down." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian’s grip on the axe tightens and loosens in turn, his jaw working as he forces himself to lower it another inch, eyes never leaving Red’s face. "You say that like it’s easy—to just stand aside and hope you’re right, when every part of me wants to pull you back, keep you safe, even if it means you hate me for it." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steadies her voice, meeting Lucian's gaze with quiet determination, her hand hovering near his arm but not touching, the space between them charged with both tension and trust. "I won't hate you for wanting to protect me, Lucian—but if you never let me step forward, I'll never be more than someone you have to save." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian's grip on the axe loosens as he steps back, jaw tight, eyes flicking between Red and the shadowed path, fighting the urge to shield her with his own body. "All right—I'll let you lead, but if things go sideways, I won't hesitate; you understand me?" ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

The Wolf circles, testing Red with riddles and insinuations, but Red meets his every word with steadfast courage and clever retorts, refusing to be intimidated.

The Wolf circles Red at a slow, deliberate pace, his gaze never leaving her face. His tail flicks, and he bares his teeth in what might be a smile—or a warning—as he closes the space between them, head lowering, voice silky and low. "My, my. out here all alone, are we? The woods are deep, you know. Dangerous for little ones who stray from the path." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, forcing her voice steady as her eyes track the Wolf’s slow, circling movements. "I know these woods better than you think, sir, and I’m not afraid of shadows—only of things that hide in them." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf leans in, his breath warm against Red's cheek, a slow, deliberate grin exposing the sharp gleam of his fangs. "Oh, but shadows are clever—they make friends of teeth and hunger and things that wear polite smiles." ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes never leaving the Wolf, her voice steady but her knuckles white against the wicker. "Still, I suppose even shadows forget themselves, sometimes—until something reminds them what’s waiting in the dark." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The Wolf pauses just behind Red, his breath warm on her neck, eyes fixed on the tremor of her pulse. "And what might you be, little one—reminder or meal?" ——The Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red stands her ground, voice steady but her hand tightens around the basket’s handle, eyes never leaving the Wolf as he circles closer. "I suppose that depends on whether you’re hunting, or merely hoping I’ll run." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The confrontation shifts as Red takes command, not only of her own fate but of the narrative between the three, determined to be neither prey nor pawn as the storm intensifies around them.

# Chapter 7: Red Rescues Grandmother and Makes Her Choice

Red pushes open the creaking cottage door, her cloak snagging on a splintered frame.

She scans the dim room and spots Grandmother bundled in a woolen blanket on the bed, her face pale but alert.

Red crosses the room quickly, kneeling beside Grandmother and pulling the blanket tighter around her shoulders.

She checks the latch on the window, ensuring it is locked, then searches the shelves for a flask of water and offers it to Grandmother.

Grandmother, motivated to reassure Red, clasps her granddaughter's hand and murmurs, 'You came just in time, child.

Grandmother squeezes Red's hand gently, her eyes shining with both relief and gratitude as she offers a weak but heartfelt smile. "Oh, my dear Red, you came just in time, child. I don't know what I would have done without you here. You are such a blessing to your old grandmother." ——Grandmother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red squeezes Grandmother's hand gently and leans in close, her eyes filled with concern and affection. "Oh, Grandmother, I'm so glad I made it—I'll always come when you need me." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

I knew you would.

Grandmother sits in her armchair, a gentle smile tugging at the corners of her lips as she gazes out the window, lost in thought. "Ah, I knew you would, my dear. You always did have a way of following your heart, no matter what anyone said." ——Grandmother

' Red listens for any sounds outside, her eyes darting to the shadowed corners, determined to secure the cottage and protect Grandmother.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 8: Resolution and A New Beginning

Red and Lucian stand by the split-rail fence, both aware of a growing sense of unease in the woods.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tugs her hood a little tighter, leaning casually against the fence, her gaze curious but warm as she tries to catch Lucian’s eyes. "You know, Lucian, you chop wood with the same determination you had when you pulled me out of that thicket last autumn. Are you preparing for another long night, or is something on your mind?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian pauses, wiping sweat from his brow, and glances over at Red with a half-smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes. "Old habits die hard, Red—besides, the forest’s been restless lately, and I’d rather be ready than sorry." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red leans in a little, her fingers tightening around the fence rail as her gaze flickers from Lucian's steady hands to the shadowed line of trees beyond. "Restless, you say?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian pauses, glancing toward the shadowed tree line, then sets another log on the pile with deliberate care. "Aye—tracks where they shouldn’t be, and too many eyes glittering in the dark after sunset." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, gripping the fence rail, her gaze fixed on the shadowed tree line as if expecting movement. "I noticed the crows have been circling closer to the village, too—makes me wonder if whatever’s out there is searching for more than just scraps." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian wipes sweat from his brow, glancing toward the shadowed treeline with a wary frown. "Whatever it is, it’s clever enough to know we’re watching, but bold enough not to care." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tightens her grip on the fence, her brows knitting together in concern as she glances toward the winding path leading to her grandmother's cottage. "That kind of boldness usually means trouble, Lucian—should I warn Grandmother to keep her lantern lit tonight?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian hefts another log onto the wheelbarrow, his gaze flickering toward the shadowed tree line as his jaw tightens with concern. "Aye, Red—tell her to keep the lantern burning, and her door barred; I’ll circle the edge of the woods before dusk, just to be certain." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

As Lucian stacks firewood, he and Red discuss strange signs—restless wildlife, unusual tracks, and circling crows—hinting at a new, more cunning threat.

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian gently presses the talisman into Red's palm, his calloused fingers lingering for a moment before letting go. He meets her gaze, earnest and protective, a faint smile tugging at the corners of his lips. "This isn't just a trinket, Red. I carved it from the heartwood of the old yew—the same tree that sheltered me when the storm came. The wolf stands for vigilance, for strength, for watching over those we care about. I want you to keep it close. If ever you find yourself lost in the woods, remember: you’re not alone." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red meets Lucian's gaze, her eyes shining with gratitude, before slipping the wolf talisman into a hidden pocket. "I close my fingers around the talisman, feeling the warmth of your care in its weight, and tuck it safely beneath my cloak, knowing your watchful spirit walks with me now." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian gifts Red a wolf-shaped talisman, carved from yew, symbolizing both protection and the bond between them.

Their conversation reveals a deepened trust and shared vigilance: Red acknowledges that the talisman carries not just luck, but a promise between them, and Lucian reassures her she is never alone.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red turns the talisman over in her palm, her fingers tracing the carved pattern. She looks up, searching Lucian's face, her voice quiet but steady. "Lucian, do you remember the first time you gave this to me? I didn’t understand then—what it truly meant. But now, every time I hold it, it feels heavier. Like it’s carrying more than just luck or protection. It’s like it’s holding a promise between us." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian's gaze softens as he reaches out, his hand hovering just above Red's, uncertain if he should touch the talisman or let her hold it a while longer. "I never meant for it to weigh on you, Red, only to remind you that you’re never alone in these woods—not while I still draw breath." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red traces her thumb over the carved symbol, her gaze flickering between Lucian's face and the silent shadows beyond them. "Maybe that's why I keep it close, even when I'm afraid—because it reminds me I'm not just surviving for myself anymore." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian reaches out, his callused fingers gently brushing Red's hand, steadying the talisman between them as if anchoring them both. "You carry it like I carry your trust—worn smooth by worry, but unbroken, and more precious for every trial it's seen." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

When Lucian suggests escorting Red to Grandmother’s, the conversation shifts to strategy—they debate possible paths, realizing the wolf anticipates their movements and that the obvious trails are now traps.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps forward to pick up the last log, her fingers accidentally brushing against Lucian’s as they both reach for it. She looks up, her cheeks warming, holding his gaze a moment longer than usual before smiling shyly. "Thank you, Lucian. I never realized how much work goes into preparing for winter—it’s easier with you here." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian smiles, their fingers lingering for a heartbeat as they lift the last log together, a quiet warmth settling between them. "It's easier with you too, Red—I never thought I'd look forward to company at the woodpile." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red meets Lucian's eyes for a moment, a soft smile playing on her lips as their hands touch over the last log. "Sometimes, I think the work feels lighter just because we’re together." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red insists they must avoid predictability and instead take an unconventional route, even if it’s more dangerous.

Together, they decide to cut through the brambles, trusting their instincts and resourcefulness over the familiar paths.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances down the shadowed path, her grip tightening on her basket as she looks back at Lucian, concern flickering in her eyes. "No, Lucian. It's not that simple. If we go that way, we'll be right in the open. The wolf knows these woods better than we do." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Red glances around, scanning the dense thicket for a safer path, her jaw set with determination. "We need to think like him, not just run where he expects." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red folds her arms tightly, gaze fixed on the shadowy path, her voice firm but edged with worry. "That's exactly why I can't agree—we'd be playing right into his claws." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Red folds her arms tightly, her gaze flickering toward the shadowed trees as if expecting movement. "If we make ourselves predictable, he'll hunt us down before we even reach the river." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances anxiously at the tangled shadows between the trees, her grip tightening on her basket. "I shook my head because every path he expects us to take is a trap—I can feel it." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian narrows his eyes, scanning the shadowed trees for any hint of a hidden trail. "So, unless we find a way he wouldn't anticipate, we're just leading ourselves into danger." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances toward a dense, tangled patch of brambles, her jaw set with determination. "That's why we need to trust our instincts, not just the trails—maybe there's a way through the thicket he wouldn't dare follow." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucian (The Woodsman)Lucian gestures toward the dense undergrowth, determination sharpening his gaze. "Then let's cut through the brambles, Red—if it's rough for us, it'll slow him too." ——Lucian (The Woodsman)

Red sets off toward Grandmother’s, Lucian promising to guard her, both determined to outwit the lurking danger.
