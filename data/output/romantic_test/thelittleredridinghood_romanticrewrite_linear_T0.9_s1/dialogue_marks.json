Red's Mother, her hands dusted with flour, folds a parchment invitation and tucks it into the basket along with a fresh loaf, emphasizing the need for caution on the forest path. Driven by her longing for independence, Red snatches the basket, promises to be vigilant, and steps onto the stone path, scanning the forest for movement. Her mother watches from the doorway, arms crossed, calling after Red to remember her lessons. The outcome is Red setting off toward Grandmother's cottage, with a clear objective to deliver the invitation and provisions, while her mother reinforces the importance of responsibility through her specific actions and words.",
