Red's Mother, her hands dusted with flour, folds a parchment invitation and tucks it into the basket along with a fresh loaf, emphasizing the need for caution on the forest path. Driven by her longing for independence, Red snatches the basket, promises to be vigilant, and steps onto the stone path, scanning the forest for movement. Her mother watches from the doorway, arms crossed, calling after Red to remember her lessons. The outcome is Red setting off toward Grandmother's cottage, with a clear objective to deliver the invitation and provisions, while her mother reinforces the importance of responsibility through her specific actions and words.",

The Wolf, emerging from the shadows, warns her of the dangers lurking in the woods, his tone more ominous and protective than flirtatious. Red responds firmly, referencing her mother’s advice and her own instincts, demonstrating confidence and independence. She expresses concern for her grandmother, revealing her motivation for the journey. The Wolf probes for details about Grandmother’s location and, rather than simply suggesting company, emphasizes his knowledge of the woods and offers to guide Red, framing himself as a protector rather than a mere curious companion. Red remains guarded but does not outright refuse the Wolf’s company, leaving ambiguity about whether she accepts his help. The encounter shifts in tone: the Wolf’s approach is less playful and more foreboding, and Red’s motivation is both compassionate (for Grandmother) and assertive. Their exchange is marked by mutual wariness, with Red carefully maintaining her boundaries. The chapter ends with Red moving forward, determined and alert, while the Wolf lingers nearby, his intentions unclear but his desire for connection still present, now tempered by an air of mystery and caution.",

Inside, Grandmother, busy stirring a pot of herbal tea, pauses and peers through the window. She unbolts the door, her gaze wary but welcoming. The Wolf bows his head, tail low, and speaks in a deep, careful voice: 'Good day, wise one. I come seeking shelter and perhaps a word with Red.' Grandmother narrows her eyes, gripping her cane firmly, and replies, 'Visitors are expected, but not all are trusted. State your intentions.' The Wolf, ears flicking, sits back on his haunches and promises, 'I mean no harm. I seek only to understand, and perhaps to belong.' Grandmother gestures for him to sit by the threshold, keeping the door half-closed, establishing clear boundaries. The Wolf sits quietly, his nose twitching at the aroma of rosemary and boiling roots, while Grandmother prepares another cup of tea, watching him closely. As their cautious conversation unfolds, the Wolf attempts to reassure Grandmother of his intentions by offering a basket of goods and claiming to bring a message from Little Red, which Grandmother tests by asking for the exact words. The Wolf recites Little Red's secret message correctly, earning a measure of trust. Grandmother, still wary but swayed by the Wolf's gesture and knowledge, allows him to remain by the threshold, granting a cautious audience while keeping her guard up. The Wolf must continue to prove his trustworthiness before he is allowed entry.",

Red turns, standing her ground. She tucks the mushroom into her basket and replies, 'Neither—I’m learning. Are you following me?' The Wolf grins, stepping forward to sniff the mushrooms. His nose twitches. 'Curiosity is a dangerous habit here.' As Red straightens, she points her walking stick at a patch of brambles. 'I know the safe trails. But maybe you can show me a shortcut.' The Wolf, sensing her challenge, darts ahead and nudges aside a low branch to open a new path. Red hesitates, then follows. Together, they slip off the main trail, branches brushing Red’s cloak and The Wolf’s fur as they push deeper into the woods. Their objective: to discover a quicker way to Grandmother’s house, and test whether trust can be built between them. The outcome: Red collects a rare herb she couldn’t have found alone, while The Wolf gains her wary companionship for the journey ahead.",

Grandmother, wise and cautious, instructs Red to lock the door and stay alert to the Wolf's true nature.
