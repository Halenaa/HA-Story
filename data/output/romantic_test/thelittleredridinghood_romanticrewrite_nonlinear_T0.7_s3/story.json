Lucien, standing nearby, adjusts his coat and quietly stacks firewood by the door, glancing toward Red for approval but keeping a respectful distance. Suddenly, Hunter strides into the clearing, boots thudding, cloak brushing low branches, his sharp gaze flicking from Lucien to Red. Hunter plants himself between them, demanding to know Lucien's purpose with a short, gruff question. Red steps forward, gripping her basket and explaining her delivery for Grandmother, her voice firm but wary. Lucien meets Hunter's suspicion by offering to help carry supplies inside, his hands open and visible. Hunter watches Lucien's movements, not convinced, and insists on accompanying them to the door, casting frequent glances at Lucien. Red nods, ushering Lucien forward, determined to fulfill her task and maintain control of the situation. The three move together toward the cottage, the crunch of leaves and creak of the cottage gate marking their uneasy alliance.",

She paused abruptly as a twig snapped nearby, her hand tightening around the basket’s handle. Lucien emerged from the shadow of an ancient oak, dusting leaf litter from his jacket and offering a cautious, quiet greeting. Red kept a measured distance, eyeing Lucien’s unfamiliar clothing and the travel pack slung over his shoulder. Lucien, motivated by his longing for connection and trust, gently asked about the direction to the nearest cottage, his gaze lingering on Red’s basket. Red, recalling her mother’s warnings, responded with guarded politeness, declining to share details. She watched Lucien’s hands as he gestured towards the winding paths, his tone earnest but wary. After a brief exchange, Red decided to continue along her route but kept Lucien in sight, her curiosity piqued by his peculiar manners and careful movements. Lucien, sensing Red’s caution, refrained from following closely, instead calling out, 'I mean no harm, miss—perhaps we could walk together if your way allows.' Red weighed the offer, then nodded once, keeping several paces ahead. The result was a tentative companionship, with both characters moving forward on the trail, neither fully trusting yet compelled by their respective missions.",

Red nods, pulling her red cloak tighter, her hands brushing against the rough weave. She lifts the basket, its weight pressing into her palms, and steps toward the door. Her mother rests a hand on Red’s shoulder, scanning her face for understanding before releasing her, intent on ensuring both her own mother's health and Red’s safe passage. Red steps outside, boots crunching on damp earth, her senses filled with the scent of pine and distant woodsmoke, determined to fulfill her mother’s instructions and reach her grandmother’s cottage.",

Grandmother waves him inside, gestures to the kettle steaming on the stove, and questions him about his journey, her fingers tightening on her cane as she appraises his intentions.

He paused, glancing at Red with a half-smile, and gestured toward a barely visible side trail veiled by brambles. 'There's a brook just this way,' he offered, voice low and inviting, 'the water's clearer than anywhere else in the forest.' Red hesitated, eyeing the hidden path. Lucien crouched to clear away some overhanging vines, his fingers deft and confident, then looked back, encouraging. Driven by curiosity and Lucien’s gentle insistence, Red followed, her boots sinking into the mossy ground. Lucien led the way, pointing out wild strawberries growing in the shade, and picked one, offering it to Red. She took it, brushing his fingers, and tasted the berry’s tartness. As they walked, the sunlight flickered through the canopy, and Lucien shared the sound of the brook ahead. Their footsteps softened on the damp earth, the hush broken only by the gurgle of water. Red, motivated to reach her grandmother but drawn by Lucien’s presence, allowed the detour, her eyes scanning the unfamiliar woods. Lucien, intent on winning her trust, slowed his pace, matching hers, and kept up a gentle conversation about the forest’s secrets. The objective of the scene—Lucien steering Red off her usual route—was achieved, and the subtle shift in their relationship was marked by Red accepting the berry and choosing to follow.",

Lucien, voice low and hands fidgeting at his sleeves, confesses he overheard Red speaking to the Hunter earlier and followed her trail, seeking companionship. Red sets her basket on the stone steps and moves closer, studying Lucien’s posture and the stammer in his words. She demands to know why he concealed his true intentions. Lucien lifts his chin and steps back, boots scraping on the moss, admitting he feared rejection and loneliness. Red, sensing the tension, glances at the cottage door, then deliberately knocks, calling for Grandmother. Lucien watches, shoulders slumped, as Red places herself between him and the entrance, determined to protect her family and uncover the truth.",

She demands to know why he followed her path and what secrets he hides, her voice steady but low. Lucien, shifting his weight, reaches into his pocket and produces the scrap of red cloth he found earlier, offering it as proof of his intentions. He confesses he was drawn by loneliness and curiosity, not malice, his voice catching. Red listens, glancing at the cloth, then back at Lucien, weighing his words. She takes a deliberate step closer, meeting his gaze, and asks for the whole truth before she can trust him any further. The wind stirs the hem of her cloak, and in the hush that follows, Lucien finally admits he has no family but wishes for connection, especially with her. The tension eases as Red nods, signaling a fragile truce, but she keeps her basket within reach, still cautious. Birds call overhead, and the distant sound of an axe splits the quiet, hinting at another presence nearby.",
