# Chapter 6: A Hunter’s Arrival Forces a Choice

Red arrives at the cottage path, basket in hand, boots crunching on wet leaves as she scans for signs of her grandmother.

Lucien, standing nearby, is engaged in a tense exchange with Hunter, who confronts Lucien directly about his intentions regarding Red and the truth he claims to possess.

Their conversation reveals that Lucien is not simply a helpful outsider but someone who believes Red deserves to know information that Hunter may be withholding from her.

Hunter remains deeply suspicious, warning that some truths may be harmful, and insists on keeping Lucien under close watch.

Hunter steps forward, blocking Lucien's path with a squared stance and narrowed eyes, his posture radiating distrust and a readiness to defend. "What are you doing here, Lucien? State your business—now." ——Hunter

Lucien's gaze never flinches from Hunter, his voice low but edged with challenge. "I'm here to make sure she knows the truth—no matter how much you want to keep it from her." ——Lucien

Hunter squares his shoulders, blocking Lucien's advance, eyes narrowed and jaw clenched in warning. "Truth's a sharp blade in the wrong hands—so you'd better tell me what you think she needs cutting with." ——Hunter

Lucien's eyes narrow, his tone calm but edged with challenge as he steps forward, refusing to be intimidated by Hunter's stance. "You call it a blade, but for her it's a key—one you can't keep hidden forever." ——Lucien

Hunter squares his shoulders, his eyes locked on Lucien, tension crackling in the charged silence between them. "If you're so sure it's a key, then let's hear what doors you think it'll open—because I won't let you wreck her just to settle some old score." ——Hunter

Lucien's jaw tightens, his gaze steady and unwavering as he steps closer, refusing to back down. "I'm not here for vengeance, Hunter—I'm here because she deserves to choose her own path, not live in the shadows you cast." ——Lucien

Hunter steps closer, his stance rigid, eyes locked onto Lucien with unwavering intensity. "You talk about shadows, but some truths burn brighter than she can bear—so unless you want her hurt, you'll tread carefully." ——Hunter

Lucien's gaze hardens, voice low but unwavering, as tension crackles between them. "Then maybe it's time she learned to stand in the light, no matter how much it hurts." ——Lucien

Red, meanwhile, asserts her own determination to care for her grandmother, undeterred by the tension between the two men.

Red tightens her grip on the basket, eyes flicking toward the Hunter with a mix of caution and determination, as she steps a little closer to the path. "I'm just on my way to visit my Grandmother. She's unwell, so I’ve brought her some food and medicine from the village. I know these woods can be dangerous, but I promised her I’d come, and I don't want to let her down." ——Red

Hunter lowers his axe, studying Red’s determined face before glancing warily at the shadowed trees. "You’re brave to come through these woods alone, but caution is wise—there’ve been strange signs lately, and not all who wander here have good intentions." ——Hunter

Red tightens her grip on the basket, meeting the Hunter’s eyes with determined resolve, though a hint of nervousness flickers in her posture. "I understand, and I’ll keep my wits about me, but my Grandmother is counting on me, so I can’t turn back now." ——Red

HunterRed looks up at the Hunter, her grip tightening on the basket as she scans the shadowy trees for movement. "If you know a safer path, I’d appreciate your guidance—my Grandmother’s cottage isn’t far, but I’d rather not risk a wrong turn." ——Hunter

Red looks the Hunter in the eye, weighing his trustworthiness as she tightens her grip on the basket and gestures down the shadowy path. "I know the way well enough, but if you’re willing to walk with me, perhaps we’ll both feel safer from whatever’s been lurking here." ——Red

Hunter shoulders his axe and steps beside Red, scanning the underbrush as they move forward together. "Very well, Red—let’s keep our eyes open and our voices low, for these woods listen as much as they hide." ——Hunter

Despite the undercurrent of mistrust, Red invites both Hunter and Lucien to accompany her, reasoning that their combined presence may offer greater safety given the recent dangers in the woods.

Lucien holds his hands out in front of him, palms open, taking a careful step forward but waiting for Hunter's response before moving closer. "Hey, Hunter. Let me give you a hand with those supplies—looks like you've got your arms full. See? Nothing up my sleeves." ——Lucien

Hunter shifts his weight, keeping his eyes locked on Lucien, the supplies clutched close to his chest. "Hunter: That's real generous of you, Lucien, but folks don't usually offer help around here without wanting something in return—so what's your angle?" ——Hunter

Lucien keeps his palms open, stepping back to give Hunter space and showing he's not making any sudden moves. "Lucien: Fair question—I'm just trying to pull my weight since I'm new here, and figured it was better to earn trust than sit on my hands." ——Lucien

Hunter shifts the supplies to one arm, keeping a careful eye on Lucien as he gestures for him to follow, but doesn't hand anything over. "Hunter: Trust isn't earned in a day, Lucien, and I don't make a habit of letting strangers near our stores—so why don't you walk with me while I finish, and we'll see how much help you're really looking to give." ——Hunter

Hunter agrees to walk with Red, keeping a vigilant eye on Lucien, who attempts to prove his good intentions by volunteering to help with supplies.

Hunter falls into step beside Lucien, arms crossed and eyes narrowed, watching Lucien closely with every step. "I'll walk you to the door, Lucien. No offense, but I like to be sure about things." ——Hunter

Lucien forces a polite smile, subtly shifting his weight as he heads toward the door, eyes flicking to Hunter's wary expression. "Of course, Hunter—whatever makes you comfortable." ——Lucien

Hunter narrows their eyes, lingering just a step behind Lucien, watching every subtle gesture. "You seem awfully eager to get moving—anything in particular got you in a rush?" ——Hunter

Lucien offers a small, practiced smile, but his fingers fidget with the strap of his bag, betraying a flicker of unease. "Just trying to respect your time, that's all—no hidden motives here." ——Lucien

Hunter narrows their eyes, pausing mid-step and fixing Lucien with a pointed stare. "Funny, because every time I look away, you look like you're sizing up the exits." ——Hunter

Lucien offers a tight smile, subtly shifting their weight toward the hallway, hands tucked into their pockets as if seeking comfort. "If I seem restless, it's only because your scrutiny could make anyone a little uneasy." ——Lucien

Hunter narrows his eyes, slowing his pace to keep Lucien directly in front of him as they approach the door. "Hunter: Maybe, but I’ve learned that uneasy people usually have something to hide." ——Hunter

Lucien offers a tight smile, hands tucked in his pockets, eyes flicking briefly to the door before meeting Hunter's gaze. "Or maybe some people just don't like being treated like suspects, Hunter." ——Lucien

Hunter steps closer, blocking Lucien's path just enough to make the invitation a challenge rather than a request, eyes never leaving Lucien's face. "Then prove me wrong—walk slow, stay in sight, and let's see if that nervous energy of yours settles down." ——Hunter

Lucien forces a measured, deliberate stride, glancing at Hunter with a strained half-smile as they walk, hands visible and posture tense. "Fine, if it puts your mind at ease, I'll match your pace—no sudden moves, just the door ahead." ——Lucien

However, the dynamic remains wary, with Hunter openly questioning Lucien's motives and demanding transparency as they all approach the cottage together, the uneasy alliance marked by unresolved questions and a fragile sense of trust.

# Chapter 2: Red Meets the Mysterious Stranger in the Woods

Red stepped lightly along the winding forest trail, her basket balanced on one arm, boots brushing aside dew-laden ferns.

She paused abruptly as a twig snapped nearby, her hand tightening around the basket’s handle.

Lucien emerged from the shadow of an ancient oak, dusting leaf litter from his jacket and offering a cautious, quiet greeting.

Lucien keeps his hands visible, voice low but urgent, eyes scanning the dim treeline as he steps fully into the open, careful not to make any sudden moves. "Evening. Sorry to startle you—I didn't mean to intrude. There's. something you ought to know, and I couldn't risk being overheard." ——Lucien

Unlike a casual encounter, Lucien's demeanor was urgent and conspiratorial—he hinted at secrets and dangers, speaking in hushed tones about risks and loyalties.

Red, though cautious and guided by her mother’s warnings, found herself drawn into Lucien’s veiled conversation.

Lucien offers a gentle smile, his tone warm but tinged with vulnerability, and his eyes flicker between Red's face and the basket, as if hoping for reassurance or an invitation. "Excuse me, I couldn’t help but notice you seem to know your way through these woods. I’ve been wandering a while, searching for a cottage nearby—I suppose I’m also searching for a friendly face. That basket you carry looks quite special—are you heading there yourself? Perhaps you could point me in the right direction?" ——Lucien

Red tightens her grip on the basket, her eyes studying Lucien with cautious curiosity. "I am, but it's not far—just beyond the old birch grove; I can show you the path if you'd like, though I don't usually walk with strangers." ——Red

As they walked, Lucien confessed that their meeting was no mere coincidence: he was on the run from a group called the Circle, and his search for connection was entangled with betrayals and moral crossroads.

Red offers a small, polite smile, her posture subtly shifting as she keeps her hands folded in her lap, signaling her unwillingness to divulge more. "I appreciate your interest, Lucien, but I'd rather not talk about it. My mother always said some things are better kept to oneself." ——Red

Lucien leans forward slightly, his tone gentle but probing, eyes searching Red's face for any sign of hesitation. "Of course, Red, though sometimes sharing a little can lighten the burden—are you certain there's nothing you wish to tell me?" ——Lucien

Red glances away, her fingers tracing patterns in the dirt, signaling her resolve to remain silent. "I'm sure, Lucien; it's just safer this way." ——Red

Red, initially guarded, pressed Lucien for the truth, challenging him about the risks and consequences of associating with him.

Their dialogue shifted from polite wariness to open negotiation about trust, loyalty, and the possibility of exile from their respective communities.

By the end of the encounter, Red understood that agreeing to walk with Lucien meant risking her standing with the Circle, and potentially her family, while refusing meant abandoning a chance at a deeper, though dangerous, connection.

Lucien stands back, hands visible and relaxed, making no move to approach, his tone gentle and respectful as he addresses Red across the small gap between them. "Pardon me, miss—I can see you're wary, and rightly so these days. I mean no harm, truly. If our paths align, perhaps we could walk together for a bit? But if you'd rather keep your distance, I understand." ——Lucien

RedShe slowed her pace just enough to keep Lucien in her peripheral vision, one hand resting near the hidden knife at her belt. "Red glanced over her shoulder, eyes narrowed, and replied, 'People who mean no harm don't usually announce it—what do you want, really?'" ——Red

Lucien slows his pace, maintaining a respectful distance, his hands visible and open at his sides. "Fair point, Red—I'm just passing through and conversation beats silence, but if you'd rather be left alone, I'll respect that." ——Lucien

The result was a tense, pivotal choice—Red, now aware of the stakes, must decide whether to join Lucien in defiance or part ways, with both futures carrying heavy costs.

Red slows their stride just enough to glance back over their shoulder, eyes narrowed, voice low but steady. "I get what you’re saying, Lucien, but you have to know this isn’t an easy yes for me. What exactly are you asking me to risk here? Because from where I’m standing, it feels like there’s more you’re not telling me." ——Red

Lucien steps closer, lowering his tone, the tension tangible as he waits for Red’s response. "Lucien’s gaze flickers, his voice low: 'You’re right, Red—I haven’t laid it all out, but if you walk with me on this, we both stand to lose more than just our skins; we’re gambling with loyalties that can’t be undone.'" ——Lucien

Red slows his stride, watching Lucien carefully, his jaw tight with uncertainty. "So if I say yes, Lucien, I need to know who exactly we’re betraying—and whether it’s worth burning every bridge left to us." ——Red

LucienHe meets Red's eyes, searching for resolve, his hands clenched tight at his sides. "Lucien hesitates, then replies, 'If we take this path, we're turning our backs on the Circle, and once done, there's no crawling back—are you ready for that kind of exile?'" ——Lucien

Red slows his pace, glancing sidelong at Lucien, searching his face for any hint of reassurance or regret. "Red's jaw tightens, the weight of Lucien's words settling in; 'And if I say no, what happens to us—do we become enemies, or just ghosts to each other?'" ——Red

LucienHe stops, shoulders tense, waiting for Red's answer in the silence between them. "Lucien's eyes soften, regret flickering across his face: 'If you say no, Red, I let you walk away—but you’ll always wonder what might’ve been if you'd chosen me over them.'" ——Lucien

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mission from Her Mother

Red’s mother stands beside the wood-burning stove, slicing a loaf of bread with deliberate care.

She wraps the warm slices and a jar of broth in cloth, placing them into a wicker basket as Red watches.

As she ties the basket shut, she gestures for Red to listen, her voice firm but gentle: 'Stay on the path.

Red’s MotherShe finishes tying the basket and places her hands gently on Red's shoulders, meeting her eyes with a look of loving concern. "Red, before you go, I want you to listen carefully. Stay on the path—no matter what you see or hear in the woods. Do you understand? Promise me you'll remember what I said." ——Red’s Mother

Red clutches the basket tighter and looks up into her mother's worried eyes, sensing the seriousness behind her gentle words. "I promise, Mother—I’ll stay right on the path, I won’t let anything distract me." ——Red

Don’t talk to anyone you don’t know.

Red’s MotherShe kneels down, tucking the edge of Red’s hood under her chin, her eyes full of worry and care. "Red, remember what I told you: don’t talk to anyone you don’t know on your way to Grandma’s house. There are people out there who aren’t as kind as they seem." ——Red’s Mother

Red tightens her grip on the basket and flashes a reassuring smile, eager but slightly distracted by the thought of the woods ahead. "I know, Mama—I’ll go straight there and won’t stop for anyone, I promise." ——Red

' Red nods, pulling her red cloak tighter, her hands brushing against the rough weave.

She lifts the basket, its weight pressing into her palms, and steps toward the door.

Her mother rests a hand on Red’s shoulder, scanning her face for understanding before releasing her, intent on ensuring both her own mother's health and Red’s safe passage.

Red steps outside, boots crunching on damp earth, her senses filled with the scent of pine and distant woodsmoke, determined to fulfill her mother’s instructions and reach her grandmother’s cottage.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Lucien Reaches Grandmother’s House First

Lucien, cloak damp and hair plastered to his forehead, knocks briskly on the cottage door, glancing over his shoulder at the winding path.

Grandmother, wrapped in a faded shawl, opens the door, her voice gentle but wary.

Grandmother pulls her shawl tighter around her shoulders, peering through the doorway with a soft, searching gaze, her hands trembling just slightly as she steps aside to let the visitor enter. "Oh, my dear, is that you? The night’s chill finds its way in so easily these days. Come in, come in—but mind your shoes. I wasn't expecting anyone at this hour." ——Grandmother

Lucien bows his head and offers a basket of wild herbs he gathered, explaining he met Red on the road and came ahead to ensure Grandmother was safe.

Lucien bows his head respectfully and sets the basket of fragrant herbs on the table, his eyes scanning the cottage for any sign of distress. "Grandmother, please forgive my unexpected arrival. On my way here, I met Red—she was just behind me, eager as ever to reach you. The woods felt uneasy today, so I hurried ahead to make certain all was well. I gathered these wild herbs for you along the path; I hope they bring you comfort. Your safety means a great deal to me, and I could not rest until I was sure you were unharmed." ——Lucien

Grandmother waves him inside, gestures to the kettle steaming on the stove, and questions him about his journey, her fingers tightening on her cane as she appraises his intentions.

Grandmother waves him inside, eyes sharp despite her gentle smile, her fingers drumming softly against her cane as she watches his every move. "Come in, dear—don’t let the chill follow you. The kettle’s just about ready. You must be tired from your travels. Tell me, what brought you all the way out here today?" ——Grandmother

Lucien steps across the threshold, places the herbs by the hearth, and sits where directed, his eyes scanning the window for any sign of Red.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Lucien Diverts Red with a Tempting Detour

Red, adjusting the basket on her arm, eyes the winding path ahead with uncertainty.

Lucien steps lightly beside her, brushing aside a branch and revealing a bramble-covered side trail.

Sensing Red's hesitation, Lucien reassures her, clearing the way and encouraging her gently.

Red, torn between caution and curiosity, questions the wisdom of leaving the main path, but finds herself compelled by the allure of discovery and Lucien’s companionship.

She expresses her inner conflict aloud, reflecting on bravery and the unknown.

Red stands at the edge of the overgrown trail, glancing back over their shoulder before shifting their weight uncertainly. "Is this really the best way? What if there's a reason it's hidden. I can't tell if I'm being cautious or just scared." ——Red

Red shifts their weight from foot to foot, glancing nervously down the overgrown trail. "But if I turn back now, I'll never know what's waiting beyond." ——Red

Red takes a tentative step toward the path, glancing over their shoulder one last time. "Still, every story worth telling has a moment like this—maybe this is mine." ——Red

Lucien responds with warmth, offering her wild strawberries and comforting her doubts with his attentiveness.

Lucien gestures warmly over his shoulder, offering a reassuring smile as he holds the vines aside, making space for his companion to follow. "It's all clear now—come on, I’ve got you. Just watch your step here." ——Lucien

As they walk, Lucien shares stories of the forest’s hidden wonders, speaking of the ancient Heartwood tree and the subtle magic woven through the woods.

Red’s curiosity grows, and the two engage in a mutual exchange—Red offering to show Lucien where she’s seen the glowing moss, deepening their trust.

Lucien crouches by the leafy patch, carefully plucks a bright wild strawberry, and holds it out to Red, his open palm inviting and gentle, a small smile softening his features. "Here, Red—these are the sweetest ones. You have to try it." ——Lucien

Red hesitates with a crooked smile, eyes flicking from Lucien’s open palm to his face, fingers curling shyly before accepting the berry. "Are you sure? You always find the best spots—what if I eat it and you miss out?" ——Red

LucienHe smiles softly, holding out the tiny berry, his fingertips stained red from picking. "Lucien: I don't mind at all—seeing you enjoy it is better than any taste for me." ——Lucien

Red grins shyly, accepting the strawberry from Lucien's hand, their fingers brushing for a brief, warm moment. "Red: Well, if you're sure—just don't blame me if I end up wanting all your secret finds." ——Red

Their connection strengthens as they listen together to the brook and share in the mysteries of the forest, each inviting the other into secrets both natural and personal.

The objective of the scene—Lucien steering Red off her usual route while building intimacy and trust—is achieved, with Red’s agency and curiosity more verbally expressed, and Lucien’s openness reciprocated.

Lucien slows his pace, tilting his head to catch the shimmering sound, his eyes bright with curiosity as he glances at Red. "Do you hear that, Red? The brook’s singing—like it’s calling us closer. It always amazes me, how even the quietest places have their own kind of music." ——Lucien

Red tilts her head, listening, and lets a small smile break through as she glances over at him, curiosity brightening her eyes. "I hear it, Lucien—it's like the trees are letting the water borrow their voice for a while." ——Red

Lucien slows his pace, tilting his head as if tuning in to the brook’s melody, inviting Red to do the same. "Maybe if we listen closely enough, we’ll catch a story the water wants to tell us." ——Lucien

Red slows her steps, tilting her head to better catch the layered sounds, her gaze flicking to Lucien with a quiet smile. "If we’re patient, maybe the brook will trust us with its secrets." ——Red

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red Arrives and Uncovers the Deception

Red approaches the cottage, carrying her basket, keenly aware of Lucien lingering at the doorstep with a muddied coat and anxious demeanor.

Her curiosity and suspicion sharpen as she questions Lucien about how he found the secluded path so easily.

Red stands squarely in front of the door, her gaze unwavering as she studies Lucien's face for any flicker of dishonesty. "Lucien, you said you just stumbled upon this place, but I've lived here all my life and even the villagers barely remember its path. How did you find the cottage so quickly? I promised my mother I'd protect her secrets, and I need to know I can trust you." ——Red

LucienHe steps lightly over a mossy root, pausing as if weighing how much more to reveal. "Lucien's eyes flicker, a trace of something hidden in his gaze as he answers, 'Sometimes the woods remember those who listen, Red, and your mother's secrets aren't the only ones that linger here.'" ——Lucien

Red steps closer, her voice low and unwavering, refusing to let him dodge her question. "Then tell me, Lucien—what secrets do the woods whisper to you that even I don't know?" ——Red

LucienHe glances toward the shadowed corners of the cottage, as if expecting the woods themselves to lean in closer to their conversation. "Lucien's voice softens, edged with caution: 'They whisper of old bargains and promises broken, Red—things that drew me here long before you ever saw me in the trees.'" ——Lucien

Red steps closer, her eyes searching Lucien's face for any sign of truth or deception, her hand unconsciously tightening around the locket at her throat. "If that's true, then what promise did you make—and to whom—that leads you to my door now?" ——Red

LucienHe glances away, fingers tracing the worn edge of the doorframe, as if weighing how much more to reveal. "Lucien hesitates, his jaw tightening as he finally admits, 'A promise to a woman with crimson eyes—one who begged me to watch over you when shadows gather.'" ——Lucien

Red narrows her eyes, stepping closer, her hand tightening around the basket's worn handle as she studies Lucien's every reaction. "My mother sent you, then—but if you truly came to watch over me, why hide in the shadows instead of standing at my side?" ——Red

Lucien glances toward the darkening woods, every muscle taut as if listening for footsteps that only he can hear. "Because sometimes the shadows are safer than the light, Red—and there are things hunting you now that would see me before they ever saw you." ——Lucien

Red squares her shoulders, her gaze unwavering as she takes a resolute step toward Lucien, daring him to move from the edge of shadow into her trust. "If danger is that close, Lucien, then step into the light with me—because I won't let fear drive me from my mother's promise." ——Red

Instead of a simple confession of following her out of a need for companionship, Lucien speaks in riddles about the woods remembering old secrets and bargains, hinting at a deeper, possibly supernatural connection to the place and to Red’s family.

Lucien glances down, his fingers twisting nervously at his sleeves, voice trembling with honesty as he waits for Red’s reaction. "Red. I— I hope you don’t mind me saying this. Earlier, I overheard you talking with the Hunter near the old mill. You seemed. like you had a plan, and he kept asking if you’d go alone. I— I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but I just. I followed your trail after. I guess I wanted to be near someone. Sometimes, it’s hard not to feel like I’m just a shadow in the background." ——Lucien

Red steps closer, her voice gentle, and offers Lucien a reassuring smile, her hand hesitating before resting lightly on his arm. "Lucien, you’re not just a shadow to me—if you heard us, then you know I wanted someone I could trust beside me, not just to chase after the wolf, but to not be alone in all this." ——Red

Lucien looks down, twisting his sleeve tighter, voice trembling just a little as he glances up to gauge Red's reaction. "I heard him warn you about the danger, saying you shouldn't trust anyone out here—not even me—and I realized how much I needed you to trust me, even if I don't know how to ask for it." ——Lucien

Red steps closer, her voice steady but gentle, reaching out to rest a reassuring hand on Lucien’s arm. "You don’t have to ask, Lucien—trust is something we build together, and right now, I’d rather face the woods with you than with anyone else." ——Red

As Red presses, Lucien reveals he was drawn by a promise made to a mysterious woman with crimson eyes, whose request was to watch over Red as danger gathers.

Red realizes her mother may have sent Lucien, but is unsettled by his secrecy.

Red stands rigid, arms crossed tightly, her voice trembling with both anger and hurt as she faces Lucien, searching his eyes for answers. "Lucien, I deserve the truth. Why did you hide what you were really after? All this time, I trusted you—and you let me believe it was real. Was any of it?" ——Red

Lucien averts his gaze, guilt flickering across his face as he struggles for the right words. "Red, it was never my intention to hurt you—I hid my purpose because I feared losing you if you saw the whole truth." ——Lucien

Red's voice trembles as she steps closer, her eyes searching his face for any sign of honesty. "Fear isn't an excuse for betrayal, Lucien—I need to know if anything between us was ever genuine." ——Red

Lucien averts his gaze, guilt tightening his jaw as he struggles to meet Red's eyes. "Red, what I felt for you was real, but the mission came first—I thought I could have both, and I was wrong." ——Lucien

Red takes a shaky breath, her hands clenched at her sides as she searches his face for any sign of remorse. "So I was just collateral damage to your mission—was I ever more to you than a means to an end?" ——Red

Lucien's voice trembles as he finally meets Red's gaze, the weight of his confession hanging between them. "Red, you became everything to me, and that's why I tried so desperately to protect you from the truth—even when it meant betraying myself." ——Lucien

Their conversation grows more intimate and vulnerable, both confessing fears of loneliness and betrayal.

Lucien lifts his chin, eyes flickering to Red, then drops his gaze as he steps back; his boots scrape softly on the moss, the admission hanging heavy in the quiet. "I know I always act like nothing can touch me, but the truth is—I’ve been afraid. Not of danger, not really, but of being turned away. Of ending up alone because I wasn’t. enough." ——Lucien

Red shifts closer, gaze softening, voice low but steady as they meet Lucien's eyes. "I get it, Lucien—sometimes I feel like if I let anyone see how much I care, they'll just walk away, too." ——Red

Lucien glances over at Red, hope flickering in his eyes as he lets his guard down a little further. "Maybe we're both just waiting for someone to stay, flaws and all." ——Lucien

Red offers a tentative smile, meeting Lucien's gaze with a flicker of hope in their eyes. "Maybe we could try staying—for each other—just to see what happens." ——Red

Lucien admits he overheard Red’s conversation with the Hunter and followed her, not just to protect her, but because he longs for trust and connection.

Red hesitates for a moment, her knuckles rapping firmly on the wooden door as she peers at the window, searching for any sign of movement inside. "Grandmother? It's me, Red. Are you alright in there?" ——Red

GrandmotherA shadow flickers behind the curtains as Grandmother's voice wavers, softer and huskier than Red remembers. "Come in, dear—I'm just resting in bed, but my voice might sound a bit strange today." ——Grandmother

Red hesitates on the threshold, her hand still gripping the doorknob as she peers anxiously into the dim room. "Are you sure you're alright, Grandmother? You sound different, and the door was locked." ——Red

Grandmother shifts under the covers, her figure unusually still, eyes glinting in the dim light as she gestures weakly for Red to approach. "Oh, don't worry, child—just a touch of the cold, and I locked the door for safety; do come closer so I can see you better." ——Grandmother

RedShe steps inside slowly, clutching her basket tighter, scanning the shadowed corners of the room. "Red hesitates at the threshold, her eyes narrowing, 'Why is it so dark in here, Grandmother?'" ——Red

Grandmother shifts beneath the covers, her outline oddly large and indistinct in the gloom. "The shutters were rattling all morning, dear, so I kept them closed—come closer so I can hear your sweet voice." ——Grandmother

RedShe scans the dim room, searching for any sign of movement beyond the bed. "Red steps forward slowly, her grip tightening on her basket, 'If you're unwell, should I fetch the doctor, Grandmother?'" ——Red

Grandmother's hand, pale and oddly large, emerges from beneath the quilt, beckoning Red closer while her eyes glint strangely in the gloom. "There's no need for a doctor, my precious—just bring yourself nearer so I can hold your hand." ——Grandmother

RedShe hovers just out of reach, peering warily into the dimness, her knuckles whitening around the basket handle. "Red pauses, her voice wavering, 'Grandmother, why are your hands so large?'" ——Red

Grandmother's hands twitch atop the blanket, their silhouette oddly misshapen in the gloom as she beckons Red even closer. "All the better to hold you with, my dear." ——Grandmother

Red leans in, her heart pounding, searching Grandmother's face for any sign of reassurance. "And Grandmother, why are your eyes so big and bright in this darkness?" ——Red

Grandmother's eyes glint oddly in the dim light as she fixes her gaze on Red, a thin smile curling at the edges of her mouth. "All the better to see you clearly, my sweet child." ——Grandmother

Red takes another cautious step back, her eyes darting to the shadowed outline beneath the quilt. "And Grandmother, why are your ears so pointed and sharp?" ——Red

Grandmother shifts restlessly beneath the covers, the sharp outline of her ears catching a sliver of dim light, making Red step back uncertainly. "All the better to hear every little sound you make, darling." ——Grandmother

Red takes an involuntary step back, clutching her basket to her chest as the figure in the bed grins hungrily, shadows shifting across its face. "Red's breath catches as she whispers, 'Grandmother, why are your teeth so long and sharp?'" ——Red

Grandmother's form shifts in the gloom, revealing a predatory smile as she lunges forward from the bed. "All the better to eat you with, my dear." ——Grandmother

Red, torn between her duty and her feelings, ultimately decides to face the unfolding danger with Lucien by her side.

Together, they approach the cottage, where Red’s suspicion deepens upon hearing Grandmother’s strange voice and strange behavior, leading into the classic confrontation with the disguised wolf.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 7: Red Confronts Lucien about Trust and Truth

Red stands near the cottage porch, gripping her basket tightly as Lucien lingers nearby, his coat brushed with dew and uncertainty in his eyes.

Confronting him directly, Red demands an explanation for his careful following and the secrets she senses in his manner.

Lucien, visibly affected, confesses his actions stem from loneliness and a desire to escape the emptiness of his own life, not from harmful intent.

Rather than offering physical proof, Lucien bares his vulnerability, expressing that being with Red makes him hope for belonging.

Red steps out from the shadows, her eyes narrowed and jaw set, blocking the narrow path and waiting for his answer, every muscle tense as she watches for any sign of a lie. "You’ve been behind me since sunset—don’t bother denying it. I want to know why. What is it you’re after, and what are you hiding? I can see it in the way you move, the things you don’t say. If you’re here for the same reasons I am, then say so. If not, you’d better start explaining before I decide you’re a threat." ——Red

Red, moved yet cautious, insists on hearing the full truth before granting trust, making clear that her continued acceptance depends on Lucien's honesty.

Lucien admits he has never known the comfort of family or a place to call home, and that his longing for connection is directed toward her.

Lucien lowers his gaze, his hands fidgeting restlessly in his lap. His voice trembles as he speaks, betraying the vulnerability he's trying to share. "I. I know how it must look, but I swear, I never meant any harm. It was the quiet—the emptiness—sometimes it feels so heavy, you know? I just thought maybe. maybe if I understood more, it wouldn't feel so lonely. I—I'm sorry if it seems wrong. I was just trying to find something, anything, that made the silence bearable." ——Lucien

The tension softens as Red acknowledges his confession with a nod, accepting a fragile truce while keeping her guard up.

Overhead, birds call and the distant sound of an axe hints at another presence nearby.

Red stands firm, her eyes unwavering on his, the silence between them charged with expectation and warning. "If you want me to believe you, to trust you, then I need the truth now. All of it. No more games, no more half-answers. What you say next decides everything." ——Red

# Chapter 8: Red Decides Her Own Path

Red stands at the cottage door, basket in hand, and knocks—her knuckles tapping against the weathered wood.

Lucien lingers nearby, shifting his weight on the gravel path, glancing toward Red with hesitant expectation.

Red turns, her cloak catching the breeze, and gestures for Lucien to step closer, her voice steady as she says, 'If you're to meet my grandmother, it will be properly, not by chance.

' Lucien nods, brushing mud from his boots and approaching the threshold, his posture respectful.

Lucien pauses at the threshold, lowering his gaze in a gesture of respect, his hands clasped lightly in front of him as he waits for permission to proceed. "I hope I'm not intruding. This place. It deserves reverence, and I wish to honor that. I've come seeking answers, but I will tread carefully." ——Lucien

Lucien lowers his gaze, hands loosely clasped before him, waiting for a sign of permission to proceed. "If I may, I seek only guidance, and I promise to disturb nothing that rests within these walls." ——Lucien

As Red opens the door and invites Lucien in, he pauses at the entrance, expressing his wish not to intrude and his intention to honor the space.

Red steps aside, holding the door open for Lucien, then walks into the kitchen and sets the basket down with a gentle thud, glancing at Lucien with a welcoming smile. "Come on in, Lucien. Make yourself at home." ——Red

Lucien steps cautiously into the kitchen, glancing at the basket with curious anticipation. "Thanks, Red—this place always smells like cinnamon and something warm." ——Lucien

Red glances at Lucien with a small, inviting smile and starts unpacking the basket. "It's just an apple pie this time—I thought it might sweeten up our little chat." ——Red

Red reassures him, inviting him to make himself at home, but sets clear boundaries, explaining that while the past is behind them, trust must be earned anew.

Red steps aside, holding the door open for Lucien, her posture both welcoming and firm. She gestures toward the kitchen table, inviting him to sit as the warmth of the cottage envelops them. "Lucien, come in. The past is behind us, and I believe in second chances, but things will be different now. My home is open to you, but my trust will be earned slowly. Let’s start again—formally, this time." ——Red

Lucien steps just inside the doorway, pausing with a slight bow, his gaze steady and sincere as he awaits her invitation further in. "Thank you, Red; I understand, and I’m grateful for this chance—my respect for your home and your boundaries will guide every step I take from here." ——Lucien

Lucien gratefully accepts the invitation, promising to respect Red's home and boundaries.

Together, they enter the warm, bread- and cinnamon-scented cottage for a formal introduction, signaling forgiveness and the careful establishment of new terms for their relationship.
