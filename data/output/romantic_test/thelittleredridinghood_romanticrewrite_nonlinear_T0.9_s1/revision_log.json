        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue introduces several major deviations from the original plot: Lucien reveals he is the Wolf's son, admits he was sent by a Council to protect Red, and exposes that Red is heir to a powerful bloodline. The original plot did not include these specific backstory elements—only that Lucien confesses his feelings and reveals Grandmother's manipulations. The updated plot now accommodates these new revelations, ensuring character motivations and narrative threads remain logically consistent.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shows Red's mother requesting a lamp to examine the letter together, which is more collaborative than the original plot’s depiction where Red immediately takes the letter herself. Red’s responses in the dialogue are more emotionally articulate and assertive than in the original summary, showing her explicitly rejecting her mother’s collaborative approach in favor of independent action. The updated plot now reflects this nuanced interaction, emphasizing the tension between Red’s independence and her mother’s protective instincts.",

        "plot_change_note": "In the dialogue, Lucien is much more direct about seeking something lost and challenges Red and Elias, escalating the confrontation. Red is assertive in rejecting Lucien's offer, and Elias is protective but lets Red take the lead in the final decision. The original plot had Lucien more subtly trying to mislead them, but in the dialogue, his intentions and desperation are more overt, and the emotional stakes are higher. The updated plot reflects this more confrontational, revealing interaction and clarifies Red's agency in deciding to stay on the path.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue introduces a critical new element: Red is allowed to open only one letter, and that choice is final—an ultimatum not present in the original plot, which had Red actively rejecting both letters by tearing one up and refusing to participate in matchmaking. Here, Red initially engages with the choice, asks about its consequences, and ultimately chooses Elias's letter before asserting her agency. The updated plot now incorporates the irreversible nature of the letter choice and Red's response to it, ensuring consistency with her motivations and the dialogue's events.",
