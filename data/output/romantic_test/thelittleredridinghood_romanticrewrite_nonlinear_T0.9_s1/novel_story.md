# Chapter 5: The Confrontation at the Cottage

Red and Elias arrive at the cottage, tension running high as Red hesitates at the threshold.

Elias stands protectively behind her, his ax ready.

When Red knocks, Lucien—posing as Grandmother—welcomes them in, his performance convincing at first.

The air is thick with suspicion as Lucien pours tea and offers it to Red, but she challenges him, refusing to drink until he does.

Lucien complies to ease her doubts, but the underlying distrust remains.

Elias, unsettled by signs of intrusion (muddy boots by the hearth), interrogates Lucien about them, suggesting that danger may already be inside.

Lucien WolfLucien pours the tea with careful grace, the porcelain cup clinking gently as he places it in front of Red. His eyes linger on her face, searching for a reaction, his demeanor gentle but watchful. "Please, Red, have some tea. You look weary—it will calm your nerves. I would not see you come to harm under my roof." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red hesitates, her fingers hovering over the delicate porcelain, eyes narrowed as she studies Lucien's face for any sign of deceit. "Thank you, Lucien, but I can't help but wonder—what exactly have you put in it?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien meets Red’s gaze steadily, his lips quirking in a half-smile as he pushes the cup a fraction closer across the table. "Only chamomile and honey, Red—nothing more sinister than comfort; unless you suspect I’d wish you ill for trusting me." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red wraps her hands around the cup but makes no move to drink, her eyes fixed on Lucien’s face, searching for the slightest twitch of guilt or malice. "Trust is earned, Lucien, not steeped; forgive me if I wait and watch you take the first sip." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien lifts the delicate cup to his lips, his eyes never leaving Red's, and sips slowly, the steam curling between them like a silent question. "Very well, Red—if it eases your mind, I shall drink first." ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien WolfLucien sips from his own cup, his gaze never leaving Red as steam curls between them, the space thick with unspoken challenge. "See? No harm done—now, will you trust me enough to join me, or shall we sit in silence with our doubts between us?" ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red keeps her hands folded in her lap, eyes fixed on Lucien's as she refuses the tea, her posture tense but unyielding. "Perhaps silence is safer, Lucien—sometimes what’s left unspoken is more telling than any shared cup." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

The conversation turns tense and personal as Lucien abandons his disguise, confessing his deep feelings for Red in a passionate outpouring.

Elias circles the room, his fingers trailing along the edge of the window frame. His eyes flick toward the muddy boots by the hearth, then linger on the half-drawn curtains, as if measuring the shadows that spill into the room. "No, thank you, Lucien. I can't seem to settle tonight." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien studies Elias intently, his eyes flickering from the boots to the restless pacing. "Is something troubling you, Elias, or is it the weather seeping in through those half-open curtains?" ——Lucien Wolf

Elias pauses by the muddy boots, his hand hovering above them as if expecting them to move of their own accord. "It's not the weather, Lucien—it's what we let in without noticing." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien gestures toward the hearth, his eyes narrowing as he studies Elias's restless pacing. "Those boots by the fire weren't there this afternoon, Elias—are you expecting someone, or did you bring something in with you?" ——Lucien Wolf

Elias pauses by the hearth, his hand hovering uncertainly above the boots, eyes flicking toward the shadowed corners of the room. "I found them outside, half-buried in the mire—someone left in a hurry, or hoped they wouldn't be found." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien steps closer to the hearth, his eyes narrowing as he studies Elias's restless pacing and the dark space beyond the curtains. "You seem more concerned about what lingers in the shadows than the mud on the floor, Elias—should I be worried for both our sakes?" ——Lucien Wolf

Elias pauses near the hearth, his eyes fixed on the boots as if expecting them to move of their own accord. "Perhaps you should, Lucien—there are things that cling to us long after we've brushed the mud away." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien steps closer to the fire, eyeing the boots and glancing at the restless flicker of Elias’s shadow on the wall. "Tell me, Elias, are we hiding from what’s outside—or from what’s already found its way in?" ——Lucien Wolf

Red is shocked by this revelation, torn between the two men and the secrets swirling around her.

Lucien WolfLucien’s hands tremble as he pulls off the shawl, his voice raw with emotion. He stands before Red, unmasked, vulnerability etched in every line of his face. "Red, wait—please. Before you go, there’s something I can’t hide any longer. I—" ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red freezes mid-step, eyes wide as Lucien pulls off the shawl, her fingers clutching her basket in stunned disbelief. "Lucien—your face, I—what are you doing?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's hands tremble as the shawl slips from his shoulders, his eyes searching Red's face for hope or forgiveness. "I can't pretend anymore—it's you, Red, it's always been you, and I couldn't bear another day hiding what I feel." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red takes a step back, heart pounding, her basket nearly slipping from her grasp as she tries to process the truth in Lucien's eyes. "Lucien, I—why didn't you tell me before?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's hands tremble as he clutches the shawl, his eyes searching Red's face for any sign of hope or forgiveness. "Because every time I tried, the fear of losing you was stronger than the hope you'd feel the same." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red’s voice trembles as she steps closer, searching Lucien’s eyes for the truth, her heart pounding with confusion and something like hope. "Lucien, you’ve been right beside me all this time—and I never saw it, not really." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's hands tremble as he lets the shawl fall completely, his eyes searching Red's for any sign of hope or rejection. "Red, I would rather stand before you bare and risk everything than spend another moment in the shadows of my own heart." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps back, her hands trembling, eyes locked on Lucien's unveiled face, torn between shock and a dawning warmth. "Lucien, my heart is pounding—I never imagined you felt this way, but now that I see you, truly see you, I don't know if I can ever look at you the same again." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien steps closer, his eyes searching Red’s face for hope, vulnerability laid bare in the trembling of his hands. "Red, I need you to see me, all of me—because every part of me has loved you, even the ones I tried to hide." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps closer, her gaze searching Lucien's face, her breath unsteady as she reaches for his trembling hand. "Lucien, I—I see you now, and it's terrifying and wonderful all at once." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien then reveals that he was never at the cottage by accident: he was sent by a mysterious Council to protect Red from a greater threat—the Wolf—and that Lucien himself is the Wolf's son.

Lucien WolfLucien steps out from the shadows, gaze locked on Red, voice low and charged with urgency. He glances at Elias, the challenge clear, then fixes his eyes on Red, awaiting her answer. "Red, you think you know your grandmother, but I've seen what she hides from you. The secret buried beneath her floorboards—the one you never dared to ask about. I know the truth, and I can share it with you. But only if you choose me, Red. You must decide: trust me and learn everything, or stay with Elias and keep living in the dark." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances anxiously between Lucien and Elias, her fists clenched at her sides, heart pounding with fear and longing for answers. "Red (voice trembling): Lucien, if you truly know what she’s hiding, why force me to choose—why not just help me?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias meets Lucien’s eyes, protective, while Red glances between them, torn and uncertain. "Elias (stepping between them, voice firm): Because, Red, Lucien doesn’t offer truth—he offers control; I’d never make you choose between love and answers." ——Elias

Lucien WolfRed squeezes Elias’s hand, torn between the hunger for truth and loyalty, while Elias’s jaw tightens, bracing for her decision. "Lucien (leaning in, eyes glinting): But answers come at a price, Red—choose me, and you’ll finally understand what your grandmother feared most." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clasps her cloak tightly, torn between Lucien's tempting offer and Elias's unwavering support, her breath shallow as the weight of the decision threatens to overwhelm her. "Red (voice breaking, looking between them): I can't—how am I supposed to choose when the truth might destroy everything I love?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias gently takes Red’s hand, standing protectively at her side, while Lucien’s smile sharpens, eyes daring Red to break away. "Elias (softly, but with resolve): Red, whatever the truth is, we’ll face it together—don’t let him turn your fear into his weapon." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien steps closer, casting a long shadow between Red and Elias, the tension tightening like a drawn bowstring. "Lucien (voice low, almost tender): Or perhaps, Red, you’re afraid that the truth will force you to see Elias—and yourself—for who you really are." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red’s hands tremble at her sides, her gaze flickering desperately between Lucien’s unyielding stare and Elias’s steady, pleading eyes. "Red (voice barely above a whisper): If I choose you, Lucien, and the truth is as dark as you promise—will I ever be able to go back?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien holds out his hand, his gaze never leaving Red's, while Elias clenches his fists at her side, silent but unwavering. "Lucien (smiling, voice like velvet): Once secrets are unearthed, Red, there is no returning—only living with what you now know." ——Lucien Wolf

Elias gently reaches for Red’s hand, holding it steady as Lucien watches, silent and expectant. "Elias (meeting Red’s eyes, voice unwavering): If you leap into darkness with him, Red, remember who offered you the light to find your way back." ——Elias

He declares Red is the last heir to a bloodline capable of ending the Wolf, and that Grandmother orchestrated the entire situation, manipulating every choice and danger they've faced.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red’s hands tremble as she shoves the teacup across the table, her eyes wide with fear and anger. She stands abruptly, heart racing, glaring at Lucien, demanding answers. "Lucien, stop—just stop! I know something's wrong. Don't lie to me. What are you really doing here? Why have you been following me?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien sets his own teacup down with trembling hands, his eyes meeting Red's, conflicted but resolute. "Red, please—it's not what you think, but you deserve the truth." ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien WolfRed's hands tremble as she grips the edge of the table, her eyes blazing with hurt and suspicion. "Then tell me—right now—why should I trust a single word you say?" ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien WolfLucien leans in, voice low and urgent, his eyes flickering with conflicted emotion. "Red, I never wanted to hurt you, but if you really want the truth—I'm not here by accident; I was sent to watch over you, and there's more danger than you know." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red's hands tremble as she shoves the teacup further away, eyes blazing with accusation and fear. "Sent to watch over me? By who, Lucien? And what danger—what aren't you telling me?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfShe shoves the teacup aside, the porcelain clattering, her eyes burning with betrayal and fear. "Red's hand trembles as she glares at Lucien, voice sharp: 'Enough riddles—tell me everything, now, or I swear I'll never trust you again.'" ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien WolfLucien lowers his gaze, voice low and urgent, as he pushes the teacup aside to meet Red's eyes directly, the weight of his confession heavy between them. "Red, the Council sent me because they're afraid—the Wolf is hunting you, and I'm the only one who can keep you alive." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red stands up abruptly, her chair scraping against the floor, fists clenched at her sides as she glares at Lucien, demanding an answer. "You expect me to believe that after all your lies—what exactly is the Council so afraid of, Lucien, and why am I the target?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien leans forward, his eyes pleading, as Red recoils further, her knuckles white against the table. "Because, Red, you’re not just a girl in the woods—you’re the last heir to the bloodline the Wolf fears most." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red leans forward, eyes blazing with urgency, her voice trembling between anger and fear as she grips the edge of the table. "Heir to what, Lucien? Stop hiding behind secrets—if you want me to trust you, tell me what the Wolf really wants and why my life is worth risking yours." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien leans forward, voice low and urgent, eyes pleading for Red to believe him as thunder rumbles outside the cottage. "Red, the Wolf hunts the blood that can end him—and you carry the legacy to destroy everything he’s built." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red's eyes fill with hurt and fury as she pushes her chair back, fists clenched on the table. "So all this time, you've been lying to me—watching me like I'm some weapon, not a person?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien’s voice breaks with guilt as he meets Red’s eyes, his hands clenched tight on the table, bracing for her response. "Red, I never wanted you to feel like a pawn—every choice I made was to protect you from a threat you couldn't see." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shoves her chair back, her eyes blazing as she stands, fists clenched and voice trembling with hurt and anger. "Protect me? Lucien, you call this protection—lying, hiding the truth, making me feel like I'm just a piece in your game?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien’s voice cracks as he leans forward, eyes pleading, hands open on the table in surrender. "Red, I swear—you were never a game to me, but if you want the whole truth, I’ll give it, even if it means you hate me." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red leans in, her voice trembling with anger and fear, fists clenched on the table as she fixes Lucien with an unwavering, desperate stare. "Then prove it, Lucien—look me in the eyes and tell me everything, no more riddles, no more half-truths—I want the real reason you’re here, right now." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien’s voice shakes as he meets Red’s gaze, bracing himself for her reaction, hands clenched tight on the table. "Red, the truth is—I was sent to protect you because I am the Wolf’s son, and if anyone finds out, both our lives are forfeit." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red's voice cracks as her eyes widen in disbelief, her hands clenched tight around the edge of the table, knuckles white. "You—you’re his son? All this time, you’ve been hiding that from me?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's voice trembles as he meets Red's gaze, his hands curling into fists on the table, bracing for her reaction. "Yes, Red—I am, and every day I’ve fought between the blood in my veins and the promise I made to keep you safe." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red’s voice cracks as she backs away, eyes wide and brimming with hurt, fists clenched at her sides. "So everything—the Council, the danger, your secrets—was because you’re torn between me and him?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien’s voice cracks as he finally meets her eyes, guilt and desperation raw on his face. "Yes, Red—every moment with you has been a battle between the loyalty I was born into and the loyalty I chose." ——Lucien Wolf

Red reels from these revelations, feeling betrayed by Lucien's secrecy and Grandmother's machinations.

Lucien WolfLucien's voice cracks as he lowers his eyes, shoulders hunched. The firelight flickers across his pale face, and the room hangs in stunned silence. Red's mouth falls open in disbelief, her hands clenching tight in her lap. Elias stares into the flames, jaw working wordlessly as the distant caw of crows echoes, the weight of betrayal settling around them like a shroud. "It was never just the woods, or the wolves. Grandmother—she planned it all. Every path we followed, every warning she whispered—it was her hand guiding us, watching us. I didn't want to believe it, but the signs were there. I'm so sorry. We were never in control." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red's voice breaks as she steps back, her eyes wide with disbelief, fists clenching at her sides while Elias stares into the fire, jaw set and silent. "No—no, that can't be true. Grandmother wouldn't—she couldn't have lied to us, not like this." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias stares into the fire, his hands clenched tight, searching Red's face for answers neither of them have. "But if she shaped every danger and every choice, then who are we to her—pawns, or family?" ——Elias

Elias supports Red, vowing to help her face the truth together.

The chapter ends with Red and Elias confronting the enormity of the secrets revealed, questioning their roles as pawns or family, as the crackle of the hearth and distant caws of crows echo the uncertainty ahead.

# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Letter

Red slices rye bread as her mother discovers a wax-sealed letter on the doorstep, its pine-resin scent raising suspicion.

Her mother, anxious, asks Red to fetch the lamp so they can examine the letter together.

Red, however, asserts her determination to read the letter herself, emphasizing her need to face whatever truths or warnings it contains.

Red's MotherShe holds the parchment away from her face, eyes narrowing as she turns it over in her hands, the lines of suspicion deepening around her mouth. "Pine resin, at this time of year? That’s no accident. And who sends a letter after dusk, when all decent folk have shut their doors? It’s never good news, not when it smells like the old woods. Red, fetch me the lamp—let’s see what they want this time." ——Red's Mother

Despite her mother’s pleas to be cautious and reminders of past troubles, Red insists on uncovering the truth, expressing compassion for her mother’s fears but refusing to let them hold her back.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red takes a careful breath, breaks the wax seal with deliberate precision, and smooths the letter open on her lap, her eyes scanning the first lines with a mix of apprehension and quiet strength. "Thank you, but I need to do this myself. Whatever these words hold—answers, warnings, or memories—I have to be the one to face them. My hands may tremble, but my heart is certain." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red inhales deeply, her fingers lingering for a moment on the cracked wax seal before she unfolds the letter, her gaze unwavering despite the flicker of nerves in her eyes. "No matter what these pages reveal, I need to know the truth with my own eyes." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red draws a slow breath, steadying her nerves as she unfolds the letter, her eyes scanning the first line. "I owe it to myself—and to everyone waiting for answers—to read every word, no matter how heavy they might be." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red’s mother warns of the dangers of family secrets, but Red, resolute, states that hiding from them would only make things worse.

Red's MotherHer mother tightens her grip on Red’s wrist, her fingers trembling with the memory of the last letter’s consequences. Her eyes search Red’s face, desperate to protect her from the shadows of their family’s past. "Red, wait—please. Remember the last letter, how it tore through our lives? I can’t let you walk into danger again, not after what happened. Grandmother’s warnings aren’t just words on paper, they’re a shield. Promise me you’ll think twice before opening that envelope." ——Red's Mother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red gently frees her wrist, her eyes steady and searching her mother's face for reassurance as she reaches for the envelope. "I know you're scared, Mama, but I have to understand what Grandmother meant—secrets left in shadows only grow darker." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red's MotherHer mother’s grip tightens, voice trembling as she searches Red’s eyes for hesitation, old fear flickering beneath her worry. "Secrets can swallow a family whole, Red—don’t let your curiosity blind you to the pain we barely survived last time." ——Red's Mother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red gently frees her wrist from her mother’s grasp, her eyes steady with resolve even as her mother’s hand trembles in the air between them. "I hear your fear, Mama, but I can’t let it chain me to silence when the truth is calling—I need to know what Grandmother was so afraid of." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

With trembling hands but a steady heart, Red opens the letter, determined to discover Grandmother’s cryptic message, while her mother remains anxious but unable to dissuade her.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Wolf's Interception and Deception

Red and Elias move carefully along the forest path toward Grandmother’s cottage, with Red alert for any sign of danger.

As they cross the mossy bridge, Lucien Wolf appears, emerging from the shadows in a mud-spattered cloak.

He introduces himself as a lost traveler, but Red immediately challenges his intentions, pressing him to reveal his true purpose in the woods.

Lucien admits he seeks something that was taken from him and hints at the woods’ hidden secrets, suggesting his motives are more personal and urgent than he first claimed.

Lucien WolfLucien blocks their path with a graceful, deliberate bow, his eyes shining with polite curiosity as he measures their reaction. "Pardon my intrusion—permit me but a moment of your time. I am a traveler, rather shamefully astray in these parts, and it appears my sense of direction has failed me yet again. Might I trouble you for some guidance toward the nearest crossroads, or perhaps an inn? The roads here are unfamiliar, and I would rather not wander where I am not welcome." ——Lucien Wolf

Tension escalates as Elias steps protectively between Red and Lucien, warning him to stay back.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red angles her body between Lucien and Elias, basket clutched tight to her chest. Her eyes narrow, flickering from Lucien’s unreadable gaze to Elias’ white-knuckled grip on his axe. "Lucien, you keep saying you mean no harm, but you won’t tell us what you’re really doing in these woods. If you want us to trust you, you’d better start talking—now." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's gaze flickers between Red and Elias, a faint, unsettling smile playing at his lips as Elias plants his feet, body tense and ready to spring. "Perhaps I wander because these woods hold secrets not meant to be kept—secrets I need, whether you trust me or not." ——Lucien Wolf

Elias steps forward, placing himself slightly between Red and Lucien, knuckles white on his axe as his eyes lock onto Lucien's every move. "Red, just say the word and I'll make sure he doesn't get any closer." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps in front of Elias, blocking Lucien's path, her eyes narrowed with warning. "Stay back, Lucien—I've seen what happens to those who chase secrets in these woods, and I won't let you drag us into it." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's gaze sharpens, voice lowering as he steps just close enough for tension to crackle between them, while Elias plants his feet, knuckles white on his axe. "You mistake caution for malice, Red—I'm searching for what was taken from me, nothing more, but if you stand in my way, I can't promise you'll remain uninvolved." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts in front of Elias, chin lifted defiantly, her gaze locked on Lucien as Elias's axe glints in the fading light. "If what was taken belongs to the darkness in these woods, then maybe it's better you never find it." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfElias positions himself protectively in front of Red, eyes locked on Lucien, muscles tensed for a fight. "Elias steps forward, axe raised between them, voice low and steady: 'If your search threatens Red, you'll answer to me first.'" ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien WolfHe takes a measured step back, hands open but tension crackling in the air like a storm about to break. "Lucien's eyes narrow, a flicker of something feral in his gaze as he replies, 'Then let us hope, Elias, that your loyalty is not misplaced, for not all monsters wear claws.'" ——Lucien Wolf

Lucien, unfazed, shares a story of once being lost in the woods and proposes a shortcut through the undergrowth, claiming it might reveal important truths.

Lucien WolfLucien lets his gaze linger on Red, a faint, knowing smile tugging at the corner of his mouth. His gesture toward the undergrowth is casual, yet deliberate, his eyes glinting with a mix of invitation and challenge. "You know, once—years ago—I lost my way in these woods. The forest has a habit of swallowing up those who aren't careful, masking the familiar with shadows and whispers. I wandered for hours, but then I found a path almost hidden by brambles, a shortcut, if you will. It saved me. or perhaps, it changed me. If we slip through here—just beyond that thicket—we can reach our destination much faster. Of course, the main road is safe, but sometimes the safest path isn't the most enlightening, wouldn't you agree, Red?" ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tilts her head, eyes narrowing thoughtfully on the tangled undergrowth Lucien gestures toward, her hand tightening ever so slightly around the basket she carries. "Enlightening, perhaps—but sometimes the shadows teach harsher lessons than the light ever could." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias steps slightly in front of Red, eyes narrowed at Lucien, his tone edged with warning as he glances toward the tangled undergrowth. "Or sometimes the shadows swallow those who trust them too easily—I'd rather we stick to what we can see, unless you've got a reason for us to risk it, Lucien." ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien's eyes glint as he gestures subtly toward the tangled shortcut, his voice low and inviting, while his gaze flickers between Red and Elias, gauging their resolve. "Ah, but isn't it in the unknown—where roots twist and secrets lie—that true stories are found, Red?" ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances toward the tangled undergrowth, her fingers tightening around her basket as she studies Lucien's shadowed expression. "Maybe so, Lucien, but stories found in the dark often come with teeth—what is it you hope we discover off the path?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Lucien WolfLucien's lips curl into a sly smile as his eyes glint, glancing between Red and the shadowed thicket, inviting yet unreadable. "Why, only what the forest wishes to reveal, Red—sometimes treasures, sometimes truths best left sleeping." ——Lucien Wolf

Elias narrows his eyes, stepping slightly in front of Red, his posture guarded and voice edged with challenge. "If your shortcut is so enlightening, Lucien, why do you hesitate to walk it alone?" ——Elias

Lucien WolfLucien's smile sharpens as he glances between Red and Elias, his hand gesturing invitingly toward the shadowed thicket, eyes glinting with unspoken challenge. "Ah, Elias, company lends courage—and, perhaps, ensures the tales we bring back are not just my own." ——Lucien Wolf

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances at the tangled undergrowth, her fingers tightening around her basket as she studies Lucien's expression for any flicker of intent. "Some tales aren't meant to be faced alone, Lucien—especially when the forest seems to hold its breath as we choose our way." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red and Elias refuse the offer, debating the risks of venturing off the safe path.

Elias stands his ground, folding his arms and blocking the way forward, his voice steady but resolute. "I'm not going any farther off the path, Red. We don't know what's waiting beyond those trees, and I won't risk it just because you think there's a shortcut." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps firmly in front of Elias, blocking his way and guiding him back toward the path. "The shortcut isn't worth the danger, Elias—I need you to trust me and stay on the marked trail, now." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red firmly chooses the marked trail, asserting her agency and asking Elias to trust her judgment.

Lucien, denied, watches them with narrowed eyes, his motives and past with the woods left ambiguous as he disappears into the shadows, the air thick with secrets and unspoken threats.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Grandmother’s Disappearance

Red approaches the cottage door, gripping her basket tightly.

She brushes aside a hanging sprig of rosemary as she knocks twice, the hollow sound echoing inside.

Elias paces a short distance behind her, scanning the shadowed tree line, his axe resting on his shoulder.

When no answer comes, Red pushes the door open;

it creaks, revealing an unlit interior.

She steps inside, running her fingers over the cold hearthstones, noting the untouched teacup and the absence of Grandmother's shawl.

Elias follows, sniffing the air for unfamiliar scents, then inspects muddy footprints near the back window.

Red quietly calls for her grandmother, her voice low and deliberate, while Elias checks the pantry for signs of recent use.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red stands just inside the doorway, her hand resting on the frame as she peers into the dimly lit room. Her voice trembles slightly, betraying her unease, as she scans the shadows for any sign of her grandmother. "Grandmother? It's me, Red. Are you here?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias runs his finger along the dusty shelf, frowning as he glances back toward Red. "No fresh crumbs, and the flour tin's barely touched—it's like nobody's baked here in days." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red edges closer to the bedroom door, her hand trembling as she rests it on the old brass knob, her eyes darting to Elias for reassurance. "Grandmother, can you hear me? Please answer, it's so quiet in here." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias kneels to inspect a set of faint footprints in the flour on the floor, his brow furrowed with worry. "Red, the bread’s stale and there’s dust on the shelves—if your grandmother’s been here, she hasn’t eaten in a while." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket tighter, glancing nervously at the shadowy hallway beyond the kitchen. "It's not like her to stay so silent—she always greets me before I even reach the door." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias runs his fingers along the pantry doorframe, frowning as he studies a faint, unfamiliar footprint in the dust. "Maybe she's resting, but something feels wrong—the air's heavy, like someone's been hiding here." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red steps forward, her hand trembling as she clutches her basket, eyes scanning the dim corners of the room. "Grandmother, if you're here, please say something—I'm starting to get scared." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias crouches beside the print, tracing its outline with a tense finger as he glances back at Red. "Red, look—there’s a muddy footprint by the back door, too large to be hers." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red edges closer to Elias, her voice trembling, as she glances anxiously toward the shadowy corners of the room. "Then who could it belong to, Elias?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias lowers his voice, motioning for Red to stay behind him as he steps cautiously toward the hallway. "I don't know, but we need to be careful—someone else might be inside." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red edges closer to the bedroom door, her hand trembling as she reaches for the handle, while Elias scans the shadows behind her, tense and alert. "Grandmother, if you're in trouble, make a sound—anything—so we know you're safe." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias quietly steps toward the dim hallway, his hand hovering near the old lantern as he listens for any movement. "Red, stay close—I’ll check the bedroom, but keep your eyes open for anything out of place." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket tighter, her gaze darting anxiously around the dimly lit room. "Elias, the sheets are rumpled, but there's no sign of her—it's like she vanished." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

EliasRed edges toward the window, her hand trembling as she reaches for the piece of fabric. "Elias, the window's open just a crack—and I think I see a scrap of her shawl caught on the latch." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches the scrap of shawl, her hands trembling, and peers anxiously out the window into the shadowy yard. "Her shawl—she wouldn't leave it behind unless she left in a hurry; Elias, what if she's trying to signal us?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

EliasRed clutches the edge of the shawl, her voice trembling as she scans the shadows of the room. "Elias, what if she’s hiding somewhere close, waiting for us to find her?" ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red kneels beside the bed, her hands trembling as she lifts the quilt, searching for another sign of her grandmother. "I'll check under the bed—maybe she dropped something else, something to help us find her." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

EliasRed kneels beside the bed, holding up the button with trembling fingers, her eyes searching Elias's face for reassurance. "Elias, there's a button here on the floor—it's from her cardigan, I'm sure of it." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches the button tightly in her fist, her eyes darting nervously around the shadowy corners of the room. "Elias, the room feels colder all of a sudden—do you think someone else is still here, watching us?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias steps protectively in front of Red, his hand tightening around the handle of a nearby fire iron as he listens intently toward the hallway. "Elias: Stay behind me, Red—I hear a floorboard creaking in the hallway, and we're not alone." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red clutches her basket closer, her eyes wide as she strains to hear any movement beyond the door. "Elias, my heart's pounding—should we call out again, or stay quiet and listen?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Their coordinated search reveals no sign of Grandmother, only a faint musky odor lingering near her bed.

Red exchanges a wary glance with Elias, both now alert to the peculiar silence and the sense of intrusion.

# Chapter 2: Red Encounters the Woodsman

Red steps carefully along the muddy path, her basket swinging from one arm as she scans the undergrowth for movement.

She pauses at the sound of chopping wood and sees Elias, the woodsman, splitting logs with steady precision, his boots sunk into the soft earth.

Intent on reaching her grandmother’s cottage, Red approaches and greets him with cautious politeness.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red pauses a few paces away, her grip tightening on her basket as she glances at the gleaming edge of Elias's axe, keeping her tone pleasant but her stance ready to move. "Good afternoon, sir. I didn't expect to meet anyone on the path—are you heading into the woods as well?" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias leans the axe casually against his shoulder, offering a guarded smile while watching Red's reaction closely. "Afternoon, miss—these woods aren't always safe for wandering alone; this axe is just for my work, but it can be comforting to keep close." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red shifts her basket from one arm to the other, subtly stepping back to keep a careful distance from Elias and his axe. "I see, well, I suppose it's wise to be prepared out here—I'm just passing through to visit my grandmother." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias rests the axe on his shoulder, offering a measured, almost reassuring smile, yet his steady gaze remains fixed on Red, gauging her reaction. "If you’d like, I can walk you part of the way—just to make sure nothing troublesome crosses your path." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red offers a polite smile, but her grip tightens subtly on her basket as her gaze lingers on the gleaming edge of the axe. "Thank you, that's thoughtful of you, but I wouldn't want to trouble you or delay your work." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias straightens, wipes the sweat from his brow, and expresses concern for Red’s safety, mentioning rumors of wolves nearby.

Elias straightens up, wipes the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, and glances warily at the thickening shadows between the trees before turning his concerned gaze back to Red. "You know, Red, it's not safe to be alone out here—I've heard talk in the village of wolves wandering these woods lately. If you don't mind, I'd feel better if I walked with you a while." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red glances nervously over her shoulder, clutching her basket a little tighter as a chill wind rustles the leaves. "Thank you, Elias—honestly, I did hear something strange in the trees just now." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Elias scans the shadowy undergrowth, his hand hovering near the sturdy walking stick at his side. "Let's keep our voices low and stay close; if there really are wolves, we don't want to draw attention." ——Elias

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red adjusts her cloak, glancing warily between the gnarled trunks as she matches Elias's cautious pace. "All right, Elias—I'll stay close, but let me keep an eye out; sometimes the shadows play tricks, but I'd rather be safe than sorry." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red initially hesitates, not wanting to trouble him or delay his work, but admits to hearing something strange in the trees.

Elias insists on accompanying her, reassuring Red with his practical advice and protective presence.

Elias gestures to a narrow trail veering away from tangled underbrush, his hand steady and his gaze scanning ahead for any sign of danger. "Watch your step here, Red. The ground dips just past that fern—roots can catch your ankle if you're not careful. Stay close; I've walked these woods enough to know where the trouble hides." ——Elias

As they set off together, Elias points out safe trails and warns her of hidden roots, his voice low and practical.

The mist thickens as they walk, the forest closing in, and Red remains alert, her wariness gradually softening as Elias gently steadies her when she stumbles on a mossy stone.

Their footsteps blend with the rhythm of the woods, the path ahead opening just enough to promise safety if they move together.

# Chapter 6: Red’s Choice and Grandmother’s Return

Red enters the cottage, her boots damp with forest dew, carrying a basket of wildflowers.

She finds Grandmother mending a crimson cloak by the hearth.

Grandmother presents her with two sealed letters—one from Elias, one from Lucien Wolf—and tells Red she may open only one, warning her that the unopened letter will remain a silence she must carry.

Grandmother places the two sealed envelopes on the table, her eyes glinting with both challenge and concern. She pushes them forward, her hands steady but her voice laced with gravity, waiting for Red's response. "Red, my dear, before you lies a fork in your path—two letters from two souls who matter deeply. One is from Elias, the other from Lucien Wolf. Each carries a truth, a promise, perhaps even a secret. But you may open only one. Choose wisely, for the words within will shape what comes next." ——Grandmother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red draws a shaky breath, closes her eyes for a heartbeat, and finally reaches for Lucien Wolf's letter, her hand settling on the envelope as if it might burn. "Red's fingers tremble as she hovers between the envelopes, her eyes flickering from Grandmother's unreadable face to the names inked on each letter, feeling the weight of love, loyalty, and danger pressing in on her decision." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red (Red Riding Hood)Her hand hovers over the letter bearing Lucien's name, while her other hand clutches the edge of the table, knuckles white with tension. "Red swallows hard, her voice barely above a whisper as she asks, 'Grandmother, if I choose Elias, am I forsaking Lucien forever—or is there still a way back from the letter I leave unopened?'" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

GrandmotherShe folds her hands atop the table, watching Red's face for any flicker of resolve or regret. "Grandmother's eyes soften, but her tone remains grave: 'Once the seal is broken, Red, the path you walk will close behind you; the letter unopened becomes a silence you must carry.'" ——Grandmother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Her fingers brush the envelope, committing to the choice as her heart thunders in her chest. "Red inhales shakily, her gaze lingering on Lucien's name before she slowly reaches for Elias's letter, whispering, 'Then let truth be spoken, even if it means leaving some shadows unlit.'" ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Red hesitates, torn by the gravity of the choice.

She asks if choosing one means forsaking the other forever, and Grandmother confirms that the path she chooses is final.

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red tears a letter in half and lets the pieces fall into the glowing embers, watching them curl and blacken. "Grandmother, I know you mean well, but my life is not a puzzle to be solved with suitors and letters. I will choose my own way, in my own time, and no one else will decide for me." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

Grandmother folds her hands tightly in her lap, her gaze steady but shadowed with worry. "Child, stubbornness runs in our blood, but remember—the world is less forgiving of young women who stray from its plans." ——Grandmother

Red (Red Riding Hood)Red meets Grandmother's gaze steadily, her hands clenched with resolve at her sides. "Then let the world be less forgiving, Grandmother—I would rather face its storms on my own terms than live quietly in a cage built by others." ——Red (Red Riding Hood)

After a moment of internal struggle, Red chooses Elias’s letter, accepting the consequences, but then asserts her independence: she declares she will not let letters or matchmaking schemes define her fate, and vows to forge her own path, regardless of the world’s expectations.

Grandmother acknowledges Red’s resolve with a mixture of concern and respect, marking a shift in their relationship toward mutual understanding.
