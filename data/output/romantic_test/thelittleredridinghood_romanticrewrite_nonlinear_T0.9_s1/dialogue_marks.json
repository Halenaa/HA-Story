        "sentence": "Red pauses at the cottage door, her hand tightening around the brass handle as she exchanges a wary glance with Elias, who stands close behind, gripping his ax with calloused fingers. Red knocks twice, the wood echoing. The door creaks open to reveal 'Grandmother'—Lucien draped in faded shawls, his sharp eyes barely concealed behind spectacles. He ushers them inside, his movements fluid but strangely rehearsed. Red steps over the threshold, scanning the dim kitchen: the scent of pine needles and something metallic lingers. Lucien pours tea, his hands steady as he sets the cup before Red, urging her to drink. Elias declines, instead circling the room, his gaze lingering on the half-drawn curtains and muddy boots by the hearth. Lucien, voice low and urgent, confesses his affection for Red, his words tumbling out as he drops the disguise—removing the shawl and revealing his true face. He claims knowledge of Grandmother's secret, challenging Red to choose between him and Elias. Red, startled, pushes the teacup away, demanding the truth. The scene ends as Lucien, voice trembling, reveals that Grandmother orchestrated everything, leaving Red and Elias stunned amid the quiet crackle of the fire and the distant caw of crows outside.",
