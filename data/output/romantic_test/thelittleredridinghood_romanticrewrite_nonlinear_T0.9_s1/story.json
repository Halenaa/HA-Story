        "scene": "Late afternoon, at the edge of a mossy clearing deep in the forest. Sunlight slants through tangled branches, dappling the ground with gold. The air is cool and carries the scent of wet earth and woodsmoke. A small, weathered cottage sits beneath leaning pines; smoke curls from the crooked chimney, and the faint sound of a kettle hissing can be heard through a cracked window.",

Red knocks twice, the wood echoing. The door creaks open to reveal 'Grandmother'—Lucien draped in faded shawls, his sharp eyes barely concealed behind spectacles. He ushers them inside, his movements fluid but strangely rehearsed. Red steps over the threshold, scanning the dim kitchen: the scent of pine needles and something metallic lingers. Lucien pours tea, his hands steady as he sets the cup before Red, urging her to drink. Elias declines, instead circling the room, his gaze lingering on the half-drawn curtains and muddy boots by the hearth. Lucien, voice low and urgent, confesses his affection for Red, his words tumbling out as he drops the disguise—removing the shawl and revealing his true face. He claims knowledge of Grandmother's secret, challenging Red to choose between him and Elias. Red, startled, pushes the teacup away, demanding the truth. The scene ends as Lucien, voice trembling, reveals that Grandmother orchestrated everything, leaving Red and Elias stunned amid the quiet crackle of the fire and the distant caw of crows outside.",

Her mother, brow furrowed, unfolds a creased, wax-sealed letter left on the doorstep, the seal pressed with Grandmother’s familiar sigil. Setting down the knife, Red leans forward, watching as her mother sniffs the parchment, muttering about the odd pine-resin scent and the unexpected timing. Red, voice low but steady, insists on reading the letter herself, her resolve clear as she carefully breaks the wax and smooths out the paper. Her mother grips Red’s wrist, urging caution and reminding her of the last time a letter brought trouble, but Red gently pulls away, determined to uncover the message and the secrets behind Grandmother’s warning. The letter, filled with cryptic instructions and a veiled invitation, sets Red on edge; she pockets it, deciding to visit Grandmother herself, while her mother busies herself by sweeping breadcrumbs into the hearth, her movements brisk and anxious.",

Elias walks a pace behind, axe slung over his shoulder, eyes alert for movement among the bracken. As they round the mossy bridge, a stranger in a dark, mud-spattered cloak emerges from the shadows—Lucien Wolf. He blocks their way with a low bow, voice smooth but unfamiliar, introducing himself as a traveler seeking directions. Red tightens her grip on the basket, questioning Lucien about his purpose, while Elias shifts closer, hands tightening on his axe handle. Lucien offers a story about being lost, his gaze lingering on Red, and subtly attempts to divert them from the main path by pointing out a ‘shortcut’ through the undergrowth. Elias refuses, leading Red firmly back to the marked trail. Lucien watches, eyes narrowed, before vanishing into the trees, leaving the scent of damp earth and crushed ferns behind.",

Elias paces a short distance behind her, scanning the shadowed tree line, his axe resting on his shoulder. When no answer comes, Red pushes the door open; it creaks, revealing an unlit interior. She steps inside, running her fingers over the cold hearthstones, noting the untouched teacup and the absence of Grandmother's shawl. Elias follows, sniffing the air for unfamiliar scents, then inspects muddy footprints near the back window. Red quietly calls for her grandmother, her voice low and deliberate, while Elias checks the pantry for signs of recent use. Their coordinated search reveals no sign of Grandmother, only a faint musky odor lingering near her bed. Red exchanges a wary glance with Elias, both now alert to the peculiar silence and the sense of intrusion.",

She pauses at the sound of chopping wood and sees Elias, the woodsman, splitting logs with steady precision, his boots sunk into the soft earth. Intent on reaching her grandmother’s cottage, Red approaches and greets him with cautious politeness, her eyes flicking to the sharp axe in his hands. Elias straightens, wipes the sweat from his brow, and offers to walk with her through the forest, citing rumors of wolves nearby. Red hesitates, then nods, accepting his company. As they set off together, Elias points out safe trails and warns her of hidden roots, his voice low and practical. The mist thickens as they walk, the forest closing in, and Red glances sidelong at Elias, her wariness softening as he gently steadies her when she stumbles on a mossy stone. Their footsteps blend with the rhythm of the woods, the path ahead opening just enough to promise safety if they move together.",

Red inhales the scent of smoke and lavender, fingers the rough parchment, and stands to open the shutters wider, letting in the forest breeze. She declares, with measured voice, that she will decide her future herself, refusing to be cornered by matchmaking schemes, and tears one letter in half, dropping it into the embers. Grandmother nods slowly, her eyes glinting with approval as she sets aside her needlework, signaling a shift in their relationship.",
