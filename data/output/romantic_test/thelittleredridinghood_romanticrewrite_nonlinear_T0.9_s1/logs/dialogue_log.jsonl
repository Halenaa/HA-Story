Elias stands protectively behind her, his ax ready. When Red knocks, Lucien—posing as Grandmother—welcomes them in, his performance convincing at first. The air is thick with suspicion as Lucien pours tea and offers it to Red, but she challenges him, refusing to drink until he does. Lucien complies to ease her doubts, but the underlying distrust remains. Elias, unsettled by signs of intrusion (muddy boots by the hearth), interrogates Lucien about them, suggesting that danger may already be inside. The conversation turns tense and personal as Lucien abandons his disguise, confessing his deep feelings for Red in a passionate outpouring. Red is shocked by this revelation, torn between the two men and the secrets swirling around her. Lucien then reveals that he was never at the cottage by accident: he was sent by a mysterious Council to protect Red from a greater threat—the Wolf—and that Lucien himself is the Wolf's son. He declares Red is the last heir to a bloodline capable of ending the Wolf, and that Grandmother orchestrated the entire situation, manipulating every choice and danger they've faced. Red reels from these revelations, feeling betrayed by Lucien's secrecy and Grandmother's machinations. Elias supports Red, vowing to help her face the truth together. The chapter ends with Red and Elias confronting the enormity of the secrets revealed, questioning their roles as pawns or family, as the crackle of the hearth and distant caws of crows echo the uncertainty ahead."}, "output": {"dialogue": [{"speaker": "Red", "line": "It doesn’t smell like Grandmother’s soup in here.
