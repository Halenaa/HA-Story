Elias emerges from behind a birch tree, axe slung over his shoulder, observing the unfamiliar young woman and the cottage beyond with narrowed eyes; he pauses, listening to the rustle of leaves and the distant snap of a twig. The Wolf, disguised in the tattered cloak of a traveler, circles the perimeter, his nose twitching as he inhales the mingled smells of bread and old wood, calculating his approach. Inside, Grandmother secures the shutters and places a kettle on the crackling fire, her gaze darting to the door as she hears the faint, deliberate tap of claws on stone outside. Elias steps forward, voice low and wary, \"Evening, miss. Lost your way?\" Red hesitates, weighing the stranger’s intent, while the Wolf’s eyes gleam from the shadows, tracking each movement. The Wolf glances at Elias, lips curling in a near-human smile, and replies, \"Some roads are safer than others.\" The mist thickens as Grandmother cracks the door, peering into the gloom, her hand tightening on a wooden spoon. The result: Red, Elias, and the Wolf confront each other at the cottage threshold, each poised for a decisive move, while Grandmother prepares to defend her home against the unknown visitors.",

Her mother, brow furrowed, pressed a sealed envelope into Red’s hands, instructing her to deliver it to Grandmother at the forest’s edge. Red studied the wax seal, curiosity flickering in her eyes, and asked about the journey. In response, her mother moved to the window, pointing toward the shadowed line of trees, warning Red to stay on the path and avoid strangers. Red nodded, stuffing the envelope into her satchel and fastening her red cloak, motivated by the promise of adventure and concern for Grandmother. The kitchen filled with the sound of Red's boots scuffing across the stone floor as she prepared to depart.",

She pauses, bending to pick a cluster of violets, when a faint snapping of twigs makes her straighten and grip her cloak tighter. Elias emerges from behind a thick trunk, axe slung over his shoulder, eyes narrowed in cautious appraisal. He halts a few paces away and plants his boots firmly, voice low and steady as he calls out, warning her, 'Not safe to wander here alone. The wolf’s been seen nearby.' Red, undeterred, lifts her chin and replies, 'I’m going to my grandmother’s cottage. She’s expecting me.' Elias glances at the basket, then scans the shadowed woods behind her, shifting his grip on the axe. He offers to walk her part of the way, explaining that he knows the tracks of the wolf and can help her avoid danger. As they continue down the path together, Elias gestures toward fresh paw prints in the mud, pointing out signs Red has missed. Red listens intently, asking questions about the forest and the wolf, her curiosity piqued. The two move cautiously forward, leaves crunching underfoot, setting the stage for a wary alliance.",

Elias jogged beside her, axe gripped in one hand, pausing every few yards to listen for rustling in the undergrowth. As a low growl echoed from deeper within the woods, Elias motioned for Red to slow, whispering, 'Stay close. The wolf’s scent is fresher here.' Red nodded, determination sharpening her features, and together they pressed forward, Elias clearing tangled branches from their way while Red scanned for any sign of Grandmother’s cottage ahead. Their urgency grew with each step, spurred by the knowledge that the wolf had already outpaced them once before.",

Elias, a few paces behind, paused to scan the shadowed undergrowth, his hand tightening around the handle of his axe. From between the trees, The Wolf emerged, wearing the guise of a weary traveler—his coat dusty, eyes sharp beneath a drooping hat. He greeted them with a courteous nod, voice smooth as he asked if they were headed toward the cottage ahead. Elias interposed himself slightly between Red and the stranger, subtly shifting his stance to block the path. Red, still curious, replied that they were visiting her grandmother, her fingers brushing the rough bark of a nearby birch. The Wolf, eyes flickering, produced a small bundle of herbs from his pocket, offering them to Red as a supposed gift for her ailing grandmother. Elias watched closely, nostrils flaring as he caught an odd, musky scent beneath the herbs' fragrance. Red hesitated, glancing at Elias for guidance, but the Wolf pressed the bundle closer, insisting it would bring good health. Elias stepped forward, voice low, suggesting politely that they could find their own herbs, and thanked the traveler for his trouble. The Wolf's smile tightened, but he withdrew, his gaze lingering on Red as he melted back into the trees. The path ahead fell silent, the only sound the crunch of leaves underfoot as Elias urged Red onward, more alert than before.",

Elias wipes sweat from his brow, the scent of fresh pine clinging to his shirt, and sets the hammer down. Red, motivated by gratitude and a lingering question, steps closer and lays her hand over Elias's, her fingers lightly tracing the calluses. Elias hesitates, then turns to face her, his eyes searching hers for unspoken permission. He finally speaks, voice low and steady: 'You saved me as much as I tried to save you, Red.' Red, emboldened by the memory of their escape from the wolf, replies, 'I trust you, Elias. After all we've faced, I don't want to walk these woods alone anymore.' Elias responds by gently cupping her cheek, his thumb brushing away a strand of hair, and, after a long, searching look, he kisses her. The cottage door creaks open as Grandmother peers out, her motivation to check on Red evident as she calls, 'Supper's nearly ready, dears.' Red and Elias, their hands still entwined, exchange a soft smile before following Grandmother inside, united by the trials they've overcome and the bond they've formed.",
