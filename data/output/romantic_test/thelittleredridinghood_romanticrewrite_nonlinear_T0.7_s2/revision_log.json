        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shifts the confrontation from an immediate, silent standoff at the threshold to a tense but open negotiation, with Red, Elias, and the Wolf expressing their motives and suspicions directly. The Wolf clarifies he seeks a bargain, not violence, and Grandmother takes an active role in demanding honesty. This moves the plot from a poised, silent confrontation to a verbal, transparent reckoning and conditional entry. The motivations and character logic remain intact, but the nature of the confrontation is clarified and made more diplomatic.",

Red’s mother's warnings go beyond practical safety, suggesting old debts and unspoken truths. Red’s motivation now includes uncovering these mysteries, not just delivering the envelope and concern for Grandmother.",

Red also shows more emotional motivation (guilt about lateness) and curiosity about the wolf's nature. The plot is updated to include Elias's concern about needing to warn others, Red's guilt over lateness, and her deeper curiosity about the forest and the wolf, while maintaining the core alliance and cautious journey.",

Physical intimacy is replaced by mutual, explicit verbal consent and emotional vulnerability. The updated plot reflects this slower, more thoughtful emotional progression, while preserving the bond and unity established through adversity.",
