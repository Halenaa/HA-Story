Elias, intrigued by Red's audacity, agrees, setting the stage for their budding connection."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 3", "title": "Wolf’s Tempting Proposal", "summary": "The wolf, disguised as a traveler, intercepts Red and Elias, offering to guide them to grandmother’s house in exchange for a share of their basket. Elias suspects foul play and confronts the wolf. Red chooses to trust Elias, rejecting the wolf’s offer and causing the wolf to plot revenge."}, {"chapter_id": "Chapter 4", "title": "Race to Grandmother’s Cottage", "summary": "Red and Elias realize the wolf is heading toward the cottage ahead of them. They split up: Elias takes a shortcut to warn the grandmother, while Red tries to outrun the wolf on her path.

Introduce Red, Elias, the Wolf, and Grandmother for the first time, ensuring their relationships are unknown or ambiguous to the reader. Avoid referencing any prior familiarity between Red and Elias. Present the confrontation as an intense, pivotal event, but leave certain character motivations and histories mysterious to encourage curiosity. Dialogue and internal thoughts can hint at backstory without explicit exposition.", "transition_hint": "Begin in medias res, opening with immediate action in Grandmother's cottage.

The Wolf’s attempt to deceive Red and Elias should be laced with dramatic irony (the reader knows the wolf’s true nature, but the characters are not certain). Elias’s protective instincts and Red’s growing trust in him should be consistent with their relationship development up to this point.", "transition_hint": "Move from the heightened urgency of the race to Grandmother’s cottage to the unexpected encounter with the Wolf.
