The Wolf glances at Elias, lips curling in a near-human smile, and replies, \"Some roads are safer than others.\" The mist thickens as Grandmother cracks the door, peering into the gloom, her hand tightening on a wooden spoon. The result: Red, Elias, and the Wolf confront each other at the cottage threshold, each poised for a decisive move, while Grandmother prepares to defend her home against the unknown visitors."}}
