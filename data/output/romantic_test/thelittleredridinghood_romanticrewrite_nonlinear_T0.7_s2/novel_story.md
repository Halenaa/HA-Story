# Chapter 5: The Wolf’s Deception

Red approaches the mossy cottage, alert and resolute, her basket in hand and her intentions clear: to warn Grandmother of possible danger.

Elias emerges from the trees, vigilant and protective, confronting Red and the mysterious Wolf with a firm stance.

The Wolf, cloaked in the guise of a traveler, circles warily, making his presence and intentions known not with threats but with negotiation;

he claims he seeks something promised to him, not violence.

Grandmother, courageous and practical, asserts control over her home, demanding truth and transparency from each visitor before allowing anyone inside.

Red insists that no one enters until all intentions are honestly spoken, standing guard with Grandmother.

Elias voices his suspicion of the Wolf, but offers the chance for him to swear his intentions.

The Wolf accepts, swearing by Grandmother's hearth that he seeks only what was bargained, not bloodshed, but warns that hunger can drive desperation.

Red glances over her shoulder, voice low but steady, her eyes flickering between the stranger and the dark patch of woods where the Wolf’s gaze glints. Her fingers tighten around the basket handle, every muscle tensed, caught between distrust and fear. "I’m not sure what you want from me, but I’d rather know your purpose before I go any further. And if you’re thinking of following me… you should know you’re not the only one watching." ——Red

Grandmother invites each to step forward and prove themselves, refusing to let fear or secrecy govern her threshold.

Ultimately, all parties agree to face one another honestly in the light, prepared to judge who is friend and who is foe, prioritizing truth and safety above distrust and violence.

Grandmother squints into the swirling mist, her knuckles whitening around the spoon's worn handle as she pushes the door open a little farther, listening for any answer in the hush. "Is anyone out there? It's just me, now—don't you go sneaking about. This old spoon's seen more than porridge, mind you." ——Grandmother

GrandmotherShe leans forward, squinting into the swirling mist, her knuckles whitening around the spoon’s worn handle. "Oh, this fog’s no friend; if you’re lingering, best show yourself before supper gets cold." ——Grandmother

# Chapter 1: Red Receives the Invitation

Red sat at the worn wooden table, tracing the grain with her fingertip as her mother sliced warm bread, steam curling above each slice.

Her mother, brow furrowed, pressed a sealed envelope into Red’s hands, emphasizing the urgency: the envelope must reach Grandmother before nightfall.

Red’s MotherShe squeezes Red’s hands around the envelope, her eyes searching Red’s face for reassurance, worry flickering beneath her stern tone. "Red, listen to me carefully. This envelope must reach your grandmother before nightfall—she’s counting on you. The woods can be unpredictable, so stay on the main path and don’t linger. I trust you, but promise me you’ll be careful, darling." ——Red’s Mother

Red clutches the envelope tightly, glancing once at her mother before stepping toward the forest path, her heart pounding with a mix of determination and worry. "I promise, Mama—I’ll go straight there and back, and I won’t talk to anyone along the way." ——Red

She stressed the importance of the journey, warning Red to stay on the main path and not to linger or talk to strangers.

Red gently turns the sealed letter in her hands, eyes shifting from the ornate symbol to her mother's face, searching for answers. "Mother, this wax seal. it looks important. Where exactly are we going on this journey? Is there something I should know before we leave?" ——Red

Red’s MotherShe gently places her hand over Red’s, her eyes lingering on the seal as her voice softens with concern. "That seal carries both a warning and a promise, Red—our journey leads us through the old woods to Grandmama's, but there are paths best avoided and truths I haven't told you yet." ——Red’s Mother

Red leans in closer, her hand tightening around the sealed letter, her expression both anxious and eager for answers. "What kind of truths, Mother—are we in danger, or is there something about Grandmama I don't know?" ——Red

Red’s Mother gently folds the letter, her eyes lingering on the seal as she reaches for Red’s hand. "Some dangers are clear as day, Red, but others hide behind kindness and secrets—Grandmama's house holds both, and you must listen closely to what isn't said." ——Red’s Mother

Red leans forward, her voice hushed, fingers tracing the edge of the wax seal as her eyes search her mother's face for answers. "I'll listen, Mother, but please—what should I watch for in those woods, and what aren't you telling me about Grandmama?" ——Red

Red’s Mother gently presses the wax seal into Red’s palm, her gaze lingering on the edge of the darkening woods. "You must watch for shadows that whisper and eyes that linger too long, Red, for Grandmama's house is not only a haven but a place where old debts and promises wait to be claimed." ——Red’s Mother

Red leans in, gripping the wax-sealed letter tighter, her voice hushed with both fear and determination. "Mother, if there are debts and promises waiting, how will I know who to trust when I get there?" ——Red

Red’s Mother gently places her hand on Red’s shoulder, her gaze softening as she speaks. "Trust will not come from words or smiles, Red, but from the way a hand trembles when it reaches for you—let your heart guide you through the truths that linger in Grandmama's eyes." ——Red’s Mother

Red promised to follow these instructions.

Red’s MotherShe moves closer to the window, her voice firm but gentle, one hand pointing toward the dark cluster of trees beyond the garden. Her eyes search Red’s face, waiting for her daughter’s reply. "Red, listen to me. Stay on the path—don’t wander into the woods, no matter what. There are things out there you don’t understand, and not everyone you meet is kind. Promise me you’ll keep to the path and come straight back home." ——Red’s Mother

Red nods solemnly, glancing toward the dark trees with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension. "I promise, Mother—I won’t stray from the path, no matter what I see or hear." ——Red

However, Red’s curiosity led her to question the significance of the wax seal and whether there was more to the journey than delivering a message.

Her mother, unusually tense, alluded to secrets and past debts connected to Grandmother’s house, warning Red to be wary of hidden dangers and to trust her instincts above appearances.

The conversation took on a more mysterious and foreboding tone, with Red’s mother hinting at old promises and dangers that were not previously discussed.

Red, driven by concern for her grandmother as well as a desire to uncover the truth behind her mother’s warnings, prepared to depart, her resolve deepened by the new layers of mystery.

The kitchen filled with the sound of Red's boots scuffing across the stone floor as she set out, more alert and cautious than before.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 2: Encounter at the Forest Path

Red steps carefully over twisted roots, her basket swinging at her side, scanning the underbrush for wildflowers to bring to her grandmother.

She pauses, bending to pick a cluster of violets, when a faint snapping of twigs makes her straighten and grip her cloak tighter.

Elias emerges from behind a thick trunk, axe slung over his shoulder, eyes narrowed in cautious appraisal.

He halts a few paces away, planting his boots firmly, his voice low and steady as he calls out, warning her about the dangers in the woods and questioning her presence.

Elias halts a few paces away, boots planted firmly in the soft earth. His eyes scan the gloom beyond her, wary but unwavering, as he waits for her reply. "Not safe to wander here alone. Shadows move quick in these woods, and not all of ‘em are friendly. You looking for trouble, or just lost your way?" ——Elias

Elias expresses concern that the wolf may be closer than he thought and says he needs to warn others, but he still offers to accompany Red.

Elias glances nervously at the edge of the woods, his hand tightening around the handle of his lantern as he considers his next move. "The wolf—here? I knew the rumors were spreading, but I didn't think it would come this close. If it's true, I need to warn the others before nightfall." ——Elias

Red, undeterred and determined, insists she must reach her grandmother and expresses guilt over past lateness.

Red stands tall, her eyes unwavering, her grip tightening on the small basket she carries as she prepares to set off down the forest path. "I’m going to my grandmother’s cottage. She’s waiting for me, and nothing is going to stop me from making sure she’s safe." ——Red

She accepts Elias's offer, and as they continue, Elias gestures toward fresh paw prints in the mud, pointing out signs Red missed.

Red checks their watch nervously, quickens their pace down the dimly lit hallway. "She's expecting me—I can't be late again. Last time, she waited for hours. This time, I owe her more than just an apology." ——Red

Red listens intently, her curiosity piqued, asking about the forest, the wolf, and the truth behind the stories.

The two move cautiously forward, leaves crunching underfoot, setting the stage for a wary alliance.

Elias offers a warm, reassuring smile, stepping beside her without crowding, his posture open and protective, signaling genuine concern rather than control. "If you’re heading through the woods, you ought to let me walk with you for a while. I know the tracks of the wolf—where he hunts, where he lingers. It’s easy to miss the signs if you don’t know what to look for, and I’d hate for you to run into trouble alone. I’m not trying to intrude, I just want to make sure you’re safe. Trust me; I’ve lived out here long enough to spot danger before it finds us." ——Elias

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Race to Grandmother’s Cottage

Red clutched the basket tighter, her boots splashing through puddles as she hurried along the winding path, eyes scanning for movement between the trees.

Elias jogged beside her, axe gripped in one hand, pausing every few yards to listen for rustling in the undergrowth.

As a low growl echoed from deeper within the woods, Elias motioned for Red to stay behind him, cautioning her to avoid drawing the wolf's attention.

Elias scans the shadowy trees, placing himself protectively between Red and the source of the growl, his hand subtly reaching for the hilt of his knife as he crouches low, signaling for Red to do the same. "Did you hear that? Something's out there—keep behind me, Red. We can't risk drawing its attention." ——Elias

RedShe scanned the darkening trees, eyes wide, heart thudding in her chest, ready to follow his lead. "Red nodded, swallowing hard, her hand tightening around the worn handle of her axe as she pressed closer to Elias." ——Red

EliasHe shifted his stance protectively, scanning the shadowy underbrush for any sign of movement. "Elias murmured, 'No sudden moves—if it senses we're afraid, it'll come closer.'" ——Elias

RedShe glanced up at Elias, jaw set, the tremor in her voice betraying her nerves even as she tried to steady her grip on the axe. "Red whispered, 'I'm not afraid—just tell me when to run or when to fight.'" ——Red

Red nodded, steeling herself and gripping her own axe, ready to act if necessary.

Elias crouches low, scanning the underbrush intently for any sign of movement, hand instinctively moving to rest on his weapon. "The wolf’s scent is much stronger here—far fresher than before. It can’t be far ahead now. I need to be on my guard." ——Elias

Elias slows his pace, scanning the shadows and gripping his weapon tighter as he follows the trail. "I should move quietly and keep my weapon ready—there’s every chance the wolf is watching me right now." ——Elias

Elias reminded her not to make sudden moves, noting that fear might attract the wolf.

Red whispered her resolve, assuring Elias of her readiness to fight or flee at his signal.

The wolf’s scent grew stronger, making Elias even more alert.

He moved quietly, weapon at the ready, convinced the wolf could be watching them.

Together, with heightened caution and determination, Red and Elias pressed forward, both bracing for an imminent encounter as they searched for any sign of Grandmother’s cottage.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Wolf’s Tempting Proposal

Red and Elias walk together along the forest path toward Grandmother's cottage.

Red pauses to admire wildflowers while Elias remains alert, scanning the undergrowth.

The Wolf appears, disguised as a weary traveler, and greets them with a courteous nod, asking about their destination.

Elias steps protectively between Red and the Wolf.

The Wolf inclines his head politely, keeping a respectful distance, eyes watchful but not overtly threatening. He gestures subtly toward the winding trail that leads to the cottage, his tone charming yet tinged with curiosity. "Good afternoon. I couldn't help but notice you walking this way—headed for the cottage, I presume? It's rare to see travelers on this path. May I ask your purpose?" ——The Wolf

RedShe tightened her grip on the basket, watching the Wolf warily for any sign of ulterior motives. "Red hesitated, glancing at Elias before replying, 'We're just visiting family—my grandmother lives in the cottage up ahead.'" ——Red

EliasHe met the Wolf's gaze steadily, subtly positioning himself a half-step closer to Red. "Elias kept his tone friendly but measured as he replied, 'Just making sure Red gets there safely—these woods can be unpredictable.'" ——Elias

The WolfHe steps slightly to the side, gesturing toward the path as if inviting them to continue, but his gaze lingers on Red, watchful and curious. "The Wolf's smile widened, eyes glinting with interest as he replied, 'How fortunate your grandmother is to receive visitors—these woods hold many stories, and not all are told by friendly faces.'" ——The Wolf

RedShe subtly stepped closer to Elias, her gaze steady on the Wolf, signaling both caution and resolve. "Red's grip tightened on her basket as she answered, 'We appreciate the warning, but we know these woods well enough not to get lost in stories—or in trouble.'" ——Red

The WolfHe stepped aside from the path, a gesture both inviting and unobtrusive, his gaze lingering on Red and Elias as he awaited their response. "The Wolf inclined his head, voice velvet-soft as he remarked, 'Wisdom and caution serve you well—perhaps I might accompany you a short way, for safety in numbers is never unwelcome.'" ——The Wolf

Red hesitantly explains they are visiting family—her grandmother.

The Wolf offers a bundle of herbs as a gift for Grandmother, claiming their health benefits.

Red trails her fingertips along the rough birch bark, glancing around with wide, curious eyes. Her voice is soft, a hint of wonder and nervousness in its tone. "I'm just on my way to see my grandmother. She lives on the other side of the forest." ——Red

Red is uncertain and seeks Elias's guidance.

Instead of outright rejecting the herbs, Elias suggests examining them together and proposes testing a small amount for safety, demonstrating his cautious nature but also a willingness to learn.

Red, reassured by Elias, accepts a single leaf and inspects it, still anxious.

Red shifts her weight from foot to foot, her eyes flickering anxiously between Elias and the Wolf, fingers hovering uncertainly above the bundle. "Um. Elias, do you really think I should take this? It just—feels strange." ——Red

Elias steps slightly closer to Red, signaling quiet encouragement, while the Wolf leans in eagerly, eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Elias offered a gentle nod, his eyes steady on Red as he replied, 'If you trust your instincts, Red, I’ll support your choice—just remember, sometimes what feels strange can help us grow.'" ——Elias

The Wolf leaned in, voice low and earnest, pressing the bundle into Red’s hands as his amber eyes searched her face for a flicker of trust. "Please, Red—herbs like these kept my whole family strong through the harshest winters; I’d never steer you wrong." ——The Wolf

RedShe shifted her weight, torn between caution and the hope of newfound strength. "Red bit her lip, glancing between Elias and the Wolf, her fingers hovering uncertainly over the bundle." ——Red

EliasHe reached out a hand, inviting Red to bring the bundle closer so they could examine it side by side. "Elias leaned in slightly, his tone reassuring yet cautious: 'If you’re unsure, we can look at the herbs together—no harm in learning more before you decide.'" ——Elias

RedShe drew the bundle closer but did not yet unwrap it, her eyes searching Elias’s face for reassurance while the Wolf watched expectantly. "Red nodded slowly, her voice barely above a whisper as she said, 'Alright, let’s look together—maybe then I’ll feel better about it.'" ——Red

The Wolf carefully unwrapped a corner of the bundle, holding it out invitingly for Red and Elias to inspect, his amber eyes keen and persuasive. "Of course—let me show you the leaves up close, see how vibrant they are; their scent alone can clear a weary head." ——The Wolf

Red hesitated, her hand trembling as she held the bundle closer to Elias, seeking reassurance in his steady presence. "Red inhaled the earthy aroma, her uncertainty lingering as she murmured, 'They do smell fresh, but are you sure they're safe for me?'" ——Red

The Wolf met Red's gaze, earnest and unwavering, gently nudging the bundle toward her open hands. "Absolutely, Red—I've used these same herbs myself, and I promise, nothing but good has ever come from them." ——The Wolf

EliasHe offered Red an encouraging smile, his hand steadying hers as she hesitated over the bundle. "Elias studied the Wolf's earnest face, then gently suggested, 'Perhaps we test just a small bit first, Red, and see how you feel—caution and trust can go hand in hand.'" ——Elias

RedHer breath quickened, caught between the Wolf’s eager encouragement and Elias’s steady, watchful gaze. "Red hesitated, fingers trembling as she finally accepted a single leaf, glancing anxiously at Elias for reassurance before bringing it close to her lips." ——Red

The Wolf presses the herbs' virtues, but ultimately Elias politely declines the further offer, stating they can gather herbs themselves.

Elias steps back with a gentle nod, hands folded, signaling respectful resolve. "Thank you for your offer, truly. But I believe we can manage to gather the herbs ourselves. Your help is appreciated, though—we’ll be all right from here." ——Elias

The Wolf inclines his head, a faint smile touching his lips before he steps back, giving Elias and his companions space. "Of course—may your search be fruitful, then." ——The Wolf

The Wolf withdraws, wishing them luck.

The encounter leaves Red and Elias more wary, but with Red's curiosity satisfied and Elias's protective instincts affirmed.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: Revelations and Romantic Decision

Red stands by the stacked firewood, brushing dirt from her skirt as she surveys the repaired window Elias has just finished hammering into place.

Red folds her arms, glancing from the window to the tree line, worry flickering across her face before softening her tone for Elias. "You did a good job, Elias. I’m grateful—truly. I just wish we didn’t have to fix the window at all. Nights feel different lately, don’t they?" ——Red

Elias sets down his hammer, glancing over his shoulder at the darkening treeline, his jaw tightening just a bit. "You're right, they do—and I wish I could say this was the last window I'd have to mend for you, Red." ——Elias

Red offers Elias a small, tired smile, her fingers lingering on the edge of the windowsill as she glances out into the shadowed woods. "Still, having you here makes it easier to believe tomorrow will be quieter than tonight." ——Red

Elias wipes sweat from his brow, the scent of fresh pine clinging to his shirt, and sets the hammer down.

Elias leans back against a half-finished wall, gazing at the framework with a tired but satisfied smile, his fingers tracing the grain of the wood. "Whew. that's enough for now, I think. Funny how the smell of pine sticks to you—almost like it's trying to remind me that every swing of the hammer is worth it. It's hard work, sure, but somehow it feels right. Maybe when this cabin stands tall, I’ll finally have a place that’s all my own." ——Elias

The two share a moment reflecting on the recent repairs and the lasting tension in the woods, expressing gratitude and a growing sense of partnership.

Red gently curls her fingers around Elias's hand, her thumb brushing over the roughness of his skin, her gaze searching his face for answers. "Elias, I never truly thanked you—for everything. For pulling me from the river that night, for staying even when there was nothing in it for you. I keep wondering. why? Why did you choose me, of all people? Was it just chance, or something more?" ——Red

Elias's fingers turn beneath Red's, gently curling around her hand, his gaze steady and open, searching her face for understanding. "Red, I couldn't walk away—not when I saw the fight still burning in your eyes; maybe it was chance, or maybe it was the way you reached for hope even as the water closed in." ——Elias

Red's thumb brushes gently over Elias's knuckles, her gaze searching his face for any sign of hesitation or truth. "Your belief in me—it changed something inside, Elias; I suppose I need to understand if you saw in me what I still struggle to see myself." ——Red

Elias's hand trembles slightly beneath Red's touch, his gaze steady but softened by vulnerability. "I saw a strength in you that reminded me of the part of myself I thought I'd lost, and perhaps saving you was my way of reclaiming it." ——Elias

Red, motivated by lingering questions and gratitude, asks Elias why he chose to stay and help her, leading to an honest exchange about their motivations and the hope they've inspired in each other.

Elias hesitates, voice low and tentative. He studies Red's face, waiting for any sign—an encouraging glance, a nod, a gentle smile—that might tell him how she feels. "Red. is this okay? I—I'm not sure where we stand right now." ——Elias

Red softens her gaze, tilting her head slightly as she takes a tentative step closer, inviting honesty without pressure. "It's okay, Elias—just tell me what you're feeling, and we'll figure this out together." ——Red

Elias's voice is low and uncertain, his hands fidgeting at his sides as he waits for her answer. "I just don't want to cross a line we can't come back from, Red." ——Elias

Red steps closer, her gaze steady and reassuring, offering him a gentle nod. "You won't cross any lines unless I ask you to, Elias—I'm right here with you." ——Red

Elias exhales softly, the tension in his shoulders easing as he studies her face for further reassurance. "Elias: Thank you, Red—I just needed to hear that from you." ——Elias

Their conversation deepens as they openly discuss their feelings, with both admitting their care for one another and their desire to move forward together, yet also carefully respecting boundaries and consent.

Grandmother opens the cottage door, welcoming them inside for supper, expressing her pride and love for who they are becoming.

Red and Elias, hands still close but not yet crossing into full physical intimacy, exchange a smile before heading in, united by trust, honesty, and the shared trials they've overcome.
