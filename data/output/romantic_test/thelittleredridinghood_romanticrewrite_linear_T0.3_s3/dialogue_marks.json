The air is tense as a crow caws above, and Elias finally offers, 'I was tracking something dangerous—something that follows you.' Their conversation ends with Elias insisting on escorting her, and the two set off together, muddy boots squelching as they vanish deeper into the trees.",

Elias approaches from the forest path, boots muffled by wet leaves, axe slung over his shoulder. He pauses, scanning the woods for movement, then calls out in a low voice, 'You shouldn't be outside alone so early, Red.' Red straightens, brushing dirt from her palms, and replies, 'Grandmother needs these for her tea. I can't wait.' Elias steps closer, kneeling to help her pull stubborn roots free from the soil. As Red gathers the herbs into her basket, Elias sets his axe down and inspects the cottage windows, checking the latches. Together, they carry the basket inside, Elias's vigilant gaze lingering on the tree line, driven by his determination to keep Red safe. Red, focused on her grandmother's recovery, thanks Elias but insists she can handle herself, determined to prove her independence.",
