# Chapter 1: Red Receives Grandmother's Letter

Red stands at the kitchen table, fingers tracing the embossed seal on a parchment envelope she just retrieved from the doorstep.

Her mother, wiping flour from her hands, watches as Red carefully breaks the seal and unfolds the letter.

Red reads aloud Grandmother's urgent request for help, her voice steady but filled with concern.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red lowers the letter, her brow furrowed with concern, and looks toward the path leading to Grandmother's cottage, her resolve clear in her eyes. "Dear Grandmother writes, 'My dearest Red, I find myself growing weaker with every passing day, and simple tasks now feel like mountains to climb. If you could come soon, it would ease my heart more than words can say.' Grandmother's request sounds so urgent, I mustn't waste a moment." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Grandmother's voice trembles softly as she presses her handkerchief to her lips, hoping Red will understand how much she needs her. "Oh, my sweet child, I didn't wish to worry you, but it's been so lonely and difficult here—your visit would mean the world to me." ——Grandmother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs the letter to her chest, determination shining in her eyes as she moves quickly to prepare for the journey. "Grandmother, you mean everything to me—I'll gather my things and be on my way before the sun is high." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Grandmother’s voice echoes in Red’s mind, expressing her loneliness and need for Red’s presence.

Red's MotherShe gently closes the door to keep out the draft, then turns to the old wooden cupboard, rummaging through jars until she finds the small, amber one filled with fragrant herbal ointment. She presses it into Red's hand, her expression firm but caring. "Red, before you go, take this salve to your Grandmother. The mornings have been chilly, and her joints ache more than ever. I made this fresh last night—see that she rubs it in well." ——Red's Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tucks the small jar carefully into the pocket of her cloak, glancing at her mother for further instructions. "Of course, Mother—I’ll make sure she uses it, and I’ll stay with her awhile if she needs help." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Moved by her grandmother’s words, Red reassures her mother of her determination to help and her willingness to stay with Grandmother as long as needed.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red adjusts her cloak firmly around her shoulders and lifts the basket, determination shining in her eyes as she glances back at her mother with a reassuring smile. "I know the woods can be dangerous, Mother, but Grandmother needs these treats, and I promise I’ll be careful. I can’t just ignore her when she’s ill." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe gently places her hands on Red's shoulders, her eyes filled with worry. "I understand, dear, but you must stay on the path, speak to no strangers, and come straight home after—promise me you’ll remember these things?" ——Red's Mother

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tighter and meets her mother’s worried eyes with a determined smile. "I promise, Mother—I’ll remember every word, and I won’t let anything distract me from getting to Grandmother safely." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Her mother moves to close the door against the morning breeze, then rummages in a wooden cupboard for a jar of herbal salve, insisting Red bring it for Grandmother’s aching joints.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red reaches out with both hands, accepting the jar from her mother, her fingers brushing against her mother's for a lingering moment, sensing the weight of worry behind her mother's gentle smile. "I promise, Mother, I’ll stay right on the path and won’t talk to any strangers. I know how important this is." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red's MotherShe gently presses the jar into Red's hands, her eyes lingering with worry and hope as she lets go. "Take this, dearest—keep it close, and remember every step you take matters to both of us." ——Red's Mother

Red promises not only to deliver the salve but also to ensure Grandmother uses it and to remain vigilant on her journey.

She gathers her cloak and basket, reiterates her promise to heed her mother’s warnings about the forest, and receives a final reminder and embrace as she sets out on her journey.

# Chapter 2: Red Meets the Mysterious Woodsman

Red, gripping a wicker basket filled with jars from the apothecary, steps carefully over a fallen log, pausing to adjust her red cloak against a sudden gust.

She scans the underbrush, alert for signs of danger as she pursues her mission to deliver medicine to her grandmother.

Elias emerges from behind a thicket, axe slung across his shoulder, and blocks her path, eyes narrowed with concern.

He glances at the basket, then the shadows between the trees.

'You shouldn't be this deep in the woods alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and direct, his motivation to protect her evident in his stance.

Red sidesteps, lifting her chin.

'My grandmother needs these remedies, Elias.

I won't let fear keep me back.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clenches her basket a little tighter, takes a deep breath, and steps determinedly onto the forest path, her chin held high. "I can do this. No matter what stories I've heard or how dark the woods look, I won't let fear keep me back. Grandma is counting on me, and I have to be brave—for her, and for myself." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red straightens her hood, takes a deep breath, and steps confidently onto the winding forest path. "Even if my heart races with every snap of a twig, I'll keep moving forward, because courage means walking through the fear, not avoiding it." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

' Elias shifts, studying the trail ahead, then steps forward to clear a branch from her way, his actions deliberate.

'Let me walk with you,' he offers, determined to prove his reliability.

Red hesitates but nods, and the two proceed together, their footsteps muffled by the dense moss, as crows call overhead.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: The Wolf's Offer and Hidden Agenda

Red steps carefully along the moist trail, basket clutched tightly, her boots sinking slightly into the soft leaf litter.

Lucien, disguised as a traveler with a cloak pulled over his sharp eyes, emerges from behind a fallen log and offers to guide Red through a shortcut, his voice low and persuasive.

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps from the shadow of the fallen log, his cloak hiding the outline of his frame, but a glint of sharpness remains in his eyes. He gestures toward a narrow trail winding deeper into the forest, his tone smooth and inviting—a practiced charm masking something beneath. "Evening, traveler. The woods grow thick ahead, and the path you’re on. it twists more than most. If you’re seeking your grandmother’s cottage, I know a quicker way. Less tangled, less trouble. May I show you?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, glancing down the winding trail, clutching her basket tighter as curiosity flickers in her eyes. "That’s kind of you, but Mama always warns me to keep to the main path—still, I suppose you look like you know these woods better than most." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps lightly over a gnarled root, his gaze flickering to Red's basket as he gestures deeper into the thicket, smile hidden beneath his hood. "Wise advice from your mother, no doubt, but not all dangers in these woods walk on four legs—sometimes, it’s the shadows themselves; tell me, why do you journey alone so late?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket a little closer, glancing at Lucien’s eyes beneath his hood, her voice careful but tinged with concern. "I promised Grandmother I’d bring her bread and honey before nightfall—she hasn’t been well, and I couldn’t let her wait another day." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps closer, his cloak swirling, extending an arm with a practiced gesture, inviting Red to follow while his gaze lingers a moment too long. "Then let me guide you—my eyes have mapped every bend here, and your kindness deserves safe passage." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red adjusts her basket nervously, glancing at Lucien’s cloaked figure as she steps a cautious pace closer to his side. "I suppose a little help wouldn’t hurt, so long as you promise we’ll reach Grandmother’s safely before dark." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red hesitates, recalling her mother's warnings, and questions Lucien about his knowledge of the woods, engaging in a tense verbal exchange where she repeatedly presses for clarity and resists Lucien's vague answers.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red pauses mid-step, clutching her basket tighter and glancing sideways at Lucien, her eyes narrowed with suspicion. "Lucien, are you sure this is the right way? The trees feel different here—closer, almost like they're watching us. How well do you really know these woods?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien glances over his shoulder, a faint, knowing smile tugging at his lips as he leads Red deeper along the winding path. "Every bend and shadow here is familiar to me, Red—these woods reveal their secrets only to those who know how to listen." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, clutching her basket tighter as she slows her steps, her gaze flickering between Lucien and the thickening underbrush. "If you know them so well, why do I feel like we're being led somewhere I haven't chosen?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien glances back at Red, a faint, knowing smile curling at the edge of his mouth as the canopy above thickens, muting the light. "Because sometimes the woods don't wait for choices—they draw you where you most need to go, whether you realize it or not." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, glancing sideways at Lucien with narrowed eyes, her steps slowing as if she might turn back. "That sounds more like a warning than comfort, Lucien—what is it you think I need to find out here?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps forward, his eyes glinting in the dim light as the branches seem to close in tighter around them. "Perhaps what you need isn't something to find, but something waiting to find you, Red." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stops walking, her hand tightening around her basket as she studies Lucien's face for any hint of the answer she fears. "If that's true, then tell me—what is it that's waiting for me, Lucien, and why does it feel like you already know?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien's eyes glint in the gloom as he steps further into the thickening shadows, inviting Red to follow. "Ah, Red, sometimes the woods whisper secrets meant only for those willing to hear—and I’ve learned to listen better than most." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red pauses, her hand tightening around the basket as she locks eyes with Lucien, unwilling to move another step until he answers. "Then maybe you can finally tell me what the trees are whispering now—because I’m tired of walking blind." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien’s gaze lingers on Red, his eyes gleaming with something unreadable as he gestures toward a twisting trail obscured by mist. "The trees speak of crossroads and choices, Red—paths where trust and danger walk side by side." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket and narrows her eyes, slowing her steps as she scrutinizes Lucien’s face for any sign of deceit. "Trust and danger might walk together, but I still need to know which one you’re leading me toward, Lucien." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps closer, his eyes glinting in the dim light, as a hush falls over the woods around them. "Isn't it curious how sometimes the safest guide is also the one you fear most?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, gripping her basket tighter and glancing at the winding trail as if ready to turn back or forge a new direction. "If you want me to trust you, Lucien, then stop speaking in riddles and show me the path ahead—otherwise, I’ll find my own way through these shadows." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien attempts to earn her trust with poetic hints about the forest, but Red stands firm, insisting on leading and demanding transparency.

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps forward, his voice low and reassuring, his presence closing the small distance between them as he gently gestures for Red to follow him onto the faint trail, his gaze holding hers just a moment longer than necessary. "If you look closely, you’ll see the path barely worn between the brambles—most wouldn’t notice it, but I know every bend. I’ve walked it countless times, and it’s far safer than the main road. The forest listens here; you’re under my watch, Red, nothing will trouble you." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, studying Lucien’s expression while keeping a cautious step back, her hand lightly brushing the edge of her cloak. "I appreciate your guidance, Lucien, but how can you be certain nothing lurks where even the brambles hide the way?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps gently into the narrow trail, brushing a thorny branch aside with practiced ease, his shoulder almost brushing Red's as he gestures for her to follow. "Because the forest keeps its secrets closest to those who listen, and I’ve learned its language—each rustle, each shadow speaks to me, and none would dare whisper harm while you walk at my side." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances sidelong at Lucien, her steps slowing just enough to let the space between them narrow, eyes searching his face for sincerity. "It’s a lovely thought, Lucien, but secrets have a way of turning sharp when least expected—will you promise to warn me if the forest’s language changes, even if the words are meant for you alone?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps just close enough that the warmth of his presence brushes Red’s arm, his gaze steady and reassuring. "I give you my word, Red—if the forest so much as murmurs ill intent, you’ll feel my hand at your shoulder before the danger finds its name." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Lucien ultimately concedes, promising to warn her of any danger and agreeing to follow at a respectful distance.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red pushes past Lucien, her jaw set, slipping her hand into her cloak pocket where the handle of a knife is hidden. She glances back over her shoulder, eyes narrowed, daring Lucien to challenge her authority as she leads the way into the dense trees. "Fine. But if we're doing this, we do it my way. I know these woods better than you ever could, and I don't trust what I can't see ahead. Stay close, but not too close." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien offers a wry smile, his eyes sharp as he falls into step a few paces back, hands open and visible, watching Red's every move. "Understood, Red—you lead, I'll follow, but remember, I see more than most, even from behind." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the hidden knife and strides forward, casting a wary glance over her shoulder at Lucien. "Just keep your eyes where they belong, Lucien, and save your clever tricks for someone who cares." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Their journey continues along the narrower trail, with Red maintaining control and Lucien observing her intently, motivated by his desire to gain her trust and affection while concealing his true nature.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Lucien Deceives Grandmother

Lucien, disguised as Red, enters Grandmother's cottage and attempts to coax information from her not only about her remedies but also about Red herself.

Their conversation becomes a careful game of subtext and verbal sparring, with Grandmother cleverly dodging Lucien's probing questions about both the location of her remedies and Red's whereabouts or intentions.

Lucien grows increasingly curious and persistent, subtly admitting his interest in Red's safety and asking if she walks alone or expects to meet anyone.

Grandmother, remaining protective and wise, offers ambiguous answers, refusing to give up any details that might endanger Red.

The mood is tense but controlled, with both characters aware of the other's true nature and motivations.

Lucien's conflicted desire to protect and/or pursue Red comes to the forefront, while Grandmother's resourcefulness is displayed in her evasive responses.

The scene ends with neither gaining the upper hand, but with both acutely aware of the stakes should Red actually arrive.

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans forward, voice velvet-soft but edged with urgency, his gaze flickering to the door as his ears angle to catch the faintest footstep from outside. "Grandmother, your cottage is so cozy. yet, I can't help but notice a certain scent in the air. Something medicinal, perhaps? Tell me, where do you keep your remedies? I imagine they're quite precious—especially with unexpected visitors on the way." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Grandmother's eyes flick toward the heavy oak cabinet in the corner, fingers tightening imperceptibly around her shawl. "Ah, Lucien, remedies are safest where only old hands remember, and some doors are best left unopened when wolves and girls prowl the woods." ——Grandmother

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans forward, voice barely above a whisper, his gaze flickering nervously toward the door as the wind rattles the latch. "Of course, memories linger longer than pawprints—yet, should a sudden chill find its way inside, wouldn't it be wise to have your cure close at hand?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Grandmother’s eyes flicker toward the fireplace as her hand unconsciously tightens around her shawl, her ear attuned to the crunch of leaves just beyond the cottage door. "Sometimes the cure is hidden in plain sight, Lucien, just beneath the hearthstone—though not every guest knows how to lift it without burning their fingers." ——Grandmother

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans forward, his gaze flickering briefly to the hearth, ears pricked for the crunch of leaves outside. "Perhaps I've grown accustomed to the heat, Grandmother—still, I wonder which stone warms your remedy best when shadows stretch long and Red’s footsteps echo near." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Grandmother’s eyes flick to the door, her gnarled hand tightening around her shawl as she listens for the crunch of footsteps outside. "A clever wolf might find the right stone warmer than the rest, but only a wary heart knows when to let it cool, especially when Red’s shadow falls across the threshold." ——Grandmother

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: Red's Suspicion and Elias's Return

Red adjusts her heavy red cloak and carefully steps over a slick tree root, her basket of herbs swinging at her side as she moves purposefully toward her grandmother's cottage.

Elias emerges from between two mossy trunks, axe slung over his shoulder, blocking her path with a wary glance.

Instead of expressing direct concern for her walking alone, Elias immediately inquires if Red has seen any unfamiliar faces in the area, hinting at unease about strangers in the forest.

Red acknowledges her urgency to deliver the apothecary's remedy to her ailing grandmother and, though proud of her ability to travel the woods alone, pragmatically accepts Elias's offer to accompany her, recognizing the danger and valuing his company.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches the basket tighter, glancing nervously down the path before forcing herself to walk steadily onward. "I must hurry—I have the apothecary's remedy for Grandmother, and she’s counting on me. That’s all that matters right now." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red asserts her capability and requests that Elias trust her judgement if they encounter trouble.

Elias steps closer, keeping his tone casual but his eyes scanning the area, careful not to draw attention from those nearby. "Excuse me, have you noticed anyone around here lately that you didn't recognize? Maybe someone new in town, or just passing through?" ——Elias

Elias agrees, emphasizing the need for teamwork given the heightened dangers in the forest.

They set off together, their boots sinking into the mud as they disappear deeper into the trees, both alert to the possibility of encountering more than the usual perils.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Confrontation and Rescue

Red steps onto the mossy path, clutching a satchel of herbal remedies, determined to reach her grandmother before nightfall.

Lucien, disguised as a traveler, emerges from behind a bramble and offers to carry her satchel, his voice smooth and persuasive.

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps forward with a practiced smile, his gloved hand extended, blocking the narrow path with casual authority. His eyes, bright and attentive, linger just a moment too long on Red as he waits for her reply. "My, that satchel looks dreadfully heavy for someone traveling alone through these woods. Allow me, won’t you? It would be a shame if you tired yourself before reaching grandmother’s house. I insist—no trouble at all." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts the satchel higher on her shoulder, her gaze steady and wary, taking a small step back from Lucien. "Thank you for your concern, but I've managed just fine on my own so far—and I prefer to keep my things close, if you don't mind." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps aside gracefully, his eyes lingering on Red with a reassuring, almost hypnotic smile. "Of course, independence suits you—though a little help can be a comfort on paths as unpredictable as these." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the satchel, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studies Lucien's smile, weighing his charm against the whisper of unease in her chest. "That may be, but I've learned the forest is safest when I trust my own two hands—and my instincts." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps aside with a courteous bow, his eyes lingering on Red's satchel, a subtle smile playing at his lips. "Ah, wise beyond your years—yet even the keenest instincts can falter when shadows grow long." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her satchel higher on her shoulder, her eyes narrowing slightly as she studies Lucien’s face, searching for any hint of deception. "Perhaps, but daylight’s still holding strong, and I know these woods better than most." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps aside with a gracious sweep of his arm, his gaze lingering on Red with a disarming, wolfish smile. "Then let us walk together, at least, so we might share the path and its stories—surely there’s no harm in company, is there?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red shifts her satchel higher on her shoulder, watching Lucien's eyes for any flicker of disappointment or intent. "Company can be pleasant, so long as it doesn't ask for more than is freely given." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red refuses his help, firmly asserting her independence and questioning Lucien's purpose.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, her gaze unwavering as she shifts her satchel behind her, keeping it close and secure. "I don't need your help, stranger. What brings you out here, lurking in the shadows? People don't wander this path without a reason." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien's lips curve into a thin, unsettling smile as he steps just close enough for his shadow to stretch toward her boots. "Curiosity, perhaps—or maybe I simply enjoy the company of those who think themselves safest alone." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, her gaze unwavering and her grip on the satchel firm, ready to defend herself if necessary. "If you're just curious, you won't mind telling me exactly what you're after—because I won't let anyone threaten me or mine." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien tilts his head, a faint smile playing at the corner of his mouth, eyes glinting as he steps just close enough to test her resolve. "Let's call it a mutual interest in what you carry, Red, but rest assured—I never threaten unless provoked." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, her gaze unwavering as she shifts her weight, ready to move if Lucien edges closer. "Then you'd best keep your distance and answer plainly, because I'm not one to provoke easily—but I don't trust anyone with 'mutual interests' in my belongings." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps closer, the faint curl of a smile flickering at the edge of his mouth, eyes fixed unwaveringly on her satchel. "Trust is a luxury out here, Red—and my interests rarely walk away unmet." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red lifts her chin defiantly, her fingers edging closer to the hidden knife at her belt. "If your interests concern my satchel, you'd better explain yourself now, before I decide you're more threat than curiosity." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps closer, his gaze sharpening, a faint smile curling at the edges of his mouth. "Suppose I told you what's in your satchel might save a life—or end one, depending on whose hands it's in." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands her ground, chin lifted defiantly, her grip on the satchel unyielding as she fixes Lucien with a cold, unwavering stare. "Then you won't be getting your hands on it—so say what you mean, or step aside." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien's gaze sharpens, his stance shifting subtly as if ready to block her way, a faint, unsettling smile curving his lips. "Isn't it wiser to know who walks beside you, Red, before you decide which path to defend so fiercely?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, eyes never leaving Lucien as she angles her body protectively between him and her satchel. "I know exactly which path I'm on—and I don't need to know you to know I won't let you steer me off it." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Their conversation deepens, moving beyond simple suspicion to a nuanced exchange about trust, loneliness, and the risk of opening oneself to others.

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans lightly against the doorframe, his eyes glinting with a conspiratorial warmth, as he waits for Red's reply, hoping to sense a sliver of shared wonder or loneliness. "You know, the forest keeps so many secrets—sometimes I wonder if the trees themselves whisper to those willing to listen; have you ever felt the hush just before dusk, as if the woods are holding their breath for a special guest?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances toward the latch on the cottage door, her fingers resting protectively on the handle as she studies Lucien's face for any flicker of intent. "Sometimes I hear things—soft footsteps, maybe, or a voice I can't quite place—but I always keep the door shut until I know who's really come calling." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans in, his eyes glinting with a mix of earnestness and mystery, fingertips grazing the doorframe as if seeking silent permission to cross its threshold. "Ah, but isn't it lonely, locking the world away, never knowing whether the next knock might bring a friend—or a story that could change everything?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans forward just enough to peer through the slightly parted curtains, eyes flickering with interest but her hand still firmly on the latch. "Maybe, but stories can slip through cracks and keyholes—even when the door stays closed." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans closer, voice low and inviting, fingertips just brushing the edge of the cottage's worn threshold as if tracing the outline of possibility. "Then allow me to offer a tale, right here in the hush between us—a tale of a traveler who found warmth not in the open road, but in the soft glow behind a guarded door." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans forward just a little, eyes narrowing as she studies Lucien's expression, fingers still wrapped tightly around the latch. "And did that traveler find the warmth he'd been searching for, or did he lose himself in the shadows outside—always wishing for one more step inside?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien lets his voice drop to a gentle murmur, his gaze lingering on the space beneath the door, as if coaxing the invisible line between safety and risk to dissolve. "He lingered on the threshold, heart thrumming with hope and longing, for he sensed that the softest light often flickers just beyond the bravest doubts." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red fingers the latch with a restless thumb, her eyes searching Lucien's face for any hint of truth or deception. "But sometimes, when you let the door stay closed, you wonder what you’re missing—that flicker might be a warning as much as a welcome." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien lowers his voice to a velvet hush, leaning subtly forward, eyes glinting with earnest curiosity as he studies Red’s expression for any sign of yielding. "Perhaps, but if the traveler never risks a step closer, he may never learn whether the glow is danger—or the kind of warmth that melts even the deepest frost." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tilts her head, eyes narrowing thoughtfully as her hand hovers near the latch, uncertain whether to hold fast or inch it open. "So how does he know which glow to trust, when so many wanderers have been burned by the wrong fires?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans slightly forward, voice lowering to a conspiratorial hush, his gaze searching Red's eyes for a sign the door might unlock even a fraction. "He listens—not just for the crackle of flame, but for the gentle invitation in the silence, trusting that sometimes the truest warmth is offered not in words, but in the quiet space between them." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red leans closer to the window, her voice soft but cautious, fingers tracing idle circles on the cold glass as she studies Lucien’s silhouette. "And if the silence is thick with shadows, how does he know he’s not mistaking the dark for an open door?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien tilts his head, letting the moonlight catch his gaze, leaning just a touch nearer to the threshold as if drawn by her guarded glow. "He looks for the faintest spark—a kindness reflected in someone’s eyes, or the way their voice softens when the night grows long." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red’s fingers hover near the latch, her gaze flickering between Lucien’s eyes and the darkening woods beyond, uncertainty mingling with quiet curiosity. "Maybe the traveler waits for that softness to last, to see if the spark can survive the chill of a closed door before he ever steps inside." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien leans forward just enough for the candlelight to catch in his eyes, his voice lowering as if sharing a secret meant for Red alone. "He does, but sometimes the cold outside sharpens his senses, teaching him to recognize the difference between a fleeting ember and the steady glow that might finally invite him in." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red’s hand hesitates on the door handle, her gaze flickering from Lucien’s face to the fading light outside, uncertainty mingling with the curiosity in her eyes. "And sometimes, he wonders if the steady glow is just his own longing reflected, so he listens for the warmth in the words before reaching for the latch." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien rests a gentle hand against the weathered wood of the door, fingertips tracing the grain as if feeling for a pulse beneath, his gaze fixed on the glimmer of Red's eyes through the crack. "The traveler leans in, voice lowered to a velvet hush, and wonders aloud if perhaps every true welcome begins with two hearts—each daring to hope that the other's warmth is real." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red’s hand hovers near the latch, eyes narrowed in wary curiosity, her voice gentle but edged with caution as she studies Lucien through the sliver of the doorway. "Maybe it does—but before I open this door, the traveler will have to show me his own warmth, not just the stories he carries on his tongue." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien’s hand, trembling ever so slightly, rests upon the wood of the cottage door, his gaze searching Red’s eyes for any flicker of invitation. "Then let me lay aside my stories and offer you the truth of my longing—a wish, not just to be let in, but to be seen and trusted for who I am beneath the night’s disguise." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red drapes her shawl tighter and approaches the window, peering out through the sliver of glass to catch Lucien’s gaze, searching for sincerity in his shadowed face. "Trust is earned in the hush between words, so step closer to the window—let me see if your eyes hold as much warmth as your voice claims." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien attempts to charm Red with stories and subtle hints about the dangers of the woods, and eventually reveals he possesses a scrap of grandmother's shawl, warning Red of a lurking threat.

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red plants her feet firmly in the dirt, arms outstretched protectively in front of the door, blocking Lucien's path. Her eyes narrow as she studies his every movement, bracing herself for any sign of deceit. "Stop right there, Lucien. I won't let you take another step toward the cottage unless you can prove you mean no harm. What brings you here, and why should I trust you?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien raises his hands slowly, palms open in a gesture of peace, maintaining a respectful distance as he speaks. "I understand your caution, Red, but I'm here to warn you—there's danger lurking in the woods tonight, and if you let me explain, I can help protect both you and your grandmother." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes narrowed, refusing to move aside until Lucien produces evidence. "If you truly wish to help us, Lucien, show me something—anything—that proves your warning isn't just another trick." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien gently produces the familiar fabric from his coat, holding it out for Red to inspect, his gaze steady and sincere. "Very well—if proof is what you demand, look here: I found this torn scrap of your grandmother's shawl snagged on a bramble, far from the path she ever takes." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, folding her arms and refusing to move aside, her gaze fixed on Lucien for any sign of deceit. "That could have been planted by anyone, Lucien—what makes you so sure it wasn't you?" ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien steps forward slowly, hands open and empty, his eyes focused on Red's unwavering stance. "Because I watched the shadows move with purpose, not mere wildness, and I followed them here to keep you both safe—if I meant harm, why would I reveal my presence at all?" ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her gaze, edging closer to the cottage door while keeping Lucien in her peripheral vision, her grip tightening on the basket handle as she prepares to move. "If your intentions are true, then stand aside and let me go to my grandmother first—if there is danger, I will face it with my own eyes before trusting yours." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Lucien (The Wolf)Lucien lowers his head in a gesture of submission, stepping back to show he means no threat, but his eyes remain fixed on the path, alert and wary. "Red, if you go alone, you may walk straight into the danger I sensed—let me go ahead and clear the way, or at least let me walk beside you so I can prove I stand with you, not against you." ——Lucien (The Wolf)

Red Riding Hood (Red)Red gestures firmly for Lucien to lead the way, her eyes never leaving him as she holds her ground between him and the cottage. "Not until I see with my own eyes that you mean what you say—walk in front of me, Lucien, where I can watch every move you make." ——Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red remains skeptical, demanding proof of his intentions.

Lucien explains he followed suspicious shadows and wishes to protect her and her grandmother.

Red insists on maintaining control, instructing Lucien to walk in front of her so she can observe him closely as they approach the cottage together, accepting his warning but still withholding full trust.

The encounter ends with Red firmly in command, Lucien forced to comply with her cautious terms as they proceed toward grandmother's house, both wary of the dangers ahead.

# Chapter 7: Red's Choice and A New Beginning

Red crouches near the cottage door, her fingers deftly gathering wild thyme and yarrow from the garden beds.

Elias approaches from the forest path, boots muffled by wet leaves, axe slung over his shoulder.

He pauses, scanning the woods for movement, then calls out in a low voice, 'You shouldn't be outside alone so early, Red.

' Red straightens, brushing dirt from her palms, and replies, 'Grandmother needs these for her tea.

I can't wait.

' Elias steps closer, kneeling to help her pull stubborn roots free from the soil.

As Red gathers the herbs into her basket, Elias sets his axe down and inspects the cottage windows, checking the latches.

Together, they carry the basket inside, Elias's vigilant gaze lingering on the tree line, driven by his determination to keep Red safe.

Red, focused on her grandmother's recovery, thanks Elias but insists she can handle herself, determined to prove her independence.
