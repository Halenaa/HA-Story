Her mother, wiping flour from her hands, watches as Red carefully breaks the seal and unfolds the letter. Red reads aloud Grandmother's urgent request for help, her voice steady but filled with concern. Grandmother’s voice echoes in Red’s mind, expressing her loneliness and need for Red’s presence. Moved by her grandmother’s words, Red reassures her mother of her determination to help and her willingness to stay with Grandmother as long as needed. Her mother moves to close the door against the morning breeze, then rummages in a wooden cupboard for a jar of herbal salve, insisting Red bring it for Grandmother’s aching joints. Red promises not only to deliver the salve but also to ensure Grandmother uses it and to remain vigilant on her journey. She gathers her cloak and basket, reiterates her promise to heed her mother’s warnings about the forest, and receives a final reminder and embrace as she sets out on her journey.",

The updated plot now reflects these details while maintaining logical continuity."

Elias emerges from behind a thicket, axe slung across his shoulder, and blocks her path, eyes narrowed with concern. He glances at the basket, then the shadows between the trees. 'You shouldn't be this deep in the woods alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and direct, his motivation to protect her evident in his stance. Red sidesteps, lifting her chin. 'My grandmother needs these remedies, Elias. I won't let fear keep me back.' Elias shifts, studying the trail ahead, then steps forward to clear a branch from her way, his actions deliberate. 'Let me walk with you,' he offers, determined to prove his reliability. Red hesitates but nods, and the two proceed together, their footsteps muffled by the dense moss, as crows call overhead.",

Red hesitates, recalling her mother's warnings, and questions Lucien about his knowledge of the woods, engaging in a tense verbal exchange where she repeatedly presses for clarity and resists Lucien's vague answers. Lucien attempts to earn her trust with poetic hints about the forest, but Red stands firm, insisting on leading and demanding transparency. Lucien ultimately concedes, promising to warn her of any danger and agreeing to follow at a respectful distance.

Lucien grows increasingly curious and persistent, subtly admitting his interest in Red's safety and asking if she walks alone or expects to meet anyone. Grandmother, remaining protective and wise, offers ambiguous answers, refusing to give up any details that might endanger Red. The mood is tense but controlled, with both characters aware of the other's true nature and motivations.
