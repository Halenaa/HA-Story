        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue includes Grandmotherâ€™s voice directly responding to Red, which is not in the original plot summary (which only has Red reading the letter aloud, not a direct exchange). Additionally, Red explicitly promises to stay with Grandmother if needed and assures her mother multiple times of her caution, showing more verbal reassurance and initiative than the original plot. The updated plot now reflects these details while maintaining logical continuity.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue shows Red being more assertive and confrontational than originally described, pressing Lucien for direct answers and refusing to be led blindly. She insists on leading and sets clear boundaries, whereas the original plot has her merely brushing past Lucien and keeping her hand near a knife. The updated plot incorporates this stronger stance and more explicit negotiation of trust, reflecting the dynamic tension and Red's demand for agency.",

This is more direct and personal than the original plot, which focused on Lucien seeking the remedy's location under the guise of Red. The updated plot now incorporates Lucien's probing about Red and Grandmother's protective evasiveness, maintaining character logic and narrative tension.",

Instead, Elias focuses on asking about strangers, and Red is more pragmatic and collaborative about accepting his company rather than defensive. The updated plot removes the confrontation about Elias's whereabouts and his confession, shifting focus to mutual concern over strange presences in the forest and establishing a foundation of cooperation and trust between the two.",

Red is more nuanced in her skepticism, ultimately allowing Lucien to accompany her under strict conditions, rather than locking him out entirely. The original plot ended with Lucien retreating and Red alone unlocking the cottage door; the updated plot reflects Red's continued authority but now has Lucien walking ahead under her scrutiny, consistent with the dialogue's progression.",
