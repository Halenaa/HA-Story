Her mother, wiping flour from her hands, watches as Red carefully breaks the seal and unfolds the letter. Red reads aloud Grandmother's request for help, her voice steady. Her mother moves to close the door against the morning breeze, then rummages in a wooden cupboard for a jar of herbal salve, insisting Red bring it for Grandmother. Red nods, gathering her cloak and basket, determined to set out despite her mother's warnings about the forest. The exchange concludes with Red promising caution and her mother pressing the jar into her hands, setting Red on her journey.",

She scans the underbrush, alert for signs of danger as she pursues her mission to deliver medicine to her grandmother. Elias emerges from behind a thicket, axe slung across his shoulder, and blocks her path, eyes narrowed with concern. He glances at the basket, then the shadows between the trees. 'You shouldn't be this deep in the woods alone, Red,' he warns, voice low and direct, his motivation to protect her evident in his stance. Red sidesteps, lifting her chin. 'My grandmother needs these remedies, Elias. I won't let fear keep me back.' Elias shifts, studying the trail ahead, then steps forward to clear a branch from her way, his actions deliberate. 'Let me walk with you,' he offers, determined to prove his reliability. Red hesitates but nods, and the two proceed together, their footsteps muffled by the dense moss, as crows call overhead.",

Lucien, disguised as a traveler with a cloak pulled over his sharp eyes, emerges from behind a fallen log and offers to guide Red through a shortcut, his voice low and persuasive. Red hesitates, scanning the path ahead and questioning Lucien about his knowledge of the woods. Lucien gestures toward a narrow animal trail, describing its safety and his familiarity with its twists, all while subtly positioning himself closer to Red. Red accepts, but insists on leading, brushing past Lucien and keeping her hand near a pocketed knife. Lucien follows, observing her movements intently, his gaze flicking between Red and the deepening shadows, motivated by his desire to gain her trust and affection while concealing his true nature.",

He sets a basket of foraged berries on the oak table, glancing at the shelves lined with glass jars of dried roots and flowers. Grandmother, propped up on her patchwork quilt, squints suspiciously at Lucien, noting the stiffness in his movements. Lucien approaches the bedside, his tail hidden beneath the cloak, and pours a ladle of broth from the simmering kettle into a clay bowl, offering it to Grandmother with a persuasive smile. Grandmother, feigning trust, accepts the bowl but keeps her cane within arm's reach, tapping the wooden floorboard twice as a warning. Lucien leans closer, sniffing the air for traces of Red's usual lavender perfume, while Grandmother studies his hands, searching for signs of claws. Lucien asks in a low, coaxing voice about the location of her remedy, his ears straining for any sound outside that might signal Red’s approach. Grandmother, motivated to protect Red and test the imposter, deliberately gives vague directions, watching as Lucien prowls restlessly around the room, inspecting the medicine cabinet and sniffing at the herbal poultices.",

He grips the handle, scanning the underbrush, and says, 'You shouldn't walk alone, Red—the forest's grown restless.' Red deflects his concern by tightening her grip on the basket, stating she's bringing the apothecary's remedy to her grandmother. Elias steps forward, lowering his voice, and asks if she's seen any strangers. Red narrows her eyes, recalling a fleeting shadow earlier, and decides to press Elias about his recent absences, demanding, 'And where have you been, Elias? The village hasn't seen you for days.' The air is tense as a crow caws above, and Elias finally offers, 'I was tracking something dangerous—something that follows you.' Their conversation ends with Elias insisting on escorting her, and the two set off together, muddy boots squelching as they vanish deeper into the trees.",
