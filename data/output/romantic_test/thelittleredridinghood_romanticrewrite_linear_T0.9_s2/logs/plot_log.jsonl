She hands Red a woven basket filled with bread, a jar of honey, and a sealed envelope. The wax on the envelope bears a symbol Red doesn't recognize. Red tugs her red hood over her head and leans closer to examine the letter. Mother lowers her voice, saying, 'Deliver this to your grandmother—don't open it. She'll know what to do.' Red nods, her fingers tightening around the basket handle. She asks, 'Why the secrecy, Mother?' Mother glances out the window toward the shadowy line of the woods, her jaw set. 'There are things you aren't ready to know yet. Just promise you'll go straight there and back.' Red hesitates, then agrees, slipping the mysterious letter into her pocket. She opens the back door, the hinges creaking, and steps into the morning chill, the scent of dew and pine in the air. Mother watches her leave, arms folded, eyes narrowed in silent worry. The objective is for Red to deliver the basket and letter to Grandmother, setting her journey in motion."}}

Wolf, determined to reach Grandmother first, distracts Red by gesturing to a patch of rare flowers growing off the path, suggesting she gather some for Grandmother.
