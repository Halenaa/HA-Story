She hands Red a woven basket filled with bread, a jar of honey, and a sealed envelope. The wax on the envelope bears a symbol Red doesn't recognize. Red tugs her red hood over her head and leans closer to examine the letter. Mother lowers her voice, saying, 'Deliver this to your grandmother—don't open it. She'll know what to do.' Red nods, her fingers tightening around the basket handle. She asks, 'Why the secrecy, Mother?' Mother glances out the window toward the shadowy line of the woods, her jaw set. 'There are things you aren't ready to know yet. Just promise you'll go straight there and back.' Red hesitates, then agrees, slipping the mysterious letter into her pocket. She opens the back door, the hinges creaking, and steps into the morning chill, the scent of dew and pine in the air. Mother watches her leave, arms folded, eyes narrowed in silent worry. The objective is for Red to deliver the basket and letter to Grandmother, setting her journey in motion.",

Wolf emerges from behind a twisted birch, his fur slick from dew, tail flicking with calculated ease. He blocks Red’s path, tilting his head and sniffing the air, asking, 'You’re not just delivering sweets today, are you?' Red tightens her grip on the basket, steps sideways to maintain distance, and replies, 'I have a letter for Grandmother. Why does that concern you?' Wolf circles a fallen log, his ears pricked, and offers, 'Perhaps I can guide you—a shortcut, if you trust me.' Red scrutinizes Wolf, then decides to follow at a cautious pace, watching his every movement. The pair move deeper into shadows, branches creaking overhead, as Wolf subtly leads the way, intent on earning Red’s trust through helpfulness while Red remains vigilant, determined to reach Grandmother safely and uncover the letter’s secrets.",

He lowers his head politely, inquiring about her errand with a lilt in his voice, his nose twitching as he sniffs the bread and herbs in her basket. Red tightens her grip and sidesteps, studying Wolf's movements while asking pointed questions about his presence in this part of the woods. Wolf, determined to reach Grandmother first, distracts Red by gesturing to a patch of rare flowers growing off the path, suggesting she gather some for Grandmother. As Red bends to examine the flowers, Wolf slips away, paws barely making a sound on the damp moss, heading toward the cottage at a swift lope. The result: Red is momentarily delayed, while Wolf gains a head start toward Grandmother's house.",

Red points to a muddy pawprint smeared on the corner of the letter and questions Wolf sharply, demanding an explanation. Wolf, eager to prove his sincerity, drops to his haunches and digs through the wet leaves, producing a scrap of dark fur he claims matches the scent on the letter. As Red examines the fur, she asks pointed questions, forcing Wolf to recount his movements near the cottage. The scene concludes with Red pocketing the fur and letter, eyes narrowed, and instructing Wolf to accompany her inside to confront Grandmother together.",

Wolf tilts his head, then circles around her, paws leaving prints in the damp earth. 'I only wish to walk with you, Red,' he replies, voice smooth. 'Perhaps you’ll let me prove myself.' Red takes a deliberate step forward, forcing Wolf to retreat. Her motivation is to protect her grandmother and deliver the letter safely; Wolf’s is to gain Red’s trust and stay close to her. As Red pushes past, Wolf matches her pace, careful to keep a respectful distance, his tail low.
