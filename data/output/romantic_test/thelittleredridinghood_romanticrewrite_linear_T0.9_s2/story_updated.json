She hands Red a woven basket filled with bread, a jar of honey, and a sealed envelope. The wax on the envelope bears a symbol Red doesn't recognize. Red tugs her red hood over her head and leans closer to examine the letter. Mother lowers her voice, saying, 'Deliver this to your grandmother—don't open it. She'll know what to do.' Red nods, her fingers tightening around the basket handle. She asks, 'Why the secrecy, Mother?' Mother glances out the window toward the shadowy line of the woods, her jaw set. 'There are things you aren't ready to know yet. Just promise you'll go straight there and back.' Red hesitates, then agrees, slipping the mysterious letter into her pocket. She opens the back door, the hinges creaking, and steps into the morning chill, the scent of dew and pine in the air. Mother watches her leave, arms folded, eyes narrowed in silent worry. The objective is for Red to deliver the basket and letter to Grandmother, setting her journey in motion.",

Wolf emerges from behind a twisted birch, his fur slick from dew, tail flicking with calculated ease. He blocks Red’s path, greeting her with casual charm, remarking on the calming nature of the woods. Red responds warily, emphasizing the need for caution and vigilance, and keeps her distance, making it clear that trust must be earned. Wolf, picking up on her caution, offers to walk ahead so she can keep him in sight, suggesting his willingness to be helpful without being intrusive. Red agrees but remains vigilant, stating her intent to keep important matters close and handle things herself. The pair move deeper into shadows, branches creaking overhead, as Wolf subtly tries to prove his helpfulness by offering to clear the path or scout ahead, though Red insists on maintaining control of her mission. Despite Wolf’s attempts to build trust, Red is determined to reach Grandmother safely and uncover the letter’s secrets, relying on her own instincts while accepting Wolf’s company at arm’s length.",

The tension is palpable as Red makes it clear she does not trust Wolf and is determined to protect her grandmother. Despite this uneasy exchange, Wolf reverts to a friendly suggestion, pointing out a patch of wildflowers off the path and encouraging Red to pick some for her grandmother. Red, her suspicion momentarily softened by the idea of pleasing her grandmother, agrees and bends to gather the flowers. As she does, Wolf seizes the opportunity to quietly slip away, heading swiftly toward Grandmother’s cottage, gaining a head start while Red is delayed.

Wolf hovers nearby, his behavior more suspicious than before: when Red confronts him about muddy pawprints and torn edges on the letter, Wolf first tries to deflect, but under persistent questioning, he admits to sneaking around Grandmother's cottage in search of information about an old path and, possibly, food. Red discovers multiple pieces of evidence implicating Wolf—muddy pawprints, fur on the doorframe, a broken basket latch, crumbs, scratch marks, torn curtains, and a half-eaten loaf of bread. Wolf alternates between justifying his actions as accidents or innocent curiosity and revealing he is being chased by something dangerous, needing a way out of the woods. As Red pieces together the evidence, her trust in Wolf is severely tested, but she ultimately insists he accompany her inside to confront Grandmother and get to the bottom of the mounting suspicions and possible threats.

Wolf, surprised by her boldness, shifts from practiced nonchalance to genuine intrigue, remarking on her courage and offering companionship, not just out of calculation but also out of loneliness. Red remains cautious, expressing her urgency to protect her grandmother and fulfill her promise to Mother. She insists on keeping her distance, warns Wolf against cleverness, and stakes her claim to handling things at the cottage. Wolf, respecting her resolve, agrees to keep his distance and assures her he means no harm, acknowledging that they both have interests at the cottage but for different reasons. Their truce is uneasy, marked by Red’s vigilance and Wolf’s attempt to earn trust through honesty and restraint.

Wolf tilts his head, feigning ignorance, then offers to lead Red by a shortcut, brushing aside brambles with his paw.

Wolf, sensing her resolve, shifts his tone and confesses that, despite past misdeeds, he was also drawn by concern for Red and Grandmother. He presents a pouch of rare herbs, explaining that he obtained them from a mysterious friend beyond the ridge, a figure who is equal parts witch, healer, and enigma. Grandmother questions both the origins of the herbs and Wolf’s true motives, warning him that secrets can do harm if left to fester. As the rain intensifies, Red reads the cryptic letter aloud, revealing hints of a hidden family secret and warning to trust the lantern, not the path, and beware a smiling wolf. Red, unsettled, wonders aloud if there are secrets in the woods she’s never been told.

Additionally, Wolf provides a more detailed and evasive explanation about the origins of the herbs, referencing a mysterious friend, which adds nuance to his motivations and introduces a new possible character. Red is also more aggressive in her suspicion and defense of Grandmother. These changes deepen the mistrust and complexity between the characters, requiring the plot to reflect heightened suspicion, a slower path to trust, and the introduction of a potential new character (the friend beyond the ridge).
