# Chapter 1: Red Receives a Mysterious Invitation

Mother stands at the kitchen counter, slicing brown bread and wrapping it in a cloth, her hands moving quickly.

She hands Red a woven basket filled with bread, a jar of honey, and a sealed envelope.

The wax on the envelope bears a symbol Red doesn't recognize.

Red tugs her red hood over her head and leans closer to examine the letter.

Mother lowers her voice, saying, 'Deliver this to your grandmother—don't open it.

She'll know what to do.

' Red nods, her fingers tightening around the basket handle.

She asks, 'Why the secrecy, Mother?

' Mother glances out the window toward the shadowy line of the woods, her jaw set.

'There are things you aren't ready to know yet.

Just promise you'll go straight there and back.

' Red hesitates, then agrees, slipping the mysterious letter into her pocket.

She opens the back door, the hinges creaking, and steps into the morning chill, the scent of dew and pine in the air.

Mother watches her leave, arms folded, eyes narrowed in silent worry.

The objective is for Red to deliver the basket and letter to Grandmother, setting her journey in motion.

# Chapter 2: The Encounter with the Charming Stranger

Red, clutching her basket and the sealed letter, pauses to adjust the strap of her hood, scanning the dense underbrush for signs of movement.

Wolf emerges from behind a twisted birch, his fur slick from dew, tail flicking with calculated ease.

He blocks Red’s path, greeting her with casual charm, remarking on the calming nature of the woods.

Red responds warily, emphasizing the need for caution and vigilance, and keeps her distance, making it clear that trust must be earned.

Wolf, picking up on her caution, offers to walk ahead so she can keep him in sight, suggesting his willingness to be helpful without being intrusive.

Red agrees but remains vigilant, stating her intent to keep important matters close and handle things herself.

The pair move deeper into shadows, branches creaking overhead, as Wolf subtly tries to prove his helpfulness by offering to clear the path or scout ahead, though Red insists on maintaining control of her mission.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and keeps a careful distance, her basket clutched tightly in both hands as she matches Wolf’s pace, never letting him out of her sight. "You seem to know these woods rather well, Wolf. Mind if I ask where you're heading in such a hurry?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf glances back at Red with a relaxed smile, but his eyes flicker briefly toward the shadowed path ahead. "Oh, just wandering—no hurry at all, really; I find these woods calming, don't you?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances sideways at the Wolf, clutching her basket a bit tighter as she walks just far enough behind to keep him in view. "Calming, perhaps, unless one forgets what's lurking behind every tree." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf offers a toothy smile, glancing sideways at Red as if gauging her reaction. "Wolf: Well, it's important to keep one's eyes open, but I assure you, not every shadow hides a threat." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red subtly slows her steps, letting a few feet of space open between herself and the Wolf. "Still, I prefer to keep my distance—one can never be too careful with strangers in the forest." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf offers a toothy smile, his eyes glinting as he slows his pace to match Red's, watching her sidelong. "Of course, Red, caution is wise—though I hope in time you'll see I'm not the sort to bite." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red keeps her basket clutched tightly and lingers a few paces behind, never letting Wolf out of her sight. "Perhaps, but I've heard enough stories to know that trust is earned, not given." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf steps forward onto the path, glancing back with a disarming smile, while Red narrows her eyes and maintains her careful distance. "Wolf: Fair enough, Red—maybe you'll let me earn a bit of it by walking ahead, so you can keep your eyes on me." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red adjusts her basket, eyes narrowed, and follows several paces behind Wolf, her gaze fixed on his back. "Very well, but should you stray from the path, I'll know it's not just the shadows I need to watch." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Despite Wolf’s attempts to build trust, Red is determined to reach Grandmother safely and uncover the letter’s secrets, relying on her own instincts while accepting Wolf’s company at arm’s length.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket tightly, eyes darting between the winding trail and Wolf, her steps careful as she keeps just out of arm’s reach. "The woods feel darker today, don’t they? Every path looks the same, but I know which way to Grandmother’s house. I just have to keep my wits about me." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf pads ahead softly, brushing aside low branches, glancing back to gauge Red's reaction. "You have a keen sense of direction, Red—I could help clear the way if you like, make the journey a little easier." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, glancing sidelong at Wolf while scanning the undergrowth for movement. "Thank you, Wolf, but I’m used to finding my own path—though I suppose an extra pair of eyes couldn’t hurt, as long as we keep moving." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf steps lightly ahead, brushing aside a low-hanging branch, eyes glancing toward Red for any sign of trust or hesitation. "Of course, just let me know if you need anything—sometimes the shadows hide more than tangled roots." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on the basket, glancing sideways at Wolf while pressing forward along the crooked path. "I appreciate it, Wolf, but I’ll keep my eyes open too—there’s something important I must deliver to Grandmother, and I can’t afford any distractions." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf steps lightly ahead, glancing back to gauge Red’s reaction, ears pricked for any sign of her trust or hesitation. "I understand, Red—what you’re carrying must matter greatly, and I’d never want to slow you down; perhaps I could scout ahead for any trouble, just to be sure your path stays safe." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, eyes scanning the undergrowth as she steps carefully around a fallen branch. "That’s thoughtful of you, but I’d rather keep important things close at hand—besides, I need to see for myself that nothing’s amiss before I reach Grandmother." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 3: Wolf Arrives First and Makes His Move

Red carefully walks along the forest path, basket in hand, her senses alert to the sounds of the woods.

She notices fresh paw prints in the mud and soon encounters Wolf, who greets her with charm and a hint of curiosity.

Their conversation is notably more direct and charged than before: Red questions Wolf's motives, expresses suspicion, and challenges his presence in her territory, while Wolf parries with wit and subtle evasions.

The tension is palpable as Red makes it clear she does not trust Wolf and is determined to protect her grandmother.

Wolf lowers his head in a courtly bow, his eyes glinting with interest as his nose twitches toward the basket, inhaling the aroma with deliberate curiosity. "Good day, young miss. What brings you to these shadowed woods, with such a tempting basket in hand? The scent of fresh bread and wild herbs is enough to stir any appetite. Might you be delivering a treat to someone special?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs the basket to her chest, her eyes bright and trusting, though she glances at the wolf's keen nose with a hint of uncertainty. "Oh, good morning, sir—I'm bringing these to my grandmother, who lives just beyond the old oak grove; she hasn't been feeling well, so Mama packed her favorite bread and thyme." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf tilts his head, feigning concern, while his eyes linger a moment too long on the basket. "How thoughtful you are; is your grandmother often alone in that cozy cottage, or does she have other visitors to keep her company?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red smiles shyly, gripping her basket a little tighter as she glances down the path toward her grandmother's house. "It's usually just me who visits, sir—Grandmother likes her peace and quiet, though sometimes the birds and squirrels keep her company." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf tilts his head, his amber eyes glinting with keen interest as his tail flicks slowly behind him. "Such solitude must make your visits all the more cherished—do you go by the winding footpath or the sun-dappled shortcut through the birch thicket?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches her basket a little tighter, glancing at the dappled shadows between the trees as if weighing her mother's warning against the Wolf's gentle curiosity. "Mama says I must always take the winding footpath, no matter how tempting the shortcut might look—she says it's safer that way." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

WolfThe Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting with curiosity as his tail flicks, leaning in just a little closer to peer at the basket's contents. "How wise your Mama is—these woods can be full of surprises for those who stray from the path, though I confess the shortcut does sound ever so inviting, doesn't it?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hugs her basket a little closer and glances down the winding path, her cheeks flushed with earnestness. "Oh, I suppose it does look inviting sometimes, but I promised Mama I'd be careful—Grandmother would worry if I was late." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Despite this uneasy exchange, Wolf reverts to a friendly suggestion, pointing out a patch of wildflowers off the path and encouraging Red to pick some for her grandmother.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, steps sideways to keep a safe distance, and grips her basket tightly, never turning her back on Wolf. "You’re a long way from your usual haunts, Wolf. What brings you so deep into these woods today?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf offers a toothy smile, keeping his posture relaxed but his eyes sharp, watching Red's every move. "Oh, just wandering—these woods are peaceful if you know the right paths, don't you think?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and takes another measured step back, never turning her back to Wolf. "Peaceful, maybe, if you’re not stalking someone—so tell me, are you following me, or is this just a lucky encounter?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

WolfRed narrows her eyes, shifting her basket to her other hand as she circles slightly, keeping distance. "Why choose this particular trail, Wolf, when you know it's mine?" ——Wolf

Wolf tilts his head, offering a toothy smile while his eyes flicker to the basket Red clutches, gauging her reaction. "Now, why would I trouble myself with a path so well-guarded, unless it promised good company along the way?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, shifting her stance to keep a sturdy tree between herself and Wolf, never breaking eye contact. "Company or opportunity, Wolf? Because only one of us is walking these woods with a purpose, and I doubt it's just to chat." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf flashes a toothy, disarming smile, but his eyes flicker to the basket Red clutches protectively. "Oh, you wound me, Red—can't a creature enjoy a stroll without suspicion nipping at his heels?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, shifting her weight as she subtly positions herself between Wolf and the narrowest part of the trail. "Suspicion keeps me breathing, Wolf—so unless you have a reason better than idle wandering, you'd best pick your next words carefully." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

WolfRed narrows her eyes and shifts her weight, ready to move at the slightest provocation, her hand subtly inching toward the basket's handle. "If you’re not after trouble, then why do you keep circling closer instead of staying on your so-called peaceful path?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red plants her feet, eyes narrowing as she subtly shifts her basket behind her, readying herself for whatever comes next. "Because every step you take draws the shadows tighter, and I won’t let them swallow me without knowing what you’re hiding behind that sweet-talking snout." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf tilts his head just enough to catch the glint of Red’s eyes, his posture loose but his gaze sharp, testing her resolve. "If you’re so sure I’m hiding something, Red, perhaps it’s your own fears casting shapes in the dark—what is it you expect to find when you look at me so closely?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her gaze, shifting her stance to keep the path between them open, ready for whatever move Wolf makes next. "I expect to find the truth in your eyes, Wolf—because no matter how clever your tongue, it’s your hunger that always gives you away." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

WolfRed narrows her eyes and shifts her weight, ready to bolt or fight, watching Wolf for the slightest twitch of predatory intent. "And it's that hunger, not your words, that tells me whether to stand my ground or run—so which will it be, Wolf?" ——Wolf

Wolf shifts his weight, eyes flickering between Red and the thickening trees, as if calculating the distance to escape. "Perhaps it's wiser to walk away before curiosity turns to something less civil, Red." ——Wolf

Red, her suspicion momentarily softened by the idea of pleasing her grandmother, agrees and bends to gather the flowers.

Wolf gestures gracefully toward the cluster of rare flowers gleaming in the underbrush, his eyes glinting with calculated charm as he encourages Red to step away from the main trail. "My, what a thoughtful granddaughter you are, Red. You know, just there—off the path—a patch of the loveliest wildflowers is blooming. I imagine Grandmother would be delighted by a bouquet as bright as your smile. Wouldn't it be wonderful to surprise her with something extra special?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red glances eagerly toward the patch of wildflowers, already picturing the joy on her grandmother's face. "Oh, what a wonderful idea! Grandmother does love flowers, and I want to make her as happy as possible." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf settles down beside Red's basket, watching her step off the path toward the wildflowers, a sly grin curling on his lips. "Why not pick a few while the sun is high, Red? I'll keep an eye on your basket so nothing is lost." ——Wolf

As she does, Wolf seizes the opportunity to quietly slip away, heading swiftly toward Grandmother’s cottage, gaining a head start while Red is delayed.

The encounter leaves Red uneasy but focused on her mission.

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 4: Red Uncovers the Truth

Red kneels beside the mossy stone path, clutching the letter she suspects is not truly from her grandmother, and reads it aloud with a protective edge in her voice.

Wolf hovers nearby, his behavior more suspicious than before: when Red confronts him about muddy pawprints and torn edges on the letter, Wolf first tries to deflect, but under persistent questioning, he admits to sneaking around Grandmother's cottage in search of information about an old path and, possibly, food.

Red discovers multiple pieces of evidence implicating Wolf—muddy pawprints, fur on the doorframe, a broken basket latch, crumbs, scratch marks, torn curtains, and a half-eaten loaf of bread.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)I glance up from the letter, meeting Wolf’s gaze without flinching. My heart pounds, but I keep my voice calm, determined not to let him sense my worry. Wolf leans in, his nose twitching, as if hoping to sniff out some secret hidden in the words I read. "‘Dearest Grandmother,’ I begin, holding the letter tight so my hands don’t shake. ‘I’ll be bringing you fresh bread and honey, just as you like. Please keep the door locked until I arrive. With all my love, Red.’" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf's eyes narrow, his gaze fixed on the trembling edge of the letter, his tongue flicking over his teeth as he inhales deeply, searching for secrets masked by Red's bravado. "Such care in your words, Red—do you worry someone might visit before you do?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)I meet Wolf's eyes, forcing a small, unwavering smile, my grip on the letter tightening as I angle my body subtly between him and the path toward Grandmother's cottage. "Only that Grandmother should be safe until I’m there to look after her, no matter who passes through the woods." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf tilts his head, eyes glinting as he circles closer, the tip of his tail flicking with quiet anticipation. "Of course—but the woods have many shadows, and not all of them walk on four legs." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red meets Wolf’s gaze, forcing a small, steady smile, though her knuckles whiten around the letter. "That’s why I never stray from the path—so nothing in the shadows can follow me to her door." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf's lips curl in a thin, knowing smile as he leans closer, his gaze fixed on Red, searching for the flicker of fear behind her steady eyes. "And yet, sometimes what waits at the door comes from the path itself, not the shadows—don’t you think, Red?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)I meet Wolf's gaze, forcing my chin up, though my fingers press tighter to the letter, knuckles white against the paper. "If anything were to come from the path, it would find me standing between it and Grandmother, just as I promised." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf’s lips curl in a slow, toothy grin as he leans a fraction closer, eyes fixed on Red’s steady hands, searching for a tremor. "Promises are such fragile things—so easily broken if something hungrier comes knocking." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red meets Wolf’s gaze, her chin lifted and shoulders squared, though her knuckles whiten around the letter. "Then it will find me unbroken, no matter how sharp its teeth." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf alternates between justifying his actions as accidents or innocent curiosity and revealing he is being chased by something dangerous, needing a way out of the woods.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red holds the letter up between them, her finger pressed accusingly against the smudge, eyes narrowed in suspicion. "Wolf, how do you explain this muddy pawprint right here on Grandmother’s letter? Don’t try to tell me it’s nothing—I know your tracks when I see them. What were you really doing near her cottage?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts his weight uneasily, glancing away from Red's piercing gaze while brushing invisible dirt from his fur. "Red, you’re jumping to conclusions—maybe I passed by the cottage, but that doesn’t mean I tampered with her letter." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and holds the letter up to Wolf's nose, watching his reaction closely. "Then why is the mud still fresh, and why is the letter torn at the edge—what were you looking for inside, Wolf?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf’s eyes narrow defensively, his tail flicking with agitation as he steps back, glancing toward the forest as if weighing his next move. "Red, you act as though I’m some villain lurking in the woods—maybe I was curious, but I never meant any harm to your grandmother or her secrets." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, clutching the letter protectively while stepping closer, her voice sharp with accusation. "Curious enough to sneak around and leave your mark on her private things—what exactly were you hoping to find that you couldn't just ask us about, Wolf?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf's eyes narrow as he shifts his weight, tail twitching with barely concealed frustration. "Maybe I thought there was something in that letter about the old path through the woods—the one no one wants to talk about—and I needed to know if Grandmother was keeping it from me." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, clutching the torn letter tighter and taking a defiant step toward Wolf, her suspicion intensifying. "So you admit you were prying, Wolf—what do you want with the old path, and why should I trust anything you say when you’ve already lied about being near Grandmother’s cottage?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf’s ears flatten and his eyes dart nervously toward the dark trees, betraying fear that overrides his usual cunning. "You want honesty, Red? Fine—I need that path because there are things chasing me in these woods, things worse than a muddy pawprint, and if Grandmother knows a way out, I’ll do whatever it takes to find it." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands her ground, eyes narrowed, clutching the damaged letter tightly as she steps between Wolf and the cottage door. "If you’re so desperate, Wolf, why not ask for help instead of sneaking and tearing through secrets—what else aren’t you telling me?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf lowers his gaze, glancing nervously at the trees, his ears flicking back as if expecting something—or someone—to emerge from the shadows. "I can’t risk telling you everything, Red—some secrets are dangerous, even for you, and if you knew what was hunting me, you’d understand why I can’t trust anyone, not completely." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red folds the torn letter tightly in her fist, glaring at Wolf and stepping closer, daring him to deny her ultimatum. "Then prove it—show me what’s after you, or I’ll take this letter straight to Grandmother and let her decide what to do about your pawprints and your lies." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf’s ears flatten and his gaze flickers to the darkening woods, voice trembling just enough to betray genuine fear. "You want proof, Red? Step outside with me, and I’ll show you the claw marks on the tree—marks that aren’t mine." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red folds the torn letter tightly in her fist, eyes narrowed with suspicion, and steps warily toward the cottage door, ready to follow Wolf into the shadowy woods. "Fine, Wolf, but if this is another trick, you’ll regret ever setting foot near Grandmother’s door." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

As Red pieces together the evidence, her trust in Wolf is severely tested, but she ultimately insists he accompany her inside to confront Grandmother and get to the bottom of the mounting suspicions and possible threats.

Wolf crouches low, mud clinging to his fur, and extends the damp scrap toward Red, his eyes earnest and unwavering. "Look, Red—here. I know you don't have a reason to trust me, but I found this scrap buried right where the trail bends. Smell it for yourself—it matches the scent on that letter. Whoever sent it, it wasn't me. I'm trying to help you." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red holds the letter in one hand and the fur in the other, glancing between them and then back at Wolf, searching his face for any sign of deceit. "Red narrows her eyes, hesitating before leaning closer, her nose twitching as she compares the scent on the fur to the letter, her voice wary: 'If you're telling the truth, then who left this for me to find?'" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

WolfHe edges the scrap closer to Red, his paw trembling just enough to betray his anxiety. "Wolf's ears flatten as he meets Red's gaze, voice low and urgent: 'That's what I'm trying to figure out—someone's trying to set me up, and if we don't work together, they'll get away with it.'" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)She steps back slightly, testing the weight of her suspicion against the evidence before her. "Red glances from the fur to Wolf, her fingers tightening around the letter as doubt flickers in her eyes: 'And what if working with you is exactly what the real culprit wants?'" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf pushes the fur scrap a little closer between them, his tail still and eyes searching Red's face for any sign of trust. "If that were true, wouldn't I have just disappeared into the trees instead of handing you the only proof that could clear my name?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)She lifts the fur to her nose, inhaling deeply as she watches Wolf for any sign of deception. "Red studies Wolf for a long moment, then finally reaches out to take the scrap of fur, voice cautious but softer: 'This doesn't prove everything, but… it's a start.'" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The chapter ends with Red and Wolf entering the cottage together, tensions high, both wary of the other's motives and the real danger lurking in the woods.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red holds up the bits of fur between her fingers, fixing Wolf with a sharp, unwavering gaze as she waits for his answer. "Wolf, I couldn't help but notice some tufts of fur caught in the doorframe. They look an awful lot like yours. Would you care to explain what you were doing around Grandmother's cottage earlier today?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing toward the cottage as if searching for an excuse. "Well, Red, I was just passing by on my morning walk—those woods get chilly, so maybe I brushed against the door without realizing." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, holding up a tuft of fur for emphasis, watching Wolf's reaction closely. "Funny, because Grandmother mentioned hearing footsteps and a low growl right before she locked up—are you sure you were only passing by?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts his weight uneasily, glancing at the fur in Red's hand. "Perhaps the wind carried my voice, Red, or maybe Grandmother mistook the rustle of branches for a growl—it’s easy to imagine things in the quiet woods." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and holds up a handkerchief dappled with fresh mud, waiting for Wolf's response. "Is that so? Then why did I find muddy paw prints leading straight to her doorstep—prints that match yours exactly?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing at Red’s stern expression while unconsciously brushing dirt from his paws. "Red, I can see how that looks suspicious, but I stopped only to sniff at a basket someone left outside—curiosity, nothing more." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, stepping closer to Wolf and holding up the basket's damaged latch for him to see. "Interesting—because the basket was untouched when I arrived, yet the latch was broken, as if someone tried to force it open." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts his weight uneasily, glancing toward the woods as if searching for an escape. "Red, maybe the latch was already weak—sometimes these old baskets fall apart with the slightest nudge, especially in damp weather." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and holds up the delicate hair between her fingers, watching Wolf's reaction closely. "Then why, Wolf, did I find a single grey hair snagged on the broken latch—one that matches the fur on your tail?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing away from Red's piercing gaze, his ears flicking back in discomfort. "Red, perhaps my tail brushed the latch as I leaned in to sniff, but I swear I didn't touch what was inside." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, holding up the grey hair and the broken latch for Wolf to see, her stance firm and unwavering. "If that's true, Wolf, then you won't mind telling me exactly what you were searching for outside Grandmother's cottage at dawn." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf glances away, avoiding Red's piercing gaze, his tail twitching nervously behind him. "Red, I was searching for the scent of fresh bread—your Grandmother's baking always fills the air, and I couldn't resist following it to her doorstep." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and holds up the crumb-speckled pawprint, watching Wolf's reaction closely. "Is that so, Wolf? Then explain why there were crumbs leading away from the basket, and why I found your pawprint pressed right into the middle of one." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing down at his paws, his ears flicking back in discomfort as Red narrows her eyes, studying his every move. "Red, I must have stepped on a crumb without noticing in my eagerness to leave once I realized I was too close to the cottage." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes and holds up the basket for emphasis, watching Wolf's reaction closely. "Yet the crumbs trailed all the way to the window, Wolf—were you planning to peek inside, or was there something else you hoped to find?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts his weight uneasily, glancing away from Red and nervously flicking his tail. "Red, I only wanted to catch a glimpse of Grandmother to wish her good morning—nothing more sinister than a friendly neighborly visit." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, stepping closer to Wolf and holding up a splinter from the window frame that matches the color of his claws. "Friendly, Wolf? Then why did Grandmother find scratch marks beneath the window sill, as if someone was trying to pry it open?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uncomfortably, glancing away as his tail flicks with nervous energy. "Red, I suppose my claws might have slipped when I leaned on the sill—old wood can be slippery, and I lost my footing trying to get a better view." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, clutching the torn curtain fragment in her hand as she steps closer to Wolf, watching his reaction intently. "Convenient, Wolf, but if your intentions were so innocent, why did Grandmother find her curtains torn, as though someone with sharp claws had tried to claw their way inside?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts uneasily, glancing away and nervously smoothing his tail. "Red, perhaps my claws snagged the curtain by accident as I stumbled, but I assure you, I never meant to damage anything." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red fixes Wolf with a piercing stare, holding up the partially eaten loaf as evidence, daring him to contradict her. "If it was all just an accident, Wolf, then why did Grandmother discover a half-eaten loaf of bread under the window—still warm, with your teeth marks clear as day?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 5: A Choice of the Heart

Red steps confidently over mossy roots, clutching the basket and the folded letter, her boots squelching in the mud.

Wolf, emerging from behind a birch, greets her with wary curiosity rather than blocking her path.

Their exchange is charged—Red stands her ground, unafraid, and asserts her right to the path, making it clear she’s not easily intimidated.

Wolf, surprised by her boldness, shifts from practiced nonchalance to genuine intrigue, remarking on her courage and offering companionship, not just out of calculation but also out of loneliness.

Red remains cautious, expressing her urgency to protect her grandmother and fulfill her promise to Mother.

She insists on keeping her distance, warns Wolf against cleverness, and stakes her claim to handling things at the cottage.

Wolf narrows his eyes, pausing mid-circle to fix his gaze on her, tail held high in silent warning. "You walk in my territory, yet your scent is unfamiliar. What brings you to these woods, stranger?" ——Wolf

Wolf, respecting her resolve, agrees to keep his distance and assures her he means no harm, acknowledging that they both have interests at the cottage but for different reasons.

Their truce is uneasy, marked by Red’s vigilance and Wolf’s attempt to earn trust through honesty and restraint.

Together, they proceed toward Grandmother’s cottage, each watchful of the other, with Red ever-protective and Wolf seeking genuine connection, the forest around them echoing with the tension of newfound respect.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, her eyes fixed on Wolf, and steps forward with purpose, watching as Wolf instinctively takes a step back. "You know, Wolf, I used to be afraid every time you showed your teeth. But not anymore. This path belongs to me just as much as it does to you." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf's eyes narrow, his grin faltering as he instinctively takes another step back, unsettled by Red's unwavering stance. "Careful now, Red—bravery can be dangerous in these woods." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red plants her feet firmly, staring the Wolf down with unwavering eyes. "Dangerous, yes—but only to those who underestimate me." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf's ears flatten and his tail lowers, giving ground as Red stands her ground, eyes unwavering. "Is that so? Well, I must admit, your boldness is. unexpected." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red squares her shoulders, her eyes unwavering as Wolf takes another cautious step back, uncertainty flickering across his face. "You'd be wise to remember, Wolf, that even the smallest flame can set the forest ablaze." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

----------------------------------------

# Chapter 6: The Act of Devotion

Red adjusts the strap of her basket and pauses beside a mossy log, inspecting a muddy paw print embedded in the path.

Wolf emerges from behind an alder tree, his tail flicking with calculated nonchalance as he circles closer.

Red grips the basket handle tighter and steps back, her eyes narrowing as she scans his approach.

Wolf lowers his voice and flicks his ears, suggesting they travel together for 'safety from lesser predators,' while he sniffs the air for traces of Grandmother's scent.

Wolf lowers his voice, ears flicking attentively. He sniffs the air, nostrils flaring subtly as he searches for Grandmother's scent, all while keeping his gaze fixed on his companion, a sly smile curling on his lips. "You know, these woods aren't as friendly as they seem. Danger lurks behind every shadow—foxes, wild dogs, creatures with less wit than sense. Perhaps we should travel together. Two are far safer than one, wouldn't you agree?" ——Wolf

Red kneels, scraping a sample of the paw print into a kerchief, and questions Wolf about his knowledge of the mysterious letter.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red kneels beside the fresh paw print, carefully scraping some soil into her kerchief, eyes narrowed as she rises and fixes Wolf with a probing look. "Wolf, this print matches the one by Grandmother's door—and now this letter turns up, too. Care to explain how your paws keep crossing my path?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf shifts his weight, eyes flicking between Red's kerchief and the letter, lips curling in a guarded smile. "Perhaps you're seeing paw prints where you want to, Red—letters appear for many, not just for wolves." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red folds the kerchief with the sample tightly, her gaze sharp and unyielding on Wolf, waiting for any flicker of guilt or truth. "Convenient answer, Wolf, but you always seem to be one step ahead of my questions—almost as if you know what I’ll find before I do." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf narrows his eyes, shifting his weight and subtly concealing his forepaw behind a tangle of undergrowth. "Curiosity is a dangerous scent to follow, Red—sometimes it leads you straight into the jaws of the unknown." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands, her grip tightening around the kerchief as she fixes Wolf with an unwavering stare. "Maybe, but I’m not the one leaving tracks where secrets shouldn’t tread—so unless you want to be the next clue I uncover, tell me what you know about this letter." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf narrows his eyes, shifting his weight as if ready to bolt, glancing at the letter with an unreadable expression. "If I were hiding secrets, Red, I’d make sure my prints vanished long before you arrived." ——Wolf

Wolf tilts his head, feigning ignorance, then offers to lead Red by a shortcut, brushing aside brambles with his paw.

Wolf tilts his head, a sly smile curling his lips, as he gently pushes aside a cluster of thorny branches with his large paw, revealing a shadowy trail winding deeper into the forest. "Oh, dear child, you look quite lost among these tangled woods. Are you sure you know the way? Perhaps I could help—there’s a little-known path just beyond these brambles. Much quicker to Grandmother’s house, I assure you." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitates, clutching her basket tightly, eyeing the dark thicket where the Wolf gestures, curiosity and caution warring on her face. "Oh, really? I’ve always taken the long path, but if you say it’s quicker…" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf flashes a reassuring grin, gently sweeping aside thorny branches with an elegant paw, beckoning Red forward. "Trust me, my dear, I know every secret of these woods—follow close and you'll be at Grandmother's door before you know it." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hesitantly steps forward, clutching her basket tighter as she peers into the shadowy shortcut. "Well, I suppose it would be nice to surprise Grandmother by arriving early—lead the way, Mr. Wolf." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red hesitates, tempted by the offer and briefly considers surprising her Grandmother by arriving early, but ultimately shakes her head and insists on staying to the main path, refusing Wolf's offer and making it clear she is watching him closely.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, clutching her basket tightly as she keeps a careful distance from Wolf, her posture guarded and alert. "No, thank you, Wolf. I'll stick to the main path just like Mama told me. I know these woods well enough, and I'm not interested in shortcuts." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf tilts his head, giving her a sly smile, but his eyes linger on her basket as he slowly steps aside, feigning politeness. "Suit yourself, Red, but not all dangers are so easily spotted from the main path." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red tightens her grip on her basket, meeting Wolf's gaze without flinching. "Maybe, but I trust my own eyes more than any shortcut you suggest." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

The two continue forward, tension mounting as Wolf trots at her side, occasionally glancing at the kerchief in her hand.

# Chapter 7: Return and Revelations

Red, still dripping from the rain, confronts Wolf with suspicion as she places the mysterious letter on the table.

Wolf, lingering in the doorway, initially dodges Red’s question about why he followed her, admitting only to curiosity and hunger.

Red presses him, refusing to accept vague answers and threatening to defend her grandmother if necessary.

Wolf, sensing her resolve, shifts his tone and confesses that, despite past misdeeds, he was also drawn by concern for Red and Grandmother.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red steps forward, placing herself protectively between Grandmother and Wolf, her red cloak flaring as she fixes the Wolf with a determined gaze. "You need to tell me, Wolf—why did you follow me all the way through the woods? I won't let you harm my grandmother. Speak now, and tell us your true intentions." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf steps back, eyes flickering between Red and Grandmother, feigning innocence but keeping his body tense, ready for Red's response. "Wolf (with a sly tilt of his head): Oh, Red, I merely wanted to see where such a brave little girl was hurrying off to in such a hurry—surely there's no harm in curiosity, is there?" ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red narrows her eyes, stepping protectively in front of Grandmother, fists clenched and unwavering. "Curiosity doesn't make you lurk behind trees and sneak into people's homes, Wolf—tell the truth, or you'll have to answer to me." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Wolf steps back, glancing between Red and Grandmother, weighing his options as the tension thickens. "Wolf (eyes narrowing, voice low): Very well, Red—if you must know, I was hungry, but now I see it's your courage that's truly worth following." ——Wolf

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red stands tall between Grandmother and Wolf, her eyes unwavering as she prepares to defend them both. "Your hunger doesn't give you the right to threaten my family, Wolf, and if you value your life, you'll leave us in peace." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

He presents a pouch of rare herbs, explaining that he obtained them from a mysterious friend beyond the ridge, a figure who is equal parts witch, healer, and enigma.

Wolf lowers his head, tail flicking anxiously, and gently places the small pouch of wild herbs on the ground in front of Red, his eyes earnest and vulnerable. "I know I've given you reason to worry before, but truly, my heart was pulled here by concern for you and Grandmother. I couldn't bear the thought of harm coming your way. These herbs—I've gathered them myself from deep in the woods. They soothe pains and calm fevers. Please, accept them as a sign I mean no harm. I want to mend what’s broken between us." ——Wolf

Grandmother questions both the origins of the herbs and Wolf’s true motives, warning him that secrets can do harm if left to fester.

Grandmother leans forward, her gaze unwavering, fingers drumming impatiently on the table as she waits for Wolf's explanation. "Hmm. these aren't the sort of herbs you find in our woods, Wolf. Tell me—where did you come by them, and why do you have them at all?" ——Grandmother

Wolf offers a sly smile, carefully keeping his gaze steady on Grandmother while subtly tucking the pouch of herbs deeper into his cloak. "Ah, Grandmother, let's just say I have my ways—and some secrets are better left untold." ——Wolf

Grandmother leans forward, her gnarled hand hovering protectively over the herbs, her gaze fixed unblinking on Wolf. "Secrets, you say? Well, secrets tend to fester if left in the dark, Wolf—so you'd best start talking if you want any supper from my table." ——Grandmother

Wolf shifts his weight uneasily, glancing toward the shuttered window as if expecting someone—or something—to be listening. "If I must, Grandmother—let's just say a friend from beyond the ridge owed me a favor, and these herbs were her payment." ——Wolf

Grandmother leans forward, her gnarled fingers drumming impatient rhythms on the wooden table as she fixes Wolf with a piercing stare. "A friend beyond the ridge, you say? And what sort of friend trades in such rare things—witch, healer, or something else entirely?" ——Grandmother

Wolf meets Grandmother's gaze evenly, lips curling in a faint, guarded smile. "Let's just say she's a bit of all three, Grandmother, and she doesn't deal with just anyone." ——Wolf

Grandmother leans forward, her gaze sharp and unblinking, hands tightening around her mug as if bracing for an unwelcome revelation. "Well, then, Wolf, you'd best hope her intentions are as pure as her wares—or have you brought more than just herbs into my home tonight?" ——Grandmother

As the rain intensifies, Red reads the cryptic letter aloud, revealing hints of a hidden family secret and warning to trust the lantern, not the path, and beware a smiling wolf.

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red furrows her brow, clutching the letter tighter as she glances nervously at the rain-streaked window, her mind racing with questions and worry. "Let's see what this says. 'To the one who wears the crimson hood—within the roots where shadows dwell, a truth once buried now awaits the light. Trust the lantern, not the path, and beware the wolf that wears a smile.' What does that even mean? A secret—hidden in the roots? Lantern? Wolf? Why would someone send me this?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches the letter tighter, glancing nervously toward the rain-streaked window as thunder rumbles. "Is this about Grandma, or is there something in the woods I was never told about?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red clutches the letter tighter, glancing nervously at the darkening window as thunder rumbles outside. "But if there really is something hidden out there, how am I supposed to find it—and what if the wolf is already watching me?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Red, unsettled, wonders aloud if there are secrets in the woods she’s never been told.

Grandmother stands tall, clutching the letter close to her chest, her eyes sweeping from Red to Wolf. The firelight flickers over Wolf’s quietly offered herbs, casting uneasy shadows as the tension lingers, but a fragile thread of cooperation now shimmers between them. "Enough of secrets and suspicion! If we mean to untangle this mess, we must do it together—no more hiding, no more blaming. The truth won’t reveal itself while we bicker. Wolf, your herbs on my hearth show a willingness; let us all match it. Whatever this letter holds, we face it as one." ——Grandmother

WolfHe steps back from the hearth, meeting each person's gaze in turn, inviting their agreement. "Wolf nods, voice low but steady: 'Then let the truth be shared, and let none of us stand alone in its light.'" ——Wolf

Grandmother, seeing the rising tension, insists they must work together to uncover the truth, acknowledging Wolf’s gesture of trust in placing the herbs on the hearth.

The scene ends with all three united in a fragile truce, resolved to face the mystery—and their suspicions—together.

# Chapter 8: A New Beginning

Red stoops to wipe mud from her boots on the welcome mat, balancing the wicker basket and clutching the folded letter.

Grandmother unlatches the heavy oak door, peering out with narrowed eyes and beckoning Red inside.

Red hands over the letter while scanning the room for unfamiliar objects, her curiosity piqued by a faint musky scent lingering near the fireplace.

Grandmother, motivated to protect herself and Red, slides the latch closed and examines the letter's seal, running her thumb across the wax.

She instructs Red to fetch her spectacles from the mantel, determined to read the letter for clues about its sender.

Grandmother gestures urgently toward the mantel, her eyes fixed on the unopened letter, determination clear in her voice. "Red, dear, would you be so kind as to fetch my spectacles from the mantel? I must read this letter straightaway—there may be something important within." ——Grandmother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red moves swiftly to the mantel, scanning for Grandmother's spectacles. "Of course, Grandmother—I'll get them right away; who do you think the letter is from?" ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Grandmother waits anxiously as Red crosses to the mantel to retrieve the spectacles. "I'm not certain, child, but there's something peculiar about the handwriting—I must see it clearly to be sure." ——Grandmother

Little Red Riding Hood (Red)Red hands Grandmother the spectacles and leans in, her eyes fixed curiously on the letter. "Here are your spectacles, Grandmother—let's take a closer look together and see if we can figure out who sent it." ——Little Red Riding Hood (Red)

Grandmother settles her spectacles on her nose, unfolds the letter carefully, and holds it up to the window's sunlight, inviting Red to peer over her shoulder. "Thank you, my dear—now, let us hold the letter to the light and see what secrets its words might reveal." ——Grandmother

The objective is for Grandmother to decipher the letter while ensuring the cottage is secure;

the result is heightened vigilance and the beginning of their investigation.
