The updated plot reflects this more mutual negotiation of boundaries, emphasizing Red's caution and autonomy, and Wolf's subtler attempts to earn trust, rather than immediately leading the way himself.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue makes Wolf's actions far more suspicious and implicates him in a series of minor break-ins and thefts at Grandmother's cottage, which is not present in the original plot summary. The original plot had Wolf eager to prove innocence, but the dialogue shows him caught in multiple lies, repeatedly justifying physical evidence against him. The updated plot incorporates these behaviors and Red's heightened suspicion, while still maintaining the forward momentum toward confronting Grandmother together.",

Wolf is more open about his loneliness and desire for company, not just calculating to gain trust. Their interaction is less about Wolf physically blocking Red and more about a verbal sparring and negotiation of trust and boundaries. The updated plot incorporates these nuances, maintaining character motivations and the truce, but reflects their increased candor and mutual respect.",

        "plot_change_note": "The dialogue reveals that Wolf initially tries to deflect with charm and admits to hunger before acknowledging his concern for Red and Grandmother, which is a shift from the original plotâ€™s immediate admission of concern. Additionally, Wolf provides a more detailed and evasive explanation about the origins of the herbs, referencing a mysterious friend, which adds nuance to his motivations and introduces a new possible character. Red is also more aggressive in her suspicion and defense of Grandmother. These changes deepen the mistrust and complexity between the characters, requiring the plot to reflect heightened suspicion, a slower path to trust, and the introduction of a potential new character (the friend beyond the ridge). The core direction remains, but the emotional beats and character dynamics are more tense and layered than in the original.",
