        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting horror arrival",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited, past tense, closely following Red’s perceptions as she arrives at the cabin. Establish Red as unfamiliar with the current situation and ensure readers meet her for the first time, with any references to her past or relationships kept implicit. Build suspense by focusing on sensory details and Red’s growing unease.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with a brief atmospheric prologue or a cold open, describing the chilling scene as Red approaches the cabin alone. No prior narrative needed—treat this as the reader’s initial entry point."

        "narrative_role": "Climax of first confrontation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, maintaining Red’s viewpoint. Let the reader experience Red’s confusion and rising terror as she interacts with the disguised wolf, with no prior knowledge of her or the wolf’s history. Show her suspicion building through dialogue and internal monologue.",
        "transition_hint": "Directly link to the previous chapter’s final image—Red entering the cabin—by following her as she moves from the hallway to the bedroom, heightening suspense."

        "narrative_role": "First woodland encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited, past tense, staying with Red as she recalls her earlier journey through the woods. This chapter should be clearly introduced as a flashback, triggered by a sensory or emotional memory (e.g., Red’s fear or the wolf’s attack in the previous scene). Establish the initial tension between Red and the wolf, showing their unfamiliarity and the wolf’s predatory cunning.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin with Red, in the aftermath of the confrontation, flashing back to her journey—perhaps as she catches her breath and tries to piece together how she ended up in this situation."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, focusing on Red’s perspective as she receives her mother’s instructions. Clearly mark this as a deeper flashback within the previous memory, possibly triggered by Red’s recollection of her mother’s warnings. Show Red’s concern for her grandmother and her motivation to undertake the journey.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition smoothly by having Red, in the flashback of the forest, remember her mother’s voice or a specific warning—then fade into the actual scene at home."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited, past tense, with Red as she experiences mounting terror in the woods, immediately after leaving her mother. Sequence events to follow her journey and build suspense through her reactions to the environment and sense of being watched.",
        "transition_hint": "Return from the flashback to the forest timeline (after Red leaves home); use a sensory echo (e.g., sound of snapping twigs) to ground the reader back in the woods."

        "narrative_role": "Antagonist's preparation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, but shift limited focus briefly to the wolf while maintaining distance—showing only what Red could infer later (e.g., evidence left behind, noises heard). Depict the wolf’s entry into the cabin and the subduing of grandmother as a parallel action, possibly as Red nears the cabin, building dramatic irony.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition via a cutaway: as Red approaches the cabin or senses danger, shift to the wolf’s actions, using a clear narrative break or a line like 'Meanwhile, inside the cabin…'"

        "transition_hint": "Resume immediately from the previous chapter’s climax (wolf revealed, Red escapes bedroom), keeping the action continuous and urgent."
