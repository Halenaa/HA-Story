        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting confrontation, emotional reveal",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited (Red's perspective), past tense. Begin with Red and the Wolf's confrontation, ensuring the reader understands this is their apparent first major interaction. Carefully seed hints about their personalities and motivations, but avoid assuming reader familiarity with their backstory. Let grandmother's intervention subtly introduce their deeper feelings, without explicit prior romantic context.",
        "transition_hint": "Open in medias res with sensory/emotional cues (Red’s pounding heart, Wolf’s nervous glances), then allow the confrontation to unfold. After the chapter, gently prompt a transition into Red’s memory of how she got here."

        "transition_hint": "Transition using a clear flashback marker: e.g., 'Just hours earlier, as Red set out through the woods…' or by having Red recall the moment when she first saw the Wolf."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited (Red’s perspective), past tense. Show Red receiving the letter and deciding to set out. Highlight her motivations and independence. Avoid references to the Wolf; focus on family and the looming journey.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a seamless memory trigger from Chapter 2 (e.g., as Red makes the deal, she recalls her mother’s warnings)."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited (Red’s perspective, but when Red is absent, focus on Wolf’s observable actions from an external point of view, never entering Wolf’s thoughts). Past tense. Describe the Wolf’s arrival at the cottage and his interaction with Grandmother as Red would imagine or later learn it.",

Let her reactions reflect the newness of their relationship, with annoyance and curiosity. Grandmother’s role should be supportive and lightly teasing.",
