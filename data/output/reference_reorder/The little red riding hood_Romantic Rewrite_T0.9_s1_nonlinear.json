        "narrative_instruction": "Open the novel in third person limited, past tense, focusing on Red’s perceptions as she and Elias confront 'Grandmother' (Lucien in disguise). Since this is the reader’s first encounter with the characters, introduce Red, Elias, and Lucien with clear, vivid physical and emotional details. Subtly imply their connections through dialogue and body language, but avoid referencing previous shared experiences. Present Lucien’s confession and Grandmother’s secret as dramatic revelations, planting intrigue for backstory to be explored in later chapters.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin in medias res, with sensory details (smells, tension in the air) drawing the reader directly into the confrontation. End the chapter with Red reeling from Lucien’s confession, gazing at a letter she pulls from her basket—this letter acts as a segue to the next chapter."
