        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting mystery, opening hook",
        "narrative_instruction": "Begin the novel in third person limited, past tense, from Red's perspective. Introduce Red as she arrives at her grandmother’s pod, with no prior character introductions or context. Ensure Red’s reactions and observations convey unfamiliarity with current events—she is startled and uncertain, discovering her grandmother’s absence and the security breach for the first time. Carefully withhold any references to previous events or known antagonists; Red’s suspicion of Cyberwolf is based solely on the evidence she uncovers in this scene.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with a cold start: Red approaches the breached pod. Use sensory details and questions in Red’s mind to set up the mystery and draw readers in. No reference to past events, as this is the reader’s first encounter with the world."

        "narrative_role": "Antagonist introduction, rising tension",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, from Red’s perspective. Use a flashback structure: transition from Red’s discovery of the breach (Chapter 4) to her recollection of the earlier ambush by Cyberwolf. Maintain Red’s emotional continuity—she connects the present crisis to her recent, dangerous encounter. Present Cyberwolf as a new threat to both Red and the reader, ensuring their first meeting in the narrative.",
        "transition_hint": "After Red finds evidence of forced entry and the scrambled message, have her reflect on how the situation spiraled—cue a direct memory or sensory trigger (e.g., she touches her damaged bike or sees a scratch, leading into the flashback of the ambush). Use a clear, natural segue such as: 'It hadn’t been long since she’d last felt this hunted...'"

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, from Red’s point of view. Use a deeper flashback/interpolation: as Red recalls the ambush, have her mind drift further back to the origin of her mission—the assignment from Ms. Weaver. Characterize Red’s motivations and the stakes for her grandmother, filling in emotional and logistical context for the reader.",
        "transition_hint": "From the aftermath of the ambush flashback, use Red’s internal thoughts (e.g., questioning why she ever accepted the mission or missing the safety of the city) to slide into the memory of receiving the mission. Use a transition phrase such as, 'It all started hours ago, when the city lights still glowed and danger felt far away...'"

Return to sequential narrative: after establishing the mission’s origin, narrate Red’s departure and her tense crossing of the Outlands checkpoint. Progress events logically from the mission’s assignment, maintaining narrative continuity.",
        "transition_hint": "After the flashback of receiving the mission, transition directly to Red’s journey—use narrative connective tissue such as, 'With the vial secure, Red set out across the city’s edge, nerves steeled for what lay beyond the checkpoint...'"

Return to the ‘present’ timeline established at the novel’s opening (Chapter 4), continuing events after the trap is set. Character relationships and knowledge must reflect the culmination of previous chapters—Red is now familiar with Cyberwolf’s threat and motivated by her grandmother’s danger.",
        "transition_hint": "End Chapter 2 with a brief return to the pod’s present timeline, then seamlessly continue into Chapter 5 as Cyberwolf enters the scene. Use a phrase like, 'Now, as the pod’s doors hissed open, the threat Red had feared became real...'"
