        "title": "The Suspicious Reunion",
        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting horror confrontation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited perspective focused on Red. Present tense for immediacy, but allow for subtle hints of uncertainty. Red arrives at Grandma's house for the 'first time'—no prior knowledge of the Wolf or what happened before. All character introductions must be fresh to the reader, with Red's reactions genuine and unprepared. Build suspense through Red's growing unease.",
        "transition_hint": "Open in medias res with Red's arrival at the ominous, ajar door. After the chapter's climax (the Wolf's attack), transition to the next chapter via a jarring, fragmentary memory or sensory cue (Red’s blurred vision, a scream, or a falling object) that triggers a flashback."

        "narrative_role": "Villain’s secret setup",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, now shifting focus to the Wolf as the viewpoint character. Use past tense to distinguish the flashback. Depict the Wolf’s infiltration of Grandma’s house and maintain tension, giving insight into the Wolf's deception but not breaking into omniscient or external viewpoints.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin with a sensory or narrative cue from the previous chapter (e.g., the sound of the Wolf’s voice, a smell in the house) that dissolves into the Wolf’s memory or perspective, signaling a shift back in time."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Establishing the normal world",
        "narrative_instruction": "Return to third person limited, focusing on Red’s perspective. Use past tense—this is a continuation of the flashback sequence. Offer a normal, almost mundane world before horror, establishing Red’s independence and her relationship with her mother. Characters interact as if nothing has yet happened.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a visual or sensory motif from the Wolf’s infiltration (e.g., the basket, the forest path) as a link, dissolving to Red preparing to leave home."

        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "First encounter with danger",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, focusing on Red. Past tense continues as the mainline flashback. Show Red’s innocence and the Wolf’s duplicity. Build unease but keep character relationships as fresh, with Red meeting the Wolf for the first time.",
        "transition_hint": "Segue directly from Red’s departure, using the continuity of her journey and her thoughts about her mother’s warnings to introduce the encounter in the woods."

        "new_order": 5,
        "narrative_role": "Crossing into danger",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, Red’s perspective. Past tense, as this is still within the flashback chain. Emphasize Red’s internal conflict and her decision to break the rules. The Wolf is present only as a lurking presence, not in direct interaction.",
        "transition_hint": "Move seamlessly from the woods encounter; Red’s thoughts and the Wolf’s suggestion prompt her to take the forbidden path, maintaining narrative momentum."

        "narrative_role": "Climax: rescue and confrontation",
        "narrative_instruction": "Resume third person limited, now back to Red’s immediate perspective in the present timeline. Past tense for narrative consistency. Reflect Red’s confusion and fear from the attack, then shift to her perception of the huntsman’s dramatic entrance and the ensuing struggle.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a sensory jolt (Red’s scream, the Wolf’s attack) as a narrative bridge from the flashback sequence back to the present moment, making the transition feel like Red’s panicked recollection snapping into the now."

        "chapter_id": "Chapter 7",

        "new_order": 7,
        "narrative_role": "Resolution and aftermath",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, Red’s perspective. Past tense. Depict the emotional aftermath—Red’s shaken state, her reunion with her mother, and the family’s resolve. All relationships should naturally progress from the events just experienced.",
        "transition_hint": "Follow the calming after the climax, using physical and emotional cues (the hush after violence, Red’s trembling hands) to ease into the denouement."
