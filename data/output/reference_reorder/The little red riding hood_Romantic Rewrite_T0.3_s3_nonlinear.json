        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Action Encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person omniscient perspective throughout, past tense. Introduce Red as she arrives at Grandmother's house, noticing something amiss. Characters must display unfamiliarity: Red should not recognize Wolfe immediately; Wolfe should act as if this is their first direct confrontation in this setting. Establish the mood and setting, hinting at missing backstory, which will be revealed in a later flashback.",
        "transition_hint": "Open in medias res: begin with Red entering the cottage, sensing strangeness. Leave subtle curiosity for how she got there and who Wolfe is."

        "narrative_role": "Romantic Forest Encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue using third person omniscient, past tense. This chapter acts as a flashback to explain Red and Wolfe's first meeting and their flirtatious exchange. Carefully reveal their initial chemistry but avoid indicating knowledge of future events. Maintain character emotional state as naïve and curious.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition with a flashback device: after Red's suspicions in Chapter 4, shift with a line such as 'Earlier that day, as Red made her way through the forest...' to cue the reader."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person omniscient, past tense. Pick up directly from the previous flashback, showing Wolfe's plan to outpace Red and involve Grandmother in the ruse. Keep character actions consistent with their developing relationship: playful, ambiguous trust.",
        "transition_hint": "Seamlessly follow the events of Chapter 2, using a connective sentence such as 'As Red lingered among the wildflowers, Wolfe seized his chance...'"

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue with third person omniscient, past tense. Reveal Red's motivations and her mother's warning for taking the forest path. Frame this chapter as a deeper flashback, interpolated to provide background context after the main action has begun. Ensure readers understand Red's curiosity but do not foreshadow her later interactions with Wolfe.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition with a reflective device: after Chapter 3, cue the reader with a phrase like 'To understand Red's decision, one must look back to the morning...' before narrating her conversation with her mother."

        "transition_hint": "Transition with a direct continuation: after the emotional peak of Chapter 4, Grandmother emerges, prompting a shift from tension to humor and warmth."
