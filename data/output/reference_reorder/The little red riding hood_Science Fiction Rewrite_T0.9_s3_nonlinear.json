        "narrative_role": "Inciting action opener",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open the novel in third person limited perspective, past tense, tightly focused on Red’s experience as she breaks into the dome for the showdown. Establish Red as unfamiliar to the reader and avoid references to prior events. Show her perception of the Wolf Unit and her grandmother as if for the first time. Drip in only essential context for clarity, withholding backstory for later chapters.",
        "transition_hint": "After the climax of the dome escape and rescue, transition to a reflective, destabilized moment for Red (e.g., catching her breath, looking at the quantum drive), which can naturally prompt a flashback to how she got here."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited (Red), past tense, but relay Wolf Unit actions via Red’s indirect awareness (e.g., receiving hints about interference or observing colony disruptions). Avoid direct Wolf Unit POV, but allow omniscient narration for external events only as Red perceives or learns about them.",
