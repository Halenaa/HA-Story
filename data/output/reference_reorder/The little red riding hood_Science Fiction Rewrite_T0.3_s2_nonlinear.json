        "narrative_instruction": "Write in third person limited, past tense, tightly following Red's perspective as she arrives at the breached outpost. As this is the reader's first contact with Red, Wolf Unit-9, and Grandma Hood, ensure their relationships are established organically through Red's immediate perceptions and reactions. Do not assume prior reader knowledge of mission context or character backgrounds.",
        "transition_hint": "Open in medias res: begin with Red skidding to a halt at the outpost, alarmed by the breached door, and immediately introduce the tension and confusion. Use Red’s internal observations to seed questions about who she is and why she’s there."

Clearly signal a shift to flashback—either by a direct memory trigger (e.g., Red recalling how she got here) or a narrative cue. Depict Red receiving the mission from her mother, Dr. Hood, without referencing events from Chapter 5. Use this to establish Red’s motivation, her technical skills, and the looming threat of rogue androids.",
