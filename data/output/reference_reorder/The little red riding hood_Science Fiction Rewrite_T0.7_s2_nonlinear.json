        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting action, standoff",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open in third person limited, present tense to create immediacy. Introduce Red and Wolf as unfamiliar to the reader and to each other. Avoid internal thoughts from Wolf; focus on Red’s perceptions and reactions. Carefully withhold detailed backstory, presenting only what Red knows in the moment. Build tension through sensory and action details, hinting at the significance of the nanomedicine and the urgency without full context.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin in medias res: use brief, disorienting sensory cues (alarms, darkness, rapid movement) to plunge the reader into the confrontation, then allow Red’s scattered thoughts or observations to ground the scene."

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Mission setup, background",
        "narrative_instruction": "Remain in third person limited, present tense. Transition smoothly from the aftermath of the bunker standoff to Red’s earlier life, using a flashback signaled through sensory or emotional triggers (e.g., Red’s memory of her mother’s warning as she faces Wolf). Clearly establish Red’s family, motivations, and the mission parameters. Avoid knowledge of the bunker showdown.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a memory or sensory trigger (e.g., Red’s hand on the nanomedicine during the standoff) to spiral back to her mother giving her the delivery task."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Villain’s move, raising stakes",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, present tense, but shift focus to Grandmother’s perspective, maintaining internal consistency by only revealing what Grandmother knows and perceives. Use an interpolation method: integrate this sequence as a parallel thread, possibly through Red’s worries or her mother’s warnings echoing in her mind, hinting that danger is approaching Grandmother.",
        "transition_hint": "Segue from Red’s preparation for the journey to Grandmother’s isolated situation, perhaps through Red’s concern or a line of dialogue that passes the narrative focus."

        "narrative_role": "Crossing threshold, enemy introduced",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, present tense, from Red’s perspective. Present Red’s encounter with Officer Wolf as their first meeting, with Red unaware of Wolf’s true intentions. Subtly connect to the earlier (flashforward) confrontation by echoing Wolf’s mannerisms or Red’s unease. Emphasize Red’s tension and subterfuge.",
        "transition_hint": "Return to Red’s journey after Grandmother’s scene; use the passage through city limits as a narrative bridge."

        "narrative_instruction": "Stay in third person limited, present tense, focused on Red. Show her technical skills and resourcefulness when attacked by the drones. Highlight her growing awareness of being hunted and her determination to reach Grandmother. Build on the tension established with Wolf.",
        "transition_hint": "Follow Red directly from the checkpoint, using the transition from city environment to the biotech forest as a scene change."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited, present tense. Red receives Grandmother’s warning, intensifying her resolve. Show her emotional response and decision-making, reinforcing the stakes. Tie her choices back to motivations introduced in Chapter 1 (her promise and family bonds).",
        "transition_hint": "Use Red’s escape from the drone ambush as the lead-in; she receives the coded message at a moment of relative safety, prompting her decision."

Resolve the core conflict and highlight the consequences for Red and Grandmother. Avoid introducing new perspectives or knowledge unknown to Red.",
        "transition_hint": "Directly follow the prior escape from the bunker, with Red administering the nanomedicine and immediately reacting to the government enforcers’ approach."
