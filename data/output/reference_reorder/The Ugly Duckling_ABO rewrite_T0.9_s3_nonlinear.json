        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Opening revelation, catalyst",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open the novel in third person limited, past tense, centered on the ugly duckling’s internal experience as he approaches the swans. Depict his exhaustion and resignation, ensuring the reader feels his unfamiliarity with the swans and their world. Do not reference earlier events or relationships beyond his own confusion and longing for acceptance. Avoid introducing names or specific details that have not yet been established.",
        "transition_hint": "At the chapter’s end, as the duckling sees his reflection and realizes he is a swan, allow his wonder and disbelief to trigger a memory, naturally leading into a flashback sequence about his origins."

        "narrative_role": "Origin/backstory establishment",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, now focusing on the ugly duckling’s earliest memories. Describe his hatching and first interactions with the brood mother and siblings, maintaining a sense of discovery and confusion from the duckling’s perspective. Carefully introduce family dynamics and the initial ostracism without assuming prior knowledge from the reader or the characters.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin with ‘He remembered...’ or a similar device, seamlessly moving from the present moment of self-reflection to the memory of hatching."

        "narrative_role": "Early hardship, outsider encounters",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, following the ugly duckling’s perspective as he seeks shelter in the barn. Clearly depict his unfamiliarity with the cat and hen, and their suspicion of him as an outsider. Use brief, natural references to his earlier rejection without assuming the reader knows all details yet.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition from the memory of family rejection to his search for shelter (‘After leaving the pond, he wandered...’), smoothly interpolating this episode as the next remembered hardship."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, focused tightly on the ugly duckling’s emotional state during the confrontation with the alpha duckling and his subsequent decision to flee. Reference previous experiences only as fleeting emotions (e.g., ‘He had never felt more unwanted’), not as explicit narrative events.",
        "transition_hint": "Segue from the barn exile by having the duckling recall another incident of rejection, or show him returning to the pond in hopes of acceptance, only to trigger the next memory."

        "narrative_instruction": "Keep third person limited, past tense, focusing on the ugly duckling’s struggle to survive winter and his near capture. Highlight his sense of isolation and despair, using internal monologue to connect his physical hardship to prior emotional wounds, but do not reference future events.",
        "transition_hint": "Use the harshness of winter, both literal and metaphorical, as a bridge from the last memory; for example, ‘With the coming of winter, his loneliness grew sharper...’"

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, centering on the ugly duckling’s attempt to find belonging with the geese, only to be rejected and endangered. Emphasize his desperation to connect and the repeated pattern of exclusion, without presaging his future transformation.",
        "transition_hint": "Move from his escape into the snow to his next attempt at finding kin, perhaps referencing his growing sense of hopelessness (‘He found himself among strangers once more...’). End with a sense of unresolved longing that naturally loops back to the opening scene of the swan encounter."
