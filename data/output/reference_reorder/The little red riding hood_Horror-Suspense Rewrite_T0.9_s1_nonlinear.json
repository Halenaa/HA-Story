        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Immediate Horror Introduction",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open with a tense, visceral scene using third person limited perspective focused on Red. Employ past tense, and ensure character introductions are clear—Red must be unfamiliar to the reader, as this is their first encounter with her. Describe her actions and emotional state as she faces the wolf, but do not reference prior events from her life or relationships yet.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin in medias res, with a sensory cue (e.g., sound of the wolf at the door) to immediately immerse the reader. Conclude the chapter with Red freeing her grandmother, then shift to a quieter, reflective moment to signal a move to the past."

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Initial Suspenseful Encounter",
        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, centering on Red's experiences and perceptions. Shift to past tense as a flashback, signposted by Red's recollections or a narrative pause indicating a return to earlier events. Carefully establish Red's relationship with the wolf as a stranger and maintain her lack of awareness of his true identity.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a transitional phrase such as ‘Earlier that day...’ or a sensory trigger (Red's memory of the wolf's eyes) to smoothly move from the previous intense scene into this prior event."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Discovery and Rising Tension",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited perspective focused on Red. Use past tense, and continue the flashback/interpolation mode. Red’s concern should escalate naturally from the previous chapter’s events, with her recognition and relationship to Grandmother clear but not yet affected by the traumatic events of Chapter 6.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition from the narrative of Red's journey to her arrival at the house, perhaps with a line about her anticipation or residual unease from the earlier meeting."

        "new_order": 4,
        "narrative_role": "Backstory and Motivation Establishment",
        "narrative_instruction": "Third person limited perspective remains on Red. Use past tense for direct narrative, and present this chapter as a deeper flashback, providing context for Red’s journey and her relationship with her mother. Avoid referencing future events or Red’s experiences in the woods.",
        "transition_hint": "Use a reflective narrative bridge, such as Red recalling her mother’s warning as she enters the house, to tie the past with the immediate present."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, but now shift focus to the wolf’s perspective for variety within the unified POV. Use past tense and ensure character relationships are properly contextualized (the wolf and Grandmother do not know Red is near). Do not reference events that have not yet occurred in narrative time.",
        "transition_hint": "Move from Red’s concern for her grandmother to the wolf’s preparations via a narrative pivot, such as describing what’s happening inside the house as Red approaches."

        "narrative_role": "Trap and Immediate Threat",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, returning focus to Red as she interacts with the disguised wolf. Use past tense, and portray character relationships as strained and suspicious, in line with narrative progression. Red’s familiarity with Grandmother must clash with the wolf’s impersonation.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition smoothly by ending the previous chapter with the wolf’s preparations and beginning this chapter with Red’s cautious entry and questioning."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited, focusing on Red and Grandmother’s coordinated escape. Past tense, with heightened emotional stakes and action. Ensure their relationship reflects increased trust and desperation, based on recent shared trauma.",
        "transition_hint": "Direct continuation, using the chaos of the previous struggle to propel the action forward without pause."

        "narrative_role": "Resolution and Aftermath",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited perspective, centering on Red’s emotional response and her interaction with Grandmother and the woodsman. Use past tense, and ensure closure in character arcs—Red’s innocence is tempered by experience, Grandmother’s gratitude is explicit.",
        "transition_hint": "Move seamlessly from the escape scene to the arrival of the woodsman, using sounds or sensory cues (shouts, footsteps) to signal help arriving."
