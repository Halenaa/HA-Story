Characters (Red, Wolf-9, Grandmother) must be introduced as if meeting the reader for the first time; avoid any assumed prior knowledge or familiarity. Clearly establish Red's motivations, Wolf-9's ambiguous allegiance, and Grandmother's expertise. Do not reference prior events; allow character relationships to emerge naturally.",
