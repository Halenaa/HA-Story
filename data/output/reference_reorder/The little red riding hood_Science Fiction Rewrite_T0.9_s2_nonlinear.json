        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting In Media Res Conflict",
        "narrative_instruction": "Open with third person limited perspective centered on Red, present tense for immediacy. Introduce Red and Wolf during a tense standoff in the Quarantine Zone, but ensure that their interactions reflect unfamiliarity—neither recognizes the other from previous events. Withhold detailed backstory, instead focusing on the immediate stakes and atmosphere. Use subtle cues (Red’s internal thoughts, Wolf’s mechanical behaviors) to hint at their motivations without full exposition.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin abruptly with sensory details and tension, then, at the end of the chapter, let Red’s internal focus settle on what led her to this moment, signaling a narrative shift into the past."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited perspective, switching to past tense to clearly mark the flashback. Present Red’s ordinary world and motivation: the urgent call to deliver nanobots to her grandmother. Build her relationship with her mother and the sense of risk. Show her determination, but do not reference her future confrontation with Wolf.",
        "transition_hint": "Use Red’s recollection or a narrative anchor phrase such as, 'It all started earlier that day…', to smoothly shift from present conflict to past events."

        "narrative_instruction": "Remain in third person limited, past tense. Present Red’s arrival at her grandmother’s unit and the disguised Wolf. Red should be cautious, but not suspect Wolf explicitly until biometric evidence reveals the truth. Their relationship should reflect only what has happened so far (one encounter).",

        "transition_hint": "Use Red’s urgency after exposure of Wolf’s deception to segue into her need for a new route, then move into the checkpoint sequence."
