        "narrative_instruction": "Use third person limited perspective, past tense. Introduce Red and her grandmother as if the reader is meeting them for the first time. Avoid assuming any prior knowledge or emotional investment; describe their fear and barricading with vivid, sensory detail, establishing the core threat and their desperate relationship. Present Red's courage and the grandmother's support as an immediate, urgent dynamic.",

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited perspective, past tense. Provide context for Red's journey, her concern for her grandmother, and her mother's strict warning. Frame this chapter as a flashback triggered by a sensory detail (e.g., Red's memory of her mother's voice in the previous chapter's chaos), ensuring the reader understands these relationships are foundational and have not been previously established.",

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, but briefly shift focus to the Wolf’s actions (still filtered through a limited perspective, avoid omniscient leaps). Present the Wolf as a shadowy, malevolent presence. Frame the chapter as a parallel thread, perhaps intercut with Red's journey, to maintain suspense and show the Wolf’s cunning.",
