        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Suspicion, Opening Scene",
        "narrative_instruction": "Narrate in third person limited, past tense, closely following Red’s perceptions and inner fears. Establish Red as unfamiliar with the danger but acutely aware of unease. Characters (Red, 'Grandmother'/Wolf) must be introduced as if the reader is meeting them for the first time. Withhold any prior knowledge of the wolf’s identity; Red only suspects strangeness, not the truth.",
        "transition_hint": "Begin with an atmospheric, suspenseful entry: describe Red arriving at the cottage, the unsettling quiet, and the small, ominous details she notices. As this is the first chapter, no transition from prior text is required."

        "new_order": 2,
        "narrative_role": "Wolf's Preparations, Backstory Reveal",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, shifting the lens to follow the Wolf’s actions and point of view, but do not reveal information Red could not plausibly know in detail. Narration must keep the reader in suspense, revealing only what Red might later learn or suspect. Present the wolf’s intrusion as a flashback, prompted by Red’s suspicions in the previous chapter.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition via Red’s growing unease: as she notices something amiss, interpolate a flashback triggered by a detail (e.g., muddy paw prints) to reveal how the situation at the cottage unfolded before her arrival."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited, past tense, tightly following Red’s perspective. Narrate her journey through the forest and her first meeting with the Wolf. Red should treat the Wolf as a stranger; the growing tension should be felt through her cautious optimism and naivety.",
        "transition_hint": "Return from the flashback to the past with a clear narrative cue: e.g., 'Earlier that day, as Red made her way through the woods…' Continue sequentially."

        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited, past tense, focused on Red’s thoughts and feelings as she receives her mother’s warning. Emphasize the danger of the woods and Red’s internal conflict. Narrate Red’s family relationships and the initial sense of threat.",
        "transition_hint": "Seamlessly move from the forest to Red’s memory of leaving home, using a reflective thought or a sensory trigger (e.g., the scent of the basket’s contents) to shift back to the morning’s conversation."

        "narrative_instruction": "Using third person limited, past tense, continue to focus on Red’s internal debate and her response to the Wolf’s suggestion of a shortcut. Show her reasoning process and the tension between obedience and desire.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition naturally from the mother’s warning to Red’s decision in the forest, using her recollection of her mother’s words as she faces the Wolf’s tempting proposal."

        "narrative_instruction": "Remain in third person limited, past tense, tightly focused on Red’s immediate perceptions and reactions during the confrontation. Build suspense through sensory detail and Red’s mounting terror. The Wolf’s true nature is revealed only as Red discovers it.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition from Red’s exploration of the cottage (from Chapter 5’s opening) and her memory of the past (Chapters 2-3-1-4) back to the present, as she uncovers evidence and faces the disguised Wolf."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited, past tense, describing the action from Red’s limited viewpoint. Capture her terror, relief, and gratitude as the huntsman intervenes. Reactions should be filtered through Red’s emotional state and physical vulnerability.",
        "transition_hint": "Move directly from the climax: as Red struggles with the Wolf, the huntsman’s entrance bursts into the scene, maintaining momentum."
