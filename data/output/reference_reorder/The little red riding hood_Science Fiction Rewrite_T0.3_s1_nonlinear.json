        "new_order": 1,
        "narrative_role": "Inciting Incident, In Media Res",
        "narrative_instruction": "Begin the novel with a third person limited perspective (focused on Red) in past tense, dropping the reader directly into the high-stakes confrontation in the AI core. Introduce Red and Grandmother as a team with urgent purpose, but avoid explicit exposition of their relationship—let their dialogue and actions hint at their connection. Introduce Wolfe as an antagonistic force, unfamiliar with Red. Carefully seed subtle references to events and relationships that will be clarified later through flashbacks.",
        "transition_hint": "Conclude the chapter with Wolfe demanding answers from Red, then use Red's anxiety and memory triggers as a springboard to transition into her recollection of how she arrived at this moment."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue in third person limited (Red's perspective), past tense, presenting this chapter as Red's recollection prompted by the crisis in the AI core. Establish Red's relationship with her mother and grandmother, her sense of duty, and her motivations. Carefully layer in details that clarify the urgency and stakes introduced in Chapter 5, but do not reveal knowledge Red could only have gained later.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with a line such as 'Just hours earlier...' or use Red's inner monologue to trigger the recollection, smoothly signaling the start of a flashback."

        "new_order": 3,
        "narrative_role": "Rising Action, Exposition Bridge",
        "narrative_instruction": "Maintain third person limited (Red), past tense. Present this as a direct continuation of the previous flashback, depicting Red's reunion with Grandmother and introducing urgency via Wolfe's approach. Ensure the chapter reveals Grandmother's role and the virus threat, but remains consistent with what Red knows at this point in the timeline.",
        "transition_hint": "Transition directly from Red arriving in the restricted sector to her entering the lab, maintaining chronological continuity within the flashback."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited (Red), past tense. Resume direct chronological narrative as Red tries to evade security. Wolfe is introduced as an obstacle, with no prior personal connection to Red—he suspects her but doesn't know her yet. Maintain a sense of suspense about Red's mission.",
        "transition_hint": "Segue from the evacuation in Grandmother's lab to Red approaching the checkpoint, using urgency and environmental cues (alarms, lockdown warnings) for a seamless flow."

        "narrative_instruction": "Continue third person limited (Red), past tense. Chronologically follow Red as she navigates the sabotaged corridor, with Wolfe in pursuit. Depict both Red's ingenuity and Wolfe's determination, but keep their relationship adversarial and newly-formed.",
        "transition_hint": "Use immediate consequences of the checkpoint escape (alarms, pursuit) to drive Red into the sabotaged corridor, creating a continuous narrative thread."
