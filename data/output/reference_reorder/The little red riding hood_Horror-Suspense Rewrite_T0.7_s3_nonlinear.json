        "narrative_instruction": "Begin the novel with a third person limited perspective (Red as focal character) in present tense. Introduce Red as she faces 'Grandmother,' quickly revealing the wolf's true identity. Establish characters as strangers to the reader, avoiding prior knowledge of their relationships. Tension should be palpable, with sensory details and immediate action.",
        "transition_hint": "Open with a scene of chaos and confrontation, then use Red's inner turmoil and confusion to naturally lead into a flashback of earlier events."

Seamlessly integrate this information as a flashback or memory prompted by Red's actions in the woods.",

        "narrative_instruction": "Remain in third person limited, past tense. Present the huntsman's warning and his gifting of the silver whistle to Red. Given the large position shift, carefully anchor this interaction as a remembered or referenced moment, possibly as Red recalls the whistle's origin during her confrontation.",
