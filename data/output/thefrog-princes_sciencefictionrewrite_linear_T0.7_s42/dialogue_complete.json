Marcus, clipboard in hand, paces behind her, glancing anxiously at the timer counting down and the security camera in the corner. Lila adjusts the settings, wipes condensation from the tank's glass, and signals Marcus to prepare the sedative syringes. As the machine hums to life, Marcus hesitates, voice low: 'Are you sure we should push the sequence, Dr. Tran? Feld said not without his sign-off.' Lila snaps the lid shut on the gene chamber, determined: 'We can't wait—if this works, we can save months of trial time.' Marcus reluctantly injects the sedatives into the frog tanks, his hands trembling. The chamber lights flicker, and a sudden alarm blares as the DNA sequence destabilizes, causing the water in the tanks to froth violently. Lila grabs a fire extinguisher, while Marcus scrambles to shut down the system. The experiment fails: the two frogs inside begin to morph, their limbs stretching, skin bubbling. Lila issues orders: 'Get the secondary containment ready—NOW.' Marcus stumbles backward, knocking over a tray of surgical instruments as the transformation continues uncontrollably.",

Croal tugs at Lila’s sleeve with a low croak, whispering, 'Too bright, too many eyes—go back to the water.' Marcus, lagging behind, anxiously checks his phone for messages from Dr. Feld, then edges closer to Lila, whispering, 'If Feld finds us here, we’re finished.' Lila shakes her head, uncaps a vial, and instructs Ribbick, 'If you want a choice, you have to get past them.' Ribbick nods and darts to the parapet, using his powerful legs to leap onto an air duct, scanning the alley below for escape. Croal hesitates, glancing back at the roof access door as Security Chief’s voice barks, 'Fan out, nothing leaves this roof!' The group splits: Lila and Marcus crawl toward the opposite side, while Ribbick prepares to leap, Croal gripping his arm. The arrival of the security team forces their hand—Ribbick vaults over the parapet, Croal following in a shaky arc, as Lila and Marcus duck behind electrical boxes. The standoff ends with the mutants escaping into the darkness, Lila and Marcus trapped but unseen, and Security Chief ordering a sweep.

To maintain consistency, the plot now includes this negotiation phase, the involvement of Dr. Feld before the experiment, and a more deliberate decision-making process leading up to the failed gene-splicing event.",
