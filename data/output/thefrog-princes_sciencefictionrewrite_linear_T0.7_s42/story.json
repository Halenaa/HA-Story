        "plot": "Dr. Lila Tran stands at a console, fingers flying across the touchscreen as she initiates the final gene-splicing sequence. Marcus, clipboard in hand, paces behind her, glancing anxiously at the timer counting down and the security camera in the corner. Lila adjusts the settings, wipes condensation from the tank's glass, and signals Marcus to prepare the sedative syringes. As the machine hums to life, Marcus hesitates, voice low: 'Are you sure we should push the sequence, Dr. Tran? Feld said not without his sign-off.' Lila snaps the lid shut on the gene chamber, determined: 'We can't wait—if this works, we can save months of trial time.' Marcus reluctantly injects the sedatives into the frog tanks, his hands trembling. The chamber lights flicker, and a sudden alarm blares as the DNA sequence destabilizes, causing the water in the tanks to froth violently. Lila grabs a fire extinguisher, while Marcus scrambles to shut down the system. The experiment fails: the two frogs inside begin to morph, their limbs stretching, skin bubbling. Lila issues orders: 'Get the secondary containment ready—NOW.' Marcus stumbles backward, knocking over a tray of surgical instruments as the transformation continues uncontrollably.",

Red warning lights blink along the perimeter, reflecting off puddles. Far below, the city hums with distant traffic. The rooftop is cluttered with HVAC units, antennae, and a low parapet wall. Searchlights sweep across the gravelly surface, accompanied by the static crackle of walkie-talkies and the clipped footsteps of security boots.",

With steady hands, she signals to Ribbick and Croal, who flatten themselves against the shadowed wall, their webbed fingers splayed wide on damp concrete. Ribbick’s throat pulses as he scans the gap between vents, his eyes fixing on a distant door where Security Chief and two guards emerge, flashlights sweeping. Croal tugs at Lila’s sleeve with a low croak, whispering, 'Too bright, too many eyes—go back to the water.' Marcus, lagging behind, anxiously checks his phone for messages from Dr. Feld, then edges closer to Lila, whispering, 'If Feld finds us here, we’re finished.' Lila shakes her head, uncaps a vial, and instructs Ribbick, 'If you want a choice, you have to get past them.' Ribbick nods and darts to the parapet, using his powerful legs to leap onto an air duct, scanning the alley below for escape. Croal hesitates, glancing back at the roof access door as Security Chief’s voice barks, 'Fan out, nothing leaves this roof!' The group splits: Lila and Marcus crawl toward the opposite side, while Ribbick prepares to leap, Croal gripping his arm. The arrival of the security team forces their hand—Ribbick vaults over the parapet, Croal following in a shaky arc, as Lila and Marcus duck behind electrical boxes. The standoff ends with the mutants escaping into the darkness, Lila and Marcus trapped but unseen, and Security Chief ordering a sweep. The rooftop is left slick with rain, echoing with the fading slap of webbed feet and the distant wail of sirens.",

She scans the alley, her breath visible in the cold air, and waves the two mutated frog-princes forward. Ribbick, his newly webbed fingers twitching, crouches low and listens intently to the human city noises, nostrils flaring at the unfamiliar scent of garbage and frying oil, while Croal flinches at the sharp clang of a distant dumpster lid. Lila whispers, 'Stay close—keep your heads down.' Ribbick boldly steps ahead, peering around a dumpster, determined to reach the street, while Croal hesitates, his skin slick from rain, gripping Ribbick's arm. Lila checks her phone for security alerts, her urgency growing as headlights sweep across the alley, prompting all three to duck behind a pile of crates. Their objective is to reach the subway entrance two blocks away before security can lock down the perimeter. The result: the trio narrowly evades a patrolling guard, slipping into the shadows, driven by Lila's need to protect her creations and Ribbick's urge to explore the world beyond the lab, even as Croal anxiously urges caution and retreat.",

Croal, cautious and tense, lingers in the shadows, watching both Lila and Ribbick with wary eyes while keeping one hand pressed to the damp wall for stability. Lila attempts to coax both mutants closer, offering them a wrapped protein bar and holding out her hand, while Ribbick refuses, demanding answers about their purpose and safety. Croal, torn between his loyalty to Ribbick and his desire for escape, inches forward but snatches the protein bar and retreats, his gaze darting nervously down a side tunnel. The scene ends with Lila promising protection if they cooperate, leading Ribbick to signal Croal to follow, and the trio move deeper into the sewer as distant footsteps echo—hinting the security team is closing in.",

Lila uses the codes to access the restricted files, downloading critical mutation data onto a portable drive. Marcus, motivated by his ambition and fear of discovery, hesitates before suggesting they erase the digital logs. Lila, determined to protect her creations, agrees and directs Marcus to the main terminal.

Croal presses himself against the cool metal wall, his nostrils flaring at the scent of cold rain and unfamiliar chemicals, his gaze darting between Lila and the exit. Lila thrusts a lab coat at Ribbick, urging, 'Cover your skin—humans outside will notice.' Ribbick shrugs the coat over his shoulders, croaking softly, 'We must move quickly. I sense danger in the vibrations.' Croal hesitates, his eyes lingering on the puddles, then grips Ribbick’s arm, urging caution: 'It’s not safe out there. We know the water, not the world.' Lila pushes the door open, cold air and rain spilling into the corridor, and gestures them forward: 'We have no choice—the security team is coming.'
