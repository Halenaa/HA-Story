She pulls a slim, high-end leather suitcase—its brand new sheen standing out in the crowd—behind her, signaling her newfound wealth. Marek Visser, leaning against a pillar and observing the flow of commuters, notices Xiao Fang's deliberate movements and expensive luggage. He approaches her, wiping rain from his glasses, and offers a folded city map in exchange for a briefcase of cash she nonchalantly reveals, testing his intentions. Xiao Fang hands him a business card with only a phone number and says, 'Meet me at the Oude Kerk at noon. Don't be late.' Marek nods, pocketing the card and glancing at the suitcase, weighing his options. Xiao Fang strides out into the rain, hailing a black Mercedes taxi with a crisp wave and stepping inside, leaving Marek to study the card and make his decision. The objective is to establish Xiao Fang's entry, display her resources, and initiate the first contact with Marek; as a result, a tentative alliance is set in motion.",

Marek Visser sits opposite, his fingers curled around a chipped espresso cup, eyes scanning the café’s corners as he listens. Xiao Fang leans forward, sliding half the notes toward Marek and saying, 'With this, we buy silence and loyalty. I want names—people who matter.' Marek nods, scribbling a list onto a napkin with a borrowed pen, his motivation clear: to prove his analytical worth and gain a foothold in Xiao Fang’s rising organization. The café’s owner glances nervously at the visible cash, and Xiao Fang meets his eye, tapping the table with a manicured nail as a silent warning. The stack of money on the table and Xiao Fang's unflinching gaze signal her newfound financial power, intimidating both Marek and the onlookers. As the rain intensifies, Marek tears off the napkin and hands it to Xiao Fang, cementing their alliance.",
