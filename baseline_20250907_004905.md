# Chapter 1: The Ruby Cloak

In the heart of Elderwood, where the trees touched the sky and the wolves sang beneath the silver moon, lived a girl named Isla. Every morning, rays of sunlight sneaked through the branches and illuminated the walls of her cottage, warming the rooms with cheerful golden pools.

Isla was not her village’s most obedient child. Her mother often said she was made of wildflowers and woodland dust, forever wandering off, chasing frogs, or listening for secrets whispered in the wind. But Isla was good-hearted, and her gaze—curious as the dawn—softened even the grumpiest woodcutter’s heart.

One misty morning, her grandmother pressed into Isla's hands a cloak of richest ruby, shimmering like embers, stitched from velvet and threaded with patience.  
“You must wear this, child,” Grandmother cooed, brushing a rebellious curl from Isla’s brow.  
“It will keep you warm, and the color will make you bright as a cardinal in winter. Remember, it will never tear, and wolves will know to keep their distance should they see it.”  
Isla twirled, letting the cloak billow. “Does it have magic too, Nana?”  
Grandmother smiled, eyes creasing at the corners. “Its magic is in the courage you find wearing it. And maybe just a hint of luck.”

Isla promised to wear it always. Yet, that afternoon, as she splashed at the stream and danced on mossy stones, she wondered if the cloak might attract more than just admiring gazes—perhaps it would call to the darker dwellers of Elderwood.

# Chapter 2: Forest Promises

One day, Isla’s mama beckoned her over, voice taut with worry.  
“Your Grandmother’s been ill,” she said, pressing a basket into Isla’s arms, full of honey cakes and healing herbs. “Take these to her. She’s alone, and the path is wild. Keep the cloak close and don’t stray.”

Isla nodded solemnly.  
“I won’t stray from the path. I promise.”

But as she stepped into the forest, every root and rustle begged for her attention. The wind played harmonies, and bluebells bobbed as if in greeting. Isla hummed a melody, the ruby cloak billowing behind her.

Halfway to Grandmother’s house, a voice slithered from the shadows:

“Little red bird—where do you hurry?’’

Isla startled, gripping the basket’s handle. A wolf, tall and silver-eyed, emerged from the brambles. His fur glinted in fractured sunlight, and his voice, though polite, carried a wild edge.

“To my grandmother’s,” Isla replied, voice steady.

The wolf’s gaze lingered on the cloak.  
“That is a clever cape, child. You must be very brave.”  
“Brave enough,” Isla replied. “And hungry. Are you?”  
The wolf smirked. “I eat what the forest provides. Sometimes berries. Sometimes rabbits. Occasionally, a child…”  
Isla flinched, but the wolf grinned, showing a single bright fang.  
“Only joking. What goodies ride in your basket today?”

Isla hesitated, but a plan stirred in her adventurous mind.  
“Sweet honey cakes,” she answered carefully. “They make the old strong and the wounded well.”

The wolf licked his lips. “Are you certain you know the way to your grandmother’s house? I know all the secret paths, shortcuts and hidden tunnels. If you want, I could show you the prettiest wildflowers on a path only foxes use.”

Isla shook her head.  
“Thank you, Mister Wolf, but I promised not to stray. Besides, wildflowers are best found, not shown.”

The wolf’s smile faded, replaced by something colder.  
“Such wisdom for one so young.”

Isla stepped backward, feeling the ruby cloak’s gentle hug about her shoulders.

“It’s not wisdom. It’s what my mother told me.”

# Chapter 3: Between Brambles

Suspicion gnawed at Isla’s thoughts as she hurried on. The wolf’s words had curled inside her like smoke, hard to ignore.

She almost missed the cardinal’s song—the friendliest tune in the forest.  
“Red, red! Look at me!”

A cardinal swooped down, landing on the basket.  
“Little Mistress, the wolf is up to cleverness today. He’s racing to the old woman’s house. Trust the cloak. Go swift!”  
Isla’s heart lurched.  
“Thank you, dear bird!” she called, and dashed ahead.

She raced past thickets and startled rabbits, her cloak streaming behind her like fire.

A heavy hush fell as she approached the cottage. The door hung ajar, shadows snagging the entrance. Isla stopped, listening. Her heart tapped a frantic tune.

She crept inside.

# Chapter 4: The Wolf’s Masquerade

Inside, the cottage was strange—neat, but not familiar. The wolf, wrapped in shawl and cap, lounged in Grandmother’s bed.

“Come in, child…”  
The wolf’s voice struggled for softness, but the growl slipped through.

Isla hesitated. “Grandmother? You sound ill.”

The wolf beckoned her closer.  
“My medicines are failing. Bring me the cakes, child.”

Isla set down the basket, searching for a way to stall.  
“What big eyes you have, Grandmother.”  
“The better to see you with, my dear,” the wolf whispered.  
“And what large ears!”  
“The better to hear your secrets.”  
“And what sharp teeth…”  
The wolf’s patience snapped. “The better to eat you with—”

Suddenly, Isla threw her ruby cloak over the wolf’s head, blinding him. He thrashed, snapping and growling.

At that moment, Grandmother sprang from beneath the bed where she’d hidden. She grabbed a broom and whacked the wolf, who stumbled, tangled in velvet and panic.

Isla seized a fire poker, brandishing it.  
“Leave us, thief!” she demanded.

The wolf scrambled out the window, falling in a heap. The cardinal, waiting outside, pecked at his tail in triumph.

# Chapter 5: A Cloak’s True Power

Isla collapsed into Grandmother’s arms, trembling.

“Oh Nana,” she whispered, “I kept the path, and the cloak held strong.”
Grandmother brushed her tangled hair.
“Bravery isn’t never being afraid, my darling—it’s choosing heart over fear, even when the woods grow deep.”

Isla nodded, breath steadying.

They shared honey cakes, and the red cloak hung in the window, gleaming in morning sunlight.

Outside, the wolf nursed his pride and swore never again to tangle with a girl who wore her courage so bright.

The forest watched and whispered, tales of the little red cloak weaving into every wind, every shadow, and every heart.
