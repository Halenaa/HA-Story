**HA-Story** is a comprehensive AI-powered story creation system that transforms creative ideas into complete novels through a structured 5-step process. The system integrates advanced AI agents, multi-dimensional conflict detection, and intelligent quality control mechanisms to produce high-quality narrative content.

## Key Features

### Core Story Creation Pipeline
- **Outline Generation**: AI-driven story structure planning
- **Character Development**: Intelligent character creation and consistency tracking
- **Story Expansion**: Progressive narrative development
- **Dialogue Integration**: Context-aware dialogue insertion and enhancement
- **Story Enhancement**: Quality improvement and refinement

### Advanced AI Systems
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Specialized agents for different story aspects
- **Conflict Detection**: Multi-dimensional conflict analysis and resolution
- **Quality Control**: Automated story evaluation and improvement
- **Synchronization Engine**: Maintains consistency across all story elements
- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive story quality metrics

### Web Interface
- **Streamlit Web App**: User-friendly interface with ~10,000 lines of code
- **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators
- **Interactive Controls**: Fine-grained parameter adjustment
- **Session Management**: Save and restore creation sessions

## Architecture Overview

The system follows a modular 7-layer architecture:

```
Web Interface Layer (Streamlit)
    ↓
Core Business Logic (Main Pipeline)
    ↓
Content Generation Layer (AI Agents)
    ↓
Quality Control Layer (Analysis & Evaluation)
    ↓
Synchronization Layer (State Management)
    ↓
Utilities Layer (Tools & Helpers)
    ↓
Data Layer (JSON Storage)
```

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key or Anthropic API key
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Halenaa/HA-Story.git
   cd HA-Story
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Download language models**
   ```bash
   python -c "import spacy; spacy.cli.download('en_core_web_sm')"
   python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Web Interface (Recommended)
```bash
streamlit run outline_generator_app.py
```
Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8501`

#### Command Line Interface
```bash
python main_pipeline_glm.py --user-input "Your story idea here" --genre "fantasy"
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Web Interface Workflow

1. **Start the Application**: Launch the Streamlit web interface
2. **Configure Settings**: Set up AI model preferences and parameters
3. **Input Story Concept**: Provide your initial story idea
4. **Follow the Pipeline**: Complete each of the 5 creation steps
5. **Review and Export**: Download your completed story

### 2. Pipeline Steps

#### Step 1: Outline Generation
- Input your story concept and genre
- AI generates a structured story outline
- Review and modify the generated outline

#### Step 2: Character Development  
- Create detailed character profiles
- Establish character relationships and conflicts
- Generate character backstories and motivations

#### Step 3: Story Expansion
- Transform outline into full narrative
- Maintain plot consistency and pacing
- Generate detailed scene descriptions

#### Step 4: Dialogue Integration
- Analyze dialogue insertion opportunities
- Generate character-appropriate dialogue
- Ensure natural conversation flow

#### Step 5: Enhancement & Polish
- Apply narrative transitions
- Improve language fluency
- Final quality control and refinement

### 3. Advanced Features

#### Multi-Agent System
The system employs specialized AI agents:
- **Dialogue Agent**: Handles conversation generation
- **Conflict Manager**: Identifies and resolves story conflicts
- **Agent Coordinator**: Manages inter-agent communication
- **Consensus Engine**: Ensures agreement between agents

#### Quality Control
- **Coherence Analysis**: Logical plot development
- **Character Consistency**: Behavioral pattern tracking
- **Emotional Development**: Natural character growth
- **Language Fluency**: Grammar and style improvement
- **Structural Completeness**: Story arc validation

## Configuration

### Model Settings
Configure AI models in the web interface:
