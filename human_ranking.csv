While the concepts and plots are strong, the emotional arcs can sometimes feel secondary to the technological ideas. In Stories 1 and 2 (the cyberpunk thrillers), the emotional transitions were often functional, serving the plot rather than feeling like deep, organic character growth. The focus was on action and tech.  Story 3, while highly creative, had the most abrupt emotional beats. The confrontation and resolution with the AI unit felt more like a logical puzzle than an emotionally charged moment.  Even Story 4, which excelled in this area, could have delved slightly deeper into the grandmother's personal history and fears to make her resilience even more powerful.",Novel and scientifically plausible settings;Clear and logical plot development;Well-developed and believable characters;Natural emotional expression and character growth;Fluent and engaging writing style;Rich imagination and creative concepts;Complete and well-structured narrative;Thought-provoking themes and ideas,Just right,Moderate,45-60 minutes,Very positive,"This was a genuinely interesting experiment. I appreciated the clever concept of exploring a single narrative frame through different sci-fi lenses. It made the evaluation process much more engaging than reviewing unrelated stories. The contrast between the poetic, philosophical tone of Story 4 and the gritty, technical action of Stories 1 and 2 was particularly effective. The questions were well-chosen and covered all the key aspects of what makes a story work. My only small note would be to make the instruction to evaluate each story separately a bit more prominent initially to avoid any confusion. Overall, it was a thoughtful and well-constructed survey."
